Service is prompt and professional, quality of food adheres to their standards - no complaints here. A big plus is also that it's not too crowded compared to other outlets situated in shopping malls. The only downside is that noise adsorption is poor and you'll find yourself having to shout to hear yourself. Otherwise one of my favorite DTF outlets.",

They are well know as an excellent place for great dumplings. I had the shrimp dumpling soup and roast duck in pastry and it was all excellent. The staff was friendly and efficient but way too busy scurrying about taking care of guest's every need they didn't have time to stop and chat or hover. I was struck by the attention to detail when I set my shoulder bag down next to my chair, within seconds the waitress appeared with a small stand with cloth basket for me to put my bag into then covered it with a cloth that slid in close to the table. This kept my bag handy at the same time not leaving it exposed for possible tampering or theft, I saw these baskets at other tables and had no idea what the customers were carrying and if someone did want to get to the contents it would be immediately evident to anyone nearby. I thought this small courtesy for the customers spoke volumes about attitude of management in providing added service to the customers.",

It is traditionally prepared in xiaolong, small bamboo steaming baskets, which give them their name. A visit to Din Tai Fung is a cultural experience which starts waiting outside where you are handed a clipboard to mark off the dumplings you want to eat. You get a number and when that number is called you go inside and get seated at a table. You can see the buns being steamed and even though the service seems to be a bit disorganised the Xian Long Bao are superb. I opted for the Minced Pork with Truffles which were amazing and the Prawn dumplings... Both were excellent. My 7 dumplings and a bottle of Evian water came to SG$20.35 (about GB\u00a312.35) which is a little expensive but worth every penny. A delicious and very authentic dining experience.",

The abalone soup had great depth of flavour, the ribs were simply succulent and the lobster and tofu dishes were delectable. As for the noodle, it was cooked \u201cal dente\u201d, just the way we liked it. The restaurant provided us with longevity buns in place of a birthday cake, which was a lovely touch.We would like to take this opportunity to complement Larry for taking care of our dining needs as well as the crew of Rosy and Howard.

Firstly you could have dim sum at dinner ( many only do it for lunch) the mixed deluxe platter selection was delicious. Peking duck was a generous serving and tasty. The lobster (think slipper) was tender and obviously freshly cooked...we had it with spicy shrimp. Special mention to the sommelier. We ordered a Nebiolo...when they did not have that he came to the table with 3 alternate bottles and suggested a French Medoc which went beautifully with all we were eating...and cheaper than the one we had ordered. I usually judge a place by the fried rice (I admit, rightly or wrongly) the rice with shrimp and ginger was superb. The restaurant has a modern feel with interesting mirror and lighting effects.

Their char siew is coated with absolutely heavy amount of sugar to create the crisp on the outer layer. You can actually bite and feel the layer of sugar which I find it disgusting. Yes all char siew have sugar but this one has major sugar coated on it and no this does not melt in the mouthDimsum basket - Just very very regular, the pork siumai topped with abalone was bad I thought. The pork fillings was soft and tasteless - I thought I was having chicken, har kau was just normal, xiao long bao not as fantastic as Din Tai FungTruffle duck - This is definitely better than the above, surprisingly this was my favourite of all. The duck was very nicely done, skin is very crispy and the meat is still tender. Light truffle fragrance which is just nice.Overall? I don't think I will come for their dimsum - very subpar dimsum.Service:The lady who attended to us had a nice smile. The only problem is mgmt - you need to train your staffs to tell the difference between the buffet and ala carte menu. Clearly we know the diff is one is unlimited order and the other one is pay per order. She answered that, which is pretty self-explanatory, which is a very silly answer. What I wanted to know is what can we can in ala carte that we can't in the buffet.

We ordered a variety of dishes including the barbecue pork, Peking duck, garden deep fried dim sum platter, stir fried red yeast scallop, venison with asparagus, braised tofu, French beans with chicken and minced turnip, accompanied by stir fried noodle and fried rice. Menu choices were ably and helpfully assisted by very knowledgeable waiting staff.We can honestly say that all the dishes were really very very good, the standouts being the barbecue pork which was both unbelievable succulent and crispy with a wonderful richness and depth of barbecue flavours. The Peking duck was elegant, with beautifully crispy skin and succulent meat. The garden deep fried dim sum platter was visually stunning and each element accurately cooked with great flavours. The scallop dish was good but I though very slightly over cooked, and the venison wrapped asparagus was a triumph of accurate cooking, great flavours and clever presentation. The tofu and bean dishes were accurately cooked and tasty. It almost didn\u2019t matter that the accompanying fried rice was a little dry, the noodles were perfect. The food was accompanied by a very palatable prosecco and teaWe finished the the meal with beautifully presented longevity buns.Service was polite, friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful, and created a lovely atmosphere. Prices were reasonable for this very high standard of modern style Cantonese cuisine.It was a memorable meal, we would definitely eat here again. We all had a really good evening, including our youngest guest (4 1/2 years old).",

Most are small square tables for two or they can be joined together to cater for more people. Not a great ambiance for a up market Chinese restaurant.Both the Cod fish and Chilean Sea bass were excellent. The fried Wagyu beef was average but the portion was small and the dish was expensive. The truffle roast duck was something that all of us agreed, to be the best.Staff were not very attentive. Plates were not changed after every dish.

On top of our favourite dishes; namely the Crispy roasted pork belly, Mitzo special barbecued pork and Black truffle crispy roast duck, we tried a few other dishes on the menu... the black garlic in the poached cabbage was good. I love the fried rice with ginger, shrimp and tobiko too! Every dish comes with a pleasant surprise... I can see that the Chef puts in a lot of effort not only to present us with delicious food but the presentation of the food makes it very appetising. However, I have to say that the portion are pretty small... The service staff are very responsive and friendly too... As we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, we brought along a cake and have requested it to be kept in the fridge to be served after meal. When we were ready to have the cake, all of us have a pleasant surprise. It was not just the cake they have delivered to our table... What came out took our breath away...

She was the reason my dinner experience at Mitzo was the best ever in Singapore.There were 5 of us, and as soon as we were seated, we informed Wan Yee that we have brought along a bottle of red wine. Straight away Azlam from the bar came and offered to decant the wine. Then we bought a bottle of white wine, because it is better than paying $60 ++ for corkage. Wan Yee brought over glasses for the white wine and informed us that glasses for the red will come later when we are ready for the red.We selected 5 courses. The first course was a selection of 4 appetizers : softshell crab with curry (chicken) floss, which was quite light; deep fried seafood tofu coated with spicy seaweed, which was quite heavy; battered lotus stuffed with truffle shrimp, which was pretty good; roasted coffee pork neck served with crispy beancurd skin and Chinese pancake, which was seriously yummy. Everyone was truly impressed with the tender delicious meat and the crispy beancurd skin. The contrast in texture was fantastic.Our second course were 5 half Boston lobsters served in various ways. We selected 'oven baked with cheese topped with bonito flakes', and 'steamed topped with minced black and white garlic in soya sauce'. At $30 ++ each half lobster, it was reasonable value.Our third course were 2 dishes - half roasted duck with black truffle sauce and half roasted chicken with crispy garlic. At this juncture Wan Yee brought us glasses for the red wine. And on her own initiative she divided the meat into 5 two-portions and had them plated so beautifully the dishes tasted twice as good. Our fourth course were 2 dishes : stirfried wild mushroom with Chinese kailan and pine nuts; homemade egg tofu with crabmeat and mushroom in spinach sauce. Again Wan Yee on her own initiative divided the 2 dishes into 5 two-portions for each of us, with beautiful plating, making the course twice as delicious.By now we were thoroughly overwhelmed by the fantastic service. But the best was yet to come. The fifth course was a combination of 5 desserts. The Chinese assorted pastries, and the chilled avocado milk shake, were arranged so artistically, it was an 'ikebana' moment. When the dry ice was activated, everyone went \"wow' . Even the next table was impressed. The restaurant had outdone itself this time. Wan Yee stood beside the table beaming from ear to ear. She was so pleased.Our dinner was elevated from a mere dining experience to a feast for the eyes and a feast for the palate, because of the fantastic service which exceeded everyone's expectations.And KUDOS to everyone in the kitchen.

Of the three signature soups only I rather enjoyed mine - the double-boiled sea cucumber with chicken mushroom in pork consomme. I was urged to have a try of the Braised lobster soup with crab meat & tofu...by my trying-to-be-polite regular dining partner - my personal view: it was frightful - a total 'con-fusion' of neither east nor west! Even my colleague's Braised fish maw with seafood in carrot broth did not get it's 'signature' rating by her.Then, the least expected roasted coffee pork neck (I dislike coffee flavoured food) served with crispy beancurd skin and Chinese pancake brought smiles to all three of us - if we had known, we would have order two portions of this delightful dish. Indeed worth the 'signature' rating and the price/value.Unfortunately, the rest of the other 'signature' dishes went down the drain. While the Signature Roast Pork offers quality meat, we could literally hear the sugar crunching bite from the residue of the caramelised marinate - there goes the sugar level for the day.To enjoy the meat, we started scraping off the layer of caramel coating to reduce the exaggerated sweetness of the char siew.The Mitzo PREMIUM steamed dim sum platter at $25 for six pieces of three assortments was considered premium only because of the unnecessary dollop of black cavier, 'missed' baby abalone and what was supposed to be siao long bao semblance. We were three in a party, they could not oblige adding one piece more but we had to pay another $25 for another platter (mind you we were not told we could not just have one more piece each when we requested for it).I love red yeast and it's a rare treat to find this being offered but as in the PREMIUM steamed dim sum platter, in my humble opinion - the chef might as well dispense with the red yeast in the Stir-fried red yeast scallop served with lily bulb and seasonal greens.While I enjoyed the simple, no-nonsense Fried Shanghai spicy noodles with mushroom and bean sprouts my other two dining mates begged to differ - the only dish we differed in opinion.I simply cannot resist Egg Plant which I could have done without but I am on a quest to find the best Chinese Egg Plant dish, I requested for it with rice. Song He rice the waitress carried out the packaging when I enquired why the rice grain failed the rice test (I could reform the rice grain). The service was quite attentive and they tried to pacify us at best with complimentary desserts - mine was interesting - but when the diluted yellow liquid just gushed out with a bite into the bun - that was it - luckily it squirt not stain anyone.Like I mentioned, perhaps, we went on a wrong day.",

As a fan of dim sum, I think Mitzo did a pretty good job re-interpreting the Chinese dim sum.1. The double boiled soup of the day was very delicious. This delicious soup was boiled with chicken and unknown herbs. The flavours came together very well.2. Mitzo char siew, aka \"special barbecued pork\". Truly a nice honeyed twist to the traditional and ubiquitous char siew. I was told it is a best seller of the restaurant and that some patrons came simply to enjoy this dish.3. Wild mushroom and truffle bun was a wonderful sight. The pau were decorated like real Shitake mushrooms, served on a bedding of make believe ground. I am not a fan of truffles, but others in my group enjoyed it.4. Custard moon bun, aka liu-sha pau. Another aesthetic twist that is truly pleasant to the eyes. The custard itself flowed out freelyl but I think it tasted so-so. 5. Har-gow. A good Chinese dim sum must be judged based on 1 particular dish, that is the har-gow. I approve this restaurant based on its har-gow dish. 6. Other seafood dishes. Bamboo clam, lobster and braised abalone with tofu all looked enticing when served but all of them tasted average. Nothing to shout about.7. Crispy duck roll. While I'm usually a big fan of all things duck, I found this particular dish to be the black sheep of the restaurant.8. Hokkaido millk cheese tart.

I had called in advance to arrange for surprise Chinese birthday lotus buns (shou bao) to be served at the end of the meal together with a birthday cake which we would bring. The restaurant exceeded our expectations by preparing a nice trolley where the cake was placed together with complimentary fresh fruits, sesami balls AND birthday lotus buns.

It's quite difficult to find a place that could fit a party of 16 at 1 table in Singapore but Mitzo was able to do it. They sent me pictures of the venue and also gave us the beautiful room with the live jellyfish as they felt that it would make the occasion even more memorable. It certainly did! Overall Experience: Thoughtful and Personalized Dining Experience Meal: Fusion Cantonese Cuisine with a Modern Twist without any Compromise on Taste.Sylvia from Mitzo was incredibly helpful. She found out the dining and food preferences of my family members and took the effort to communicate these with the Chef. We managed to customize the entire menu for my family members, and those with dietary restrictions and didn't fancy pork were offered the Dim Sum Appetizer. 1. Appetizer Platter of (BBQ Pork, Roasted Pork Belly, Soft Shell Crab)2. Double Boiled Abalone Soup with Morel Mushroom in Chicken Consomme 3. Oven Baked Cod Fish with Lemongrass, Chilli and Spices4. Truffle Crispy Roast Duck with Stir Fried Asparagus and Scallop5. Braised Boston Lobster with Hand Pulled Noodles 6. Chilled Avocado Milkshake served with Depp Fried Chocolate & Wine Sesame Dumpling The food was individually plated and Sylvia would introduce each dish before it was served. Food presentation and quantity was consistent, and quality was impeccable. Pacing was perfect and not rushed. The BBQ Pork and Roasted Pork Belly were the highlights of the dinner. Those dishes were without a doubt the best I've ever tasted! Atmosphere: Contemporary interior that was sophisticated but cosyWalking into Mitzo for the first time, we were amazed to see the outdoor bar! Definitely made a note to try it next time. Our room was large enough to fit all 16 of us, comfortably spaced. My family instantly took a liking to the jellyfish aquarium, which really set the ambience for a relaxed dinner. Air con was a little cold initially but that was adjustable as well. Service: Indelible professionals with a sharp eye for detail This was what made our dinner at Mitzo such a success. The staff, led by Sylvia, welcomed us warmly and made every single effort to ensure that each of our guests were comfortable. I was very impressed that Sylvia actually assigned one of her staff, Eazt, a charming gentleman who could speak cantonese, to personally attend to my grandmother throughout the dinner. She picked it up over our phone conversation when I was just casually mentioning about my grandma. That level of detail is not something you see often in many restaurants in Singapore. The bartenders were also happy to create cocktails based on our likes and preferences, which I thought was a real bonus! Kudos especially to Azlam, who really made beautiful and tantalizing customized cocktails!At the end of the dinner, the staff rolled in our birthday cake, complete with dry ice effect and decorations!

Both segments of the brunch were disappointing.First, before we discuss the food, the service needs to be mentioned. We had appalling service at our table. We were seated at the first section near the entrance alongside two other tables of four (namely a table of four adults and a table of two adults with two children). One Esther waited on all our tables. She changed plates for the other tables, offered them dessert before they ordered, and even brought a complimentary fruit juice to one of the adults who promptly informed her that she had not requested for it. On the other hand, for reasons only known to herself, she never changed our plates until we asked for it and when we placed our orders (for the ala carte buffet) twice they never arrived and she never bothered to check on our orders. The straw to break the camel's back came when at the end of the buffet she can to inform us that the dessert we ordered through her some 25 minutes ago is no longer available as the chef had (according to her) gone home. When asked why this could happen given that we placed our order 25 minutes ago she just kept saying the chef had gone home and she refused to explain what caused this mistake. Interestingly, when we insisted that she resolve this by properly explaining herself or checking back with the kitchen, she then disappeared and a male waiter came up to get our bill and serve us the desserts we had ordered 25 minutes ago (which she said was not available as the chef had gone home). In case you're wondering, this Esther never came back to our table to explain / apologies for her (at least) oversight.Second, the food was at best passable. We ordered a variety of dim sum and stir fried dishes. Save for the black cos dumpling the rest were but average Dim Sum which could not surpass Crystal Jade Kitchen standards. As for the stir fried, the stir fried scallop with egg white was just a swamp of egg white with barely one scallop sliced into bits in between, and five huge slices of broccoli decorations. Bland and uneventful, that was a total disappointment. (See photo of said dish below, you would be hard pressed to spot anything other than egg white and broccoli, what a rip off.) The beef cubes were average (you could get the same standard at zi char hawkers). The only saving graces were the stir fried fish fillet and the char siew. Stir fried fish fillet had enough wok hei and char siew was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. As for desserts, the dessert which we had to \"fight\" for, namely the aloe vera dessert, was refreshing (but no different from any Chinese restaurant), while the Hokkaido cheese cream puff was just a mouthful of cheese. Try the whisky chocolate liqueur puff if you are ever here - at least this is different from other Chinese restaurants.Third, the cocktails which we paid to top up for. The cocktails would at best pass for mocktails. As if to scrimp since this was a top up option for weekend brunch goers, ever drink tasted light and void of alcohol. Even when we asked them to remove some of the other non-alcoholic ingredients in the drink to try to help them improve their cocktails, the cocktails remained light and suited only for those who do not usually drink any alcohol. They have also done away with their bar counter where brunchers could make their own cocktails.In short, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The soups were traditional flavours with a modern twist, very inventive and one of a kind. I will be back to sink my teeth into more delicious modern canto dishes! The ambiance was cool and trendy. My husband and i preferred sitting next to each other as the tables were a little too long for a cosy conversation, we might have had to speak much louder to one another if so.Only issue we had was with the service staff, a waitress unpleasantly surprised us with the bill in the middle of our meal. This incident happened at 10pm and we had just ordered more food. I refused to be made to search through my bag while eating and take out my card to settle a bill when I had not received my complete order or finished my meal. This was so off putting that it deterred me from wanting to order dessert and made me feel hurried to eat and leave. We told her that this was unacceptable, only upon insisting did she go away.Aslam, your bar staff on the other hand made up for that horrible incident. He took such good care of us, he was friendly, professional and provided faultless service. He deserves the highest compliment for his genuine good work attitude. He was the saving grace to our night.Thank you Aslam and to the excellant culinary team. I hope you will look into this matter and I look forward to a favorable experience the next time round.",

Here are the highlights of the food:I started with a trio of appetizers - Deep fried oyster with bonito seaweed seasoning, Chicken in 20 year old wine, Fried prawn with truffles and peanut mayo sauce and squid salad with spicy mint mango dressing. The prawn and oyster were good. Next up was the soup. I had the Pumpkin pork ribs soup with pacific clam and king oyster mushroom. It's amazing to have pumpkin soup done the Chinese way! The clams were palm-sized and cut into chunks. I thought I was eating oyster mushroom but it was soft and mildly chewy. Oyster mushroom were pan fried for a short while before cooking. Nice! This was followed by Wok-fried truffles lobster. The lobster was meaty and the truffle sauce was good!I then had the Pan-fried king prawn in asparagus skewer with truffle sauce. Prawn was fresh and juicy. Interetesting presentation was the 'sharpened' asparagus that looks like a pen/ calligraphy brush.I also had two pieces of osmanthus wagyu beef, which had good marbling and it\u2019s so tender. I ended the savoury part of the meal with the Fried vermicelli (tang hoon) in mushroom broth with crab meat, topped with fried minced garlic that were crispy and added a nice flavor to the noodles.

In the day its There are 42 items on the ala carte buffet menu. The buffet costs $68++ per pax. For an additional $50++, you can enjoy free flow of cocktails, wines and other beverages. Here are the star dishes that I really enjoyed:- Mitzo Special BBQ Pork: This is especially good. You can't stop at one piece. This Mitzo Special BBQ Pork is really good. The caramelised outer edges and the meat that is flavourful and yummy! - Crispy Pork Belly served with bun: Roast Pork Belly in Chinese Bun. A good alternative to the traditional 'Kong Bah' (Braised Pork Belly) Bun.- Vegetable Bun: Bao made to look like mushroom. Break open the bun, and the smell of truffle entices you to savour it. Really nice. Presentation is further enhanced by deep fried vermicelli to look like hay and flowers. - Double-boiled soup of the day: Melon, pork rib and red dates. The pork is really soft and tender.- Braised Truffles Udon: Absolutely love this truffle wok-fried udon! I could eat this all by myself! - Poached Cabbage in Lobster Bisque: Cabbage leaves boiled till soft and a lobster bisque sauce poured over the cabbage. Its unique, and not bad.- Custard Bun: Definitely one of the better and more unique 'Liu Sha Bao' (Molten Salted Egg Yolk Lava Bun) that I have had. Pandan flavored salted egg yolk steamed bun with mixed sesame seeds. It's to-die-for.- Double-boiled almond cream with black sesame glutinous rice ball: Must try. The almond cream is thick and creamy and when you bite into the glutinous rice ball, the black sesame oozes out, giving a nice contrast.- Aloe Vera with Osmanthus Jelly: Served in a transparent disposable square cup, its refreshing. Other items I tried included:- Poached Dumpling with Sichuan Sauce: Dumpling poached and the sauce is mildly sweet and spicy. - Stir-fried Scallop with Egg White: Egg white beaten and folded with scallop meat. I hae tried this dish with fish meat before, but this is a first. The dish comes with a raw egg yolk, which the server adds vinegar and pepper before mixing them all together. Its nice.- Wasabi infused Baked Fish: Taste of the wasabi was mild. Plating looks good. - Braised Congee with Scallops: Would have preferred it to be more smooth like traditional Cantonese porridge. - Fried Noodle with Black Pepper Shredded Chicken: This is like Ee noodles, stir fried with chicken. Mildly spicy. - Chilled Mango Cream with Sago and Pomelo Topping: Served in small portion, Overall a nice meal, where there\u2019s good variety of dim sum prepared to order.

Tall glass panels tinted in various hues that divide the long space into smaller intimate areas; full height glass windows overlooking Orchard Road; tasteful mirrored ceilings; fresh and attractive soft furnishings; imaginative lighting.....Mitzo has the most creative decor of any restaurant I've been to in a long time, completely unique for a Chinese restaurant. We had the $28++ \"have a break\" 4 course set lunch. This was served very quickly as the restaurant had promised - good for people in a hurry - with all the courses arriving at the same time. The ingredients used in our dishes were basic (eg crabstick starter and dory fish main), but this was the lowest cost set lunch, and we had no cause to complain. The food tasted and looked good. The cooking was above average, and the presentation had an elegant, contemporary, simplicity that was pleasing. Each set lunch course could be upgraded for an extra cost (eg to a duck starter or a scallop main course etc), ranging from $5 for a starter to $14 for a main course. An upgrade of all four courses would potentially have added up to an additional $32. We might visit again to try the relatively large a-la-carte menu, which showcases the chef's repertoire and creativity, although prices looked somewhat steep. Dishes range from traditional Cantonese favourites to some interesting offerings that I've never encountered before.

Other favourites of ours - five spiced oysters in lettuce wrap, giant Garupa fins in claypot, braised abalone in rich superior stock, birds nest soup steamed with rock sugar, Beijing duck (ask for meat to be simply served with jus), foie gras and chicken fried rice, yusheng raw fish salad at Chinese New Year. Basically all good!Usual wine including Chinese rice wines and tea lists are extensive and good. Lychee Oolong tea is recommended. BYOB with corkage is an option. Here\u2019s to the Chef, the front of house team - thank you for the wonderful experiences , and there have been so many, and wishing all of you continuing success. You deserve more than the 1 star even if it means we can\u2019t just walk in anymore - booking is now essential. ",

Was there for a birthday celebratory dimsum/a la carte meal and ordered the signature Pan-fried Shredded Yam, Pumpkin, fluffy charsiew buns, pork trotter in black vinegar and pan fried glutinous rice. For the a la carte dishes, we had the delightful and special Fried Fish Noodles, Shredded Chicken, Ginger, Spring Onions, which was the highlight of the meal as well as the well-marinated smoked duck in Chinese tea leaves (apparently the fat london duck tasted way better than the local duck we had previously... probably the fat did the trick to retain the moisture to the meat). All diners should try the fried fish noodles at Summer Pavilion because fish is used to make the noodles and the texture is uniquely flavorful and bouncy, you can't put a finger on the taste but it will definitely not disappoint your palate!Our delightful Front-of-House Captain, Mr Lee Chun Wai was great at setting the ambience right for the dimsum lunch and kindly arranged for the 5 longevity buns to accompany the birthday cake at the end of the meal.

All the food was exquisite. Between the two of us, we ordered marinated jellyfish, tea smoked chicken (this was incredible), lobster meat with poached crispy rice (my favourite dish of the evening), poached beef with golden mushroom, zucchini flower stuffed with prawn, chicken and mushroom, steamed sea perched fish with minced garlic and beancurd skin (this was also a highlight), trio egg spinach, and bamboo clam with golden mushroom and minced garlic (this was incredible). For dessert, we had the sweet warm sesame dumplings, and black glutinous rice with mango and coconut ice cream. In total, the entire dinner came up to $333, which is roughly $165 for each of us. However, it\u2019s worth noting that we ordered a bunch of plates to share, and all this food could\u2019ve comfortably fed 4 people, even with the S sized portions that we ordered. So if you come with 4 people and order all the same things, it would be about $85 per head, which is possibly less than what you\u2019d spend at other fine dining restaurants in Singapore, and especially the Michelin Star ones. Having explained that price concept, I would TOTALLY recommend this place for its great service (when has the Ritz ever let anyone down with their service?), amazing food, and value for money.

It was supposed to be a special evening to celebrate a birthday and my partner and I were looking forward to an evening of good food and lovely ambience. However, there was a huge group of around 30 people who were at the restaurant for what I presumed was a Chinese New Year family gathering, and they were making so much noise with their constant \"Yum Sengs!\", \"Cheers!\" and general loud talking. My partner and I couldn't even make proper conversation throughout dinner. With that noise level, it felt like we were dining in a hawker centre and not a 1-Michelin Star fine-dining restaurant. We could tell that the customers at other tables were annoyed with the high noise level as well, from the frowns on their faces each time another loud round of toasting came from that group. I would be okay with the ruckus if this had been your usual Chinese family restaurant, but I was expecting a much classier and comfortable experience at the Summer Pavilion. The fact that my partner and I had to shout over the noise simply to hear each other spoiled the evening rather significantly for us. To be fair, the service staff was lovely and attentive, and we had some amazing food such as the Double-Boiled Sea Whelk Soup in Whole Coconut. But the pleasure of eating such fine food was ruined by the constant assault of loud noises throughout dinner. I do hope that the Summer Pavilion finds a way to mitigate the noise issue for the comfort of future patrons.",

We sent the Wagu beef back as it tasted like four cubes of un-chewable rubber in a brown tasteless gravy. However, no one came to our table to speak with us about it. The food was just taken away and that was the end of it. Now to the service: It was terrible, not because of slowness but because it was table-waiting on steroids. The food for the following course was brought while we were still eating the earlier course. On two occasions the waitress stood at our table with a course in her hand while we were still working through the previous course. $500+ and 1 hour and 15 minutes later it was all over. The next time I want a good Cantonese meal, I will go to one of the many much cheaper and better food options available in Singapore.",

When it returned with the other two it was warm not hot but by the time we were half way though the meal the cold room has reduced the food temperature to barely luke warm.The problem as we saw it was the food was delivered to the dining room hot but then stood around while our waiter got round to serving it by which time it was cooling rapidly, Then with the room temperature at around 20C the food continued to cool.If the room remains at the current temperature the restaurant should look mat have the food on warmers.We will be back as two of the dishes were excellent.",

There was an, at first, bewildering array of menu options but these were, in fact very well organised and gave us an excellent selection of options. While its not our normal practice to order other than a la carte, we ended up choosing the Chef's Tasting Menu and we were richly rewarded for placing our trust in the Chef. Each dish was beautifully presented and gave us delicious and interesting flavours, each balanced perfectly with its prime ingredient. This menu - impossible to give it justice in a short description - included barbecued scallop, pan fried prawns, a clam soup, saut\u00e9ed lamb loin, pan fried lobster, abalone and a particularly delicious green tea pudding dessert. We didn't choose the optional wine matching with this set menu, rather preferring to accompany the whole meal with a well-matched, dry and savoury Provence rose. This style of wine is all too often neglected as an amazing match with very high quality Asian dishes and it worked wonderfully with every dish. The service was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and, as a result, perfectly timed throughout. Located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, the Summer Pavilion has a particularly elegant ambience and is clearly aimed at the high end of the market - and it delivers both exceptional value for money and a truly enjoyable experience.",

Our go-to restaurant for Chinese New Year almost every year, the atmosphere right down to the cutlery, speak of class and elegance. Food was just as refined - The Yu Sheng to start and sweet desserts to complete - Summer Pavilion truly deserved the Michelin Star accolade. The Marinated Smoked Chicken, Chinese Tea Leaves was a must-try. Skin melted in the mouth - flavored with sauces that did not overwhelm and the light tea complemented the tenderness of the Chicken meat. The steamed Sea Perch tasted much better than my last visit. Consistency was key and the sea perch tasted a lot more balanced this time (XO sauce and spring onion). The braised Mini Lobster meat, Noodles was a little bland for me and I could not quite taste the sweetness of the lobster meat but my friend begged to differ - he had two servings - could be my palate that was overloaded. But I was totally blown away by the Chilled Apricot, Fungus Basil Seed dessert - every ingredient was fresh, chewy, and all in the right proportions. The chillness was of a moderate temperature and did not make my teeth chatter. Now the wonderful service. Mr Gery Lee - the restaurant manager truly made the difference. He opened the evening with the traditional Chinese New Year greetings and did it with so much gusto - it immediately drove the guests' adrenaline levels up many notches. Smiles were on our faces. The staff was attentive - water and tea was filled without any prompting. They were always there but never intrusive. You could be chatting at one point, you turned and tea was surreptitiously filled. They are Ninja trained. Mr Jef was so cheerful and each time he came to our table, we just couldn't not smile along. Chef Cheung came to the dining room and the compliments he received showed how much hard work Summer Pavilion had put in to make a restaurant deserving and diners appreciated.

It's a little more expensive than what you get in Crystal Jade type but it's well worth the price! Their peking duck is worth mentioning because they used egg crepe instead of the traditional pancake we usually get.

I had started becoming regular of this restaurant before out of the blue it managed to clinch 1 Michelin Star recently, a feat which I think is thoroughly well-deserved!There are several reasons why I put Summer Pavillion on the top of my list for Chinese cuisine in Singapore:- it is an \"all-rounder\": good for dim sum, traditional dishes, and fusion dishes. Hence, it is good for all kind of occasions any time of the day!- the ambience is simple but elegant, unlike many over-the-top Chinese restaurants. Starting from the warm lighting, the understated decor, the fine selection of china, the comfy chairs -- they make the experience complete.- the food quality is fantastic. Some of my favourites are: (i) barbecued Iberico, (ii) saut\u00e9ed chives, (iii) sliced Wagyu beef, (iv) black-pepper fried rice with goose liver. If you go for dim sum, try out: (i) crystal dumpling and (ii) fried pumpkin & yam. Finally, my meal at Summer Pavillion will never be complete without the dessert of black glutinous rice with mango cubes and coconut ice cream.The service, too, is impeccable. One of the staff, Sook Xian, is extremely observant and friendly. She always remembers what tea and drinks I like, as well as my favourite dishes -- humanising the concept of fine dining and making me feel like I am dining at home. The gentleman manager (his name just slipped my mind...) is always impressive. One Sunday brunch I brought an important guest for dim sum without realising he eats glutton-free meals. I was worried, but the manager calmed me down and on the spot recommended all the possible glutton-free dishes without even looking the menu! The brunch was salvaged by the manager indeed! :)The wine list is fantastic too, but they are very pricey vis-a-vis retail prices and other restaurants. This does not bother so much, though, as I gladly stick with the signature soothing peach Chinese tea.Overall, if you wish to have a fine Chinese dining experience in Singapore, it definitely cannot get any finer than Summer Pavillion.",

During my visit to the restaurant on the evening of 17 Oct 2016, he and the other servers provided near unparalleled service, better than some other fine dining restaurants that I have been to. Every dish served was carefully explained by the server, the Pu'er tea we ordered was constantly topped up and even replaced with warmer tea mid-meal, and asked about our satisfaction after every dish was cleared. They were considerate enough not to be intrusive, providing exceptional attention to details. On to the food, the quality was nothing short of outstanding. Living up to their Michelin star, perhaps even more than the 1 star they achieved, was their special degustation menu created by Head Chef Cheung. The meal was 6 courses, filling enough for the average Joe, and was made up of special dishes created by Chef Cheung that won an award post-Michelin, according to Jeffrey. The appetiser of Iberico pork and abalone, and the main course of lamb loin were the highlights of the seasonal degustation menu, which will change once every 3 months.

We were attracted to the Summer Pavillion as we always like to eat local food and this is reputedly the best Chinese Restaurant in town. We went for the Michelin menu. I was a bit disappointed that only one set menu was available, but the a la carte was so extensive I'd never have made up my mind. I won't go through each course but the food was really superb; by far the best Chinese I've ever had. It is rather soup-based, or at least a couple of the courses are accompanied by a broth. Also the dessert didn't quite reach the standard of the rest but I think that's a matter of personal taste rather than the quality of the cooking. The fight of wines is reasonably priced and very good quality but servings are not huge - just over half a glass of each. At around SG$ 100 for the menu and SG$ 48 for the wines (both plus tax and service) it's not cheap, but noting in Singapore is. compared other meals we had there it's good value for the fantastic quality. Service is excellent as well.",

We picked the Michelin Star set dinner because we didn't want to think too hard. It was well worth the money. The set consisted of iberico pork, abalone, sea whelk fish maw soup, Wagyu beef, poached rice with groupa and sweet almond tea. All was exquisitely done and wonderfully tasting. All of us love the double-boiled soup, delectable and nutritious. The Wagyu beef was so marblery and flavourful. Poached rice and groupa was drenched beautifully with milky fish soup and crispy bits added to an interesting palate. Service staff was very attentive, always there when we needed them but not intrusive and offering to take pictures for us without us having to ask. I credit this to good training and motivated staff. The entire dinner experience, from ambience to service to delicious good food and that consistent good vibe the moment you stepped into hotel and restaurant till you leave, all worthy of a six-star hotel.",

My friends and I were able to try a wider variety of dishes this time, among which the steamed fish and lobster were the most delicate. While the chef managed to retain the traditional flavor of the dishes (without the oiliness often associated with such traditional handling), the fresh taste of the fish and lobster were not compromised for one bit. The E-fu noodles that made with the lobster came as a pleasant surprise.The desserts we had (purple sticky rice with mango; mango, pomelo and sago sweet soup; and almond sweet soup) were good. But if you like fruity tea, a must-try is their lychee oolong - it not only have the fragrance, but also a rich flavour of lychee that blossoms in your mouth and leaves you with a uplifting after-taste.What I've found to be most pleasant is the attitude of the staff members, whose egos have not inflated after garnering the Michelin star. Quite the contrary, they were still caring and trying to improve in every aspect. This humility and eagerness to do better will go a long way.",

A few months ago I had dinner at Fratini La Trattoria which used to be ranked number 1 in tripadvisor and did not understand why. Summer Pavilion is so much better and deserves a higher ranking. I have also eaten at many expensive restaurants in China and I think Summer Pavilion is better than those restaurants.The best thing about this restaurant is that although many dishes on the menu are expensive, I am still able to feed my family of four big eaters for about SGD170. This is fantastic value compared to my dinner at Fratini which costs over SGD200 for 2. We ordered lots of dim sum, hor fun (flat white rice noodles), and chicken which are delicious and filling. I really liked the beef hor fun which is the best I have tasted anywhere. I also like the \"Marinated Farm Chicken, Chinese Herbs, Soya Sauce Smoked with Chinese Tea Leaves\" very much. I love chicken rice and have eaten at every famous chicken rice stall in Singapore, but this chicken at Summer Pavilion is the best ever. The chef is able to bring out the exquisite fragrance of chicken which is amazing. Half a chicken is very meaty and filling. However I also made the mistake of ordering the stuffed chicken wing and prawn salad which are tiny portions but very expensive. I also wish that the restaurant serves more variety of Hor Fun instead of only beef because their Hor Fun is really good. The restaurant is beautiful and service is excellent and very attentive. However the service staff kept speaking in mandarin to us even though they could hear that my family speaks in English. We are ethnic Chinese but as Singaporeans we grew up speaking in English. I wonder if it is because many service staff are from China. However the service staff treats us like royalty, even though we were dressed very casually just like normal Singaporeans do.I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, or if you only want to pamper yourself to a good meal.",

          "text": "\"Is there a special occasion?\" the person on the other line asked my husband when he called to reserve a table for two for dinner at Summer Pavilion, located at level 3 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. These are the \"Go that extra mile\" attitude that makes Summer Pavilion stands out from the rest of the Chinese restaurants.When we reached the restaurant, we were led to our table in the dimly-lit main dining hall. Our table overlooked the garden outside. The d\u00e9cor is very grand, modern chic and all the tables were lined with white table cloth, brown leather seats, exquisite blue China tableware and all the right utensils. I was carrying a big bag and without hesitation, the waitress brought another chair so that I can place my bag on the chair instead of putting it on the floor. From where I was seated, I could see beautiful black porcelain vases with feather motifs. We were told that the restaurant had undergone a major renovation and reopened only in November 2015.Our dinner voucher entitled us to redeem a \"Lily Dinner Set\", which is a 5-set dinner, amounting to s$88.00 per person (excludes Chinese Tea). Our waitress recommended a list of specialty tea which sounded \"foreign\" to us but as we were both down with cough, we asked for something soothing and she recommended a jar of warm water with lemon and honey.We were served yam crisps as a starter while we waited for the food to be served. We looked at the number of cutlery on our table and were baffled as we do not know which set of cutlery to use first. We laughed over our own silliness and lack of knowledge about fine dining. Our first course was \"Duo of Prawns\" which was very interesting as the prawns were cooked in two different ways. The peeled prawns were served chilled in a glass bowl with rocket leaves, cherries and blueberries while the prawn head and tail were deep-fried. It was an explosion of taste as we could really taste the natural sweetness of the prawns. Next was a bowl of braised bird's nest soup, with lobster meat, bamboo piths and dried asparagus. The broth is so flavourful with generous serving of bird nest. This thick bowl of goodness was exactly what we needed. It was a delightful, comforting soup that perked us up rightaway as we savoured every spoonful of it till the last drop.Our next dish was pan-fried sea perch served on top of green leafy vegetable. The fish was crisp on the outside and yet so juicy on the inside. Next is the braised rice with dried abalone, diced chicken, asparagus and a side dish of green vegetable and mushrooms. It was such a balanced dish and was very flavourful. The serving was just right.For dessert, we had a bowl of mango pudding with pomelo sacs, such a refreshing end to an excellent, delicious meal.Throughout the course of our dinner, we were very impressed by the attentive, courteous and impeccable service of the staff. Our tea-cup was topped up often and the tea pot was re-filled, without any prompting. The waitress also volunteered to take pictures of us as a couple when they saw that I was taking pictures of my husband. However, the dining hall was quite dim for photo-taking. We looked around us and the restaurant was actually doing brisk business. Some of the patrons were regular guests who had eaten in the restaurant before as we could see that they know what to order and were friendly to the staff.When we asked for our bill, we were pleasantly surprised when the friendly manager, Angel, told us that we do not have to pay a cent as the hot water was complimentary. If we had ordered tea or juices, there will be a cost.Besides ala-carte and set menus, Summer Pavilion also serves dim sum lunch daily but reservation is highly recommended to avoid disappointment. We really enjoyed our dinner at Summer Pavilion and agreed that this is a perfect place to bring our bosses and colleagues for a wonderful business lunch. While prices may be on the high-end, we felt that it is worth paying for high quality food and top-notch service and such an excellent dining experience is usually hard to come by.",

When we looked through the menu, we noticed the price for premium Chinese tea was S$12 - 15 per person. Hence, we asked the waitress whether there was any cheaper tea as we didint need a premium Chinese tea. But, we were told that the tea charge per person was S$12 in a very unfriendly tone. We were shocked as we couldn\u2019t recall any hotel (same rating as Marriott) actually charged more than ten dollars per person for a normal Chinese tea.When we proceeded to order our food, another waitress attended to us and we clarified again on the price of the tea. But, that waitress told us that there was normal tea which charges 5 dollars per person. This sounds more reasonable. Hence, we didn\u2019t know what went wrong and why we were given wrong information from previous waitress.Then, we asked for chilli padi to go with our food. Only upon our THIRD request, then the chilli padi was served. The restaurant didn\u2019t look so busy at that hour.Besides that, the food presentation was very disappointing given that this is a restaurant in a hotel. And the food quality is so so.To sum up, the dining experience with Wan Hao Marriott was a very disappointing one given the lousy service.I don\u2019t think that I will go back there again or even recommend any Friend to try. We can find a better food and service in other restaurant in other 5 stars hotel in Singapore for sure! P/s: I am not sure that we were treated this way because we were using the entertainer app.",

The sauce on the Iberico pork neck is a little too gluey though. (2) Enjoyed the dish very much save for too much residual water probably from not draining the water completely from the asparagus. It should be dry even with the XO sauce.(3) Very delicious. We loved that it was not oily at all and the bits and pieces of preserved meat were so fragrant.(4) It took 50 mins to arrive and that was after two reminders. The same captain that ignored me said it takes time to make the rice roll because it needs to be fried and then steamed but seriously 50 mins?The main dining hall was not full and I was not sure of the situation in the other areas.

However, he mentioned that Wan Hao's Peking Duck was undoubtedly the best! We were more adventurous and tried other unique dishes from Wan Hao's menu and was very pleased even though the dishes seemed a little ambitious. Aside from all the positives, the only negative was that the portion of fish from the Grouper fish with XO sauce (a dish) was too little.

I have continued to patronize this restaurant because I am a member of the Marriott club. I wanted to update the review because the standard of the food and the service has improved a lot since then. First the serving staff: Jenny the manager, May, Winnie and Marilyn the supervisors are all great people who treat their customers with care and consideration. Now the food: the sweet and sour pork which I raved about has got even better and is cooked with more consistent results than before. If you are a fan of sweet and sour pork as I am, you must try it. Over and above this dish I love their poached beef with Kailan. The Seafood or Fish Hor Fun ( flat rice noodles)with egg gravy is also very very good. They use a thinner version of Hor Fun almost like Ipoh Kway teow which is quite unique. The Orange pork ribs is also very good though a little on the fat side. There are also comfort dishes like the \"beef fried with Kailan which Brian and his team do extremely well. If beef is not your thing then you can have the same dish fried with prawns which is also great. I forgot to mention that they also have a new Dimsum chef and her prawn dumplings(har Gao) is really good. I also like her spicy wan ton and Lotus leaf glutinous rice.Lots of choices all well done.

I called up Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel in the early morning around 815am on 8 Jul 2017 and informed the call centre agent to leave a message to Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant to check on my receipt for my ordering under my reservation on 7 Jul 2017 whether I really ordered the additional abalone or the restaurant has overcharged me. I understand they will be opening at 1130am on Saturday and I leave a message to call centre agent to get the restaurant to call me as soon as possible to find out this issue so that I can have an answer for such billing.However, to my surprise, they didn't call me. I have requested the call centre agent to give me the email of F & B director for me to raise my concern through email at 3:40pm. After sending the email to F&B director - Daniel Burstein around 5pm, a female staff from the restaurant called me to explain this was their mistake for overcharging me at 7pm. I'm surprised that I can only receive call from the restaurant after I have sent the email it to their F&B Director - Daniel Burstein and before that the no one from Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant even bother to call me to explain to me.

Few more minutes later, this female staff called me again to explain that was a mistake and the restaurant can do a refund. I told her that I understand it was an overcharge for 1 abalone. But I need her to get the restaurant manager or management to explain to me how can this thing happen in Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza - Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant. There is no such thing that they can simply tell you they wrongly overcharge me and then tell me that they can do a refund to close this case. The problem here is, if I didn't even check again my receipt I won't know there is an additional abalone charged to my bills. So, if this is a standard of service for Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel to handle this kind of sensitive issue? I did check with a friend who also a regular guest in this restaurant, he told me that it is a must to check the receipts whenever dining in Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant as there is always an issue of accuracy or overcharged. If such issues keep happening in the restaurant, there is no one from management looks into how to improve the standard of services, this is really making me shocked. Even I have raised the concern on my receipts in the morning, there is no immediate actions taken by the restaurant manager to call me and explain as well as apologise to me as if this is a small issue and refund can settle this issue easily. I asked the restaurant manager Ms. Jenny Loh, what is the main reason for having such mistake in the restaurant especially this is related to money. She told me the staff who has overcharged me and has done the mistakes again. Yes, human makes mistake, but who is the in charge of this restaurant, who is the in charge of this hotel to allow this kind of mistakes keep happening in this restaurant. Ms. Jenny Loh offered to refund but she has to get my credit card info through phone to refund this overcharge. I ask her if this kind of issue happens on her, is she going to provide credit card info to the restaurant through phone ? She kept silent. She offered again to refund me but I need to go down restaurant to get the refund. I told her that the mistake was from the restaurant, why should I waste my time to go down the restaurant to get such refund. Then she finally offered to come to my place to do the refund. So, this is the trick, they don't know what is bespoke service supposed to be provided to the guest. They try their luck, if you can provide credit card info through phone, this is the best solution. If this is not feasible, they will ask u go down, if you don't bother to go down the restaurant to get refund then they will come to your place to do the refund to close this case. Is there anyone from this restaurant or this hotel know what does the customer service mean to the hotel?Till now, no one from the management calls me for a great explanation and great solution. I'm very disappointed that Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza has such management team to take care this Wan Hao Chinese restaurant. ",

The item i'm focusing on might sound like plain fare to those who visit the likes of Marriott but really, Wan Hao's seafood fried rice completely and overwhelmingly trashes its competitors in all departments. Some say that you can tell the skill of a chef by tasting his/her omelette. I believe the same case can be made of the humble fried rice in the chinese context.It sounds odd, but the rice itself was so springy yet soft, ridiculously fluffy yet firm. It's so good, even a paleo crack addict would have a go at it. It tastes so healthy, is so moist yet is without a trace of oil. The fragrance and flavour is subtle, unlike other interpretations which focus on delivering a formulaic overdose of taste. It makes for a perfect fit with the scallops, prawns, crab and traces of fish - all of which taste like they were hoisted straight out of the ocean. This is why this dish is so much better than its contemporaries. It's the taste of something pure at its very heart, a dedication to perfection in the fundamentals, and a rejection of taking the easy way out (something i'm guilty of)And i got to sit at a cosy wall-inset sofa table. Anyone would be happy. There are so many other dishes i've yet to try, but I'll definitely be back. Good job Wan Hao, i can't even help but spout so much nonsense hahaha",

Some Chinese restaurants fall off the mark over Chinese New Year but not this one.Some of our favourites from last night:1. chicken bak kwa yu sheng - no fish in this one but the thin slices of Bak Kwa (bbq chicken jerky) and deep fried fish skin were a nice touch to this dish. We wish this was on the regular menu.2. Kurobuto pork char siew - thinly sliced, tender and with a lovely flavour 3. home made tofu with spinach - a classic Cantonese dish that's well executed and delicious. They don't smother the tofu in gloopy sauce here so you can appreciate the crispy skin of the freshly deep fried egg tofu. The braised spinach was tasty and complimented the tofu nicely.4. Glutinous rice cooked with Chinese sausage in a lotus leaf - lots of thinly sliced Chinese sausage lend a sweet touch and lovely fragrance to this dish. 5. thinly sliced Nian kao with yam paste - this was deep fried like the traditional Szechuan red bean pancake. You can about 10 slices per order so this should definitely be shared. The single serving dessert dish of warm almond cream with tang yuan was of high quality - very smooth and not artificial tasting. This one is on the regular menu.Service was a little harried but sufficiently attentive.

Being from California, I had no idea that I was about to discover a most exquisite restaurant which offers not only the best dim sum, according to locals, but also offers vegetarian selections!What was most impressive was the location. Wan Hao is located on the 3rd floor of the Marriott Tang Hotel on Orchard Road. If you're just visiting Singapore, Orchard Road is usually where 4-5 star hotels are located as well as high-end luxury brand stores. As I walked into the restaurant, I was escorted in a beautiful booth with what seemed like gold silk shantung drapes with throw pillows encased in gold fabric. I had to wait for my friend so wanted to have a pot of tea. I asked the server what their clients usually order and he said Chrysanthemum tea so I gave that a try. It had a distinct and delicate woodsy taste, rather than floral. It took a bit of getting used to but every sip was quite elegant. My friend arrived and he pre-ordered some vegetarian dishes which was meticulously served one after another with their special sauces. It was heavenly! Even the very simple sauteed Chinese broccoli was divine! I cannot name each dim sum dish that was served but you can call in advance and ask them for their vegetarian offerings. Dining at Wan Hao is a celebration of the senses. You will truly enjoy the experience and you will be proud to invite guests to this restaurant and they will be truly impressed. For a party of 4, request for their booths. It will give you a feeling of privacy and dining in style.",

I have strongly recommended Wan Hao as the venue of our dinner party from my past good experience when dinning with Wan Hao.I must said that the quality of the foods was excellent, except for a few hiccups which I think I should bring to your kind attention.(1) There was only one table of guests in the dinning room assigned to us when we arrived. We were the second table and later on came in another third table of guests. So there were in total only three tables of guests.(2) The foods were served in a very fast pace as a result and then it halted for half an hour before the last disc of fried chicken was served. At first we had suspected one item was missing and asked for the waiter to check, but the answer from him was that all orders had been served. We asked again to check the order book and then he realised that one item was missing. That was the reason it took more than half an hour to serve the last item.(3) There was no change of plates despite we had ordered 7 discs of foods. We were almost forced to use the same plate for the seven discs, if it was not because of the big delay for the last item. The waiter only changed our plates after we have consumed the six discs, before waiting for half an hour for the final disc. I found this kind of service level unacceptable in your esteemed 5-starred hotel dinning. This was definitely not the Wan Hao that I used to know.(4) The quality of the chrysanthemum tea was far from satisfactory. Please take a good look of your tea leaves quality. It tasted like plain hot water.(5) When we asked for the complementary parking after the dinner, we were told that only one free parking per $150 spent. We were short of $3.40 to have entitled to the second car (please refer to the attached bill). Why this rigid regimental rule? Does it mean that if I have come alone and dined for less than $150, I would not be given a free parking treatment by your esteemed hotel?",

You get to taste the freshness of the food and all are prepared when you order, not those overly steamed or cooked type. The only drawback is that they only serve dim sum for lunch. So dinner will be an entirely different set of menu, which I feel that the standard of food is slightly different. Say, I would rate the dim sum 9.8/10 and dinner 6/10. I tried their dinner once and the food were kind of mediocre. The crispy chicken was hard and dry, the beef horfun was a little too oily...

The Dim sum came in 2 pieces, which was rather pricey and not enough to share. Of course they use good quality ingredients and we pay for the ambience. I like the custard bun which was one of the best I've had. The Soup was very yummy and nourishing too.

We ordered 4 dishes - Spanish Pork Char Siew (because the suckling pig we originally ordered was sold out), Three Eggs with Spinach in Broth, Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Pork. The first disappointment was being told the suckling pig was sold out. Next we were told the Chinese spinach typically used in the Three Eggs Spinach Dish is also out. Can the kitchen replace with another type of spinach. We said ok else we would have went elsewhere for dinner at that point...When I am told Spanish pork, I am thinking Iberico pork which should be fragrant and juicy. The pork char siew was served in long, thin slices, quite different from how other restaurants would slice their char siew. The char siew looks gleaming and tastes sweet. The shortfall is that out of the plate of few slices, only two slices were meat. The rest were either high in fats or all fats. Not melt in the mouth kind of ooey fat but the can't bite through kind of fat. We didn't finish this dish.The three egg spinach was very average. I kinda thought the three types of eggs would blend with the vegetable and soup harmoniously, or at least that is my limited understanding of the dish. The one served was like looking at three strangers placed together in a plate. It didn't help this type of spinach doesn't absorb much of the goodness from the soup stock.The sweet and sour pork was decent. The meat does not taste frozen, which is a relief. It was tender and well fried. The sauce is probably a higher class sweet and sour blend. Its more brown than red and tastes more of hawthorn/plum, I am not sure. Not really my cup of tea. The fried rice was probably the best dish. The rice grains were coated with a thin film of oil which is how good fried rice should be. The two improvements I would say is not to overcook the seafood and use a better grade of rice. This one no matter how good the frying, was unable to release the full fragrance. I guess I had expected much more from a high-end restaurant especially in simple dishes like these. Perhaps I will return some day to try the dim sum which seems to have a strong fusion flavour and possibly a specialty of the chef.",

They were show-stoppers. Beauties of exquisite shine and colour. Tempted by their catwalk perfection, we ordered 4 cakes to share between the 2 of us. Yikes, we came away feeling like we had just eaten a mishmash of cream, icing and sponge. None of the flavours left any impression. The adornments on the cakes tasted almost plastic too. It was all quite shocking from such a highly regarded patisserie. The cakes lacked any originality, apart from their appearance. Sadly they all fell short of impressing our taste-buds. Although we still left in total awe of their beauty, each cake was either too bland or fell flat texturally. Mind you, I did ask for their most interesting cake that would offer up an interesting textural experience. Note to self, if service is cold, don't ever ask for recommendations.

But anyway \u2013 since they do serve dinner, and I had it, let me review the dinner itself.The menu is weird. i mean, serioulsy mis-matched. Some of the dishes are traditional french (which is expected), but then there's Nasi Lemak Burger also. Now, there are many places to go for Nasi Lemak, or even Nasi Lemak Burger in Singapore. I highly doubt that Antoinette is the place anyone would fo to for that.We ordered the Entrec\u00f4te and Carbonara. The carbonara arrived a good ten minutes before the steak. Please note that i son't say \"Spaghetti Carbonara\" or \"pasta\" \u2013 it was nether. The carbonara was made with small rolls of chewy pastry. Weird. It came with a cream sauce (as opposed to just cheese and egg) and regular bacon (not guanciale or even pancetta), and a poached egg on top (which made it look rather fancy). The flavour was surprisingly bland, and the cream made it too rich. I know many make it with cream, but it's best (and more authentic) without.The Entrec\u00f4te (ribeye), was the thinnest steak I've ever seen. It was poorly cooked (too cold pan), making it both overcooked inside and grey on the outside at the same time. Served with one of the worst mashed potatoes I've ever had, a very bland sauce, and slightly old ruccola. Service was not great, nothing was delivered with a smile, no one checked on our food, and it was just a bad experience altogether.I think the chef has left the building a long time ago, and is just phoning it in at this point. The food is a let-down, and certainly does not represent value for money. The service is half-hearted and inexperienced, and the ambience feels dated. The cake was ok, but that's basically the only reason to bring it up from one to to stars.",

Antoinette is supposed to be a French eatery with an Asian twist, but the menu also includes some Italian fare, so it would be more accurate to say it serves European-Asian fusion cuisine. I thought the one-for-one deal sounded promising until I read a few of the reviews - some of the comments were enough to cause me some concern. Afterall, I really wanted both of us to enjoy the dinner. Before we ordered, the staff repeatedly assured us that the food would be sufficient for the value-for-money one-for-one deal. And they were right. Not only were the portions all right, they were delicious! We ordered each of the following and had a good time sharing:Starter: Antoinette\u2019s Mushroom Soup (small bowl of authentic mushroom soup but it was deliciously rich)Starter: Duck Rilette with wild mushrooms and poached eggs (quite good)Main: Omelette with red wine beef ragout and butter pilaf rice (tasty, with all the elements working well together, and surprisingly filling because of the pilaf rice)Main: Chili crab tagliatelle (my friend from Seoul really liked it!) The dessert was the chef\u2019s choice: white chocolate coffee cake. It was yummy, with just the right texture and balance of sweetness. (Afterall, Antoinette is better known for its cakes and desserts, thanks to Singaporean pastry chef Pang Kok Keong). The one-for-one dinner cost SGD50++, just under SGD60 (USD46/\u00a332/\u00a54,992/48,857 KRW). Tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s bien! That\u2019s really reasonably priced for a three-course dinner for two ladies at the Mandarin Gallery, smack in the middle of Orchard Road!

The eggs were way too watery and undercooked (and the eggs looked like they poached them by tying them in plastic bags and dropping them in hot water). Honestly, I could have done a better job cooking this dish myself. But I suppose I have only myself to blame since that's technically all the ingredients listed on the menu. The cakes look better than they taste, unless you're a fan of milk chocolate. I got the Royale which was supposed to be dark chocolate but honestly tastes more like milk chocolate.Service really depends on which waitress you get.

Oh yeah and I had a dirty knife at the start (before I ordered) which I asked her to change for me, and amazingly, she walked out of sight and after a while came back with the exact same knife!!?? I had to point out to her the unwashed piece of food on the knife from the last guest that used it before she actually changed it for me, and that took her about 10min AFTER my food came. She also forgot our order 3 times (how did that even happen) but that's the least of her flaws.That aside, I'm giving this one more star than what I thought it deserved because funnily enough, the restaurant gave me one more egg for my meal because apparently they forgot one egg (there's supposed to be 2 eggs in the dish but they gave me only one). So kudos to them for their honesty.",

Staffs were friendly. They suggested some of their best-selling desserts and teas.However, my friend and I were interested of their beautifully hand crafted cakes.We ordered:-Summer Petit: Raspberry mousse with pistachio bavarois, forrest berries jelly; pistachio sponge and glaze-Mont Blanc (Mont-Blanc Aux Marrons): a dessert of pur\u00e9ed, sweetened chestnuts topped with whipped cream (My fav, as the sweetness is just nice- very light compared to other Mont Blanc)-Rose Chinois Tea (a must try)-Iced Elder Flower Strawberry Tea (Refreshingly good)Antoinette's french desserts and organic teas were amazing! Their hand crafted desserts and cakes were definitely an Instagram worthy, gorgeously appealing with an exquisite taste.",

It had a lovely texture on the outside, like a crusty chiffon kind of combination. The sweet-sour flavor of the fruits blended right in, bringing the pastry to a new height -it tasted as good as it looks. Next, the famous Strawberry Shortcake (around SGD$9.00) - velvety smooth and cotton soft, with the most aromatic strawberry flavor in its cream-dream layers. There were also real fruits tucked between the layers, making this cake an enjoyment in texture and flavor. Finally, the Le Royale cake (SGD$8.00) - layers of dark chocolate mousse, crunchy hazelnut feutille and almond meringue - on a pulp soft sponge cake.

I thought it was beautifully done, very luxurious and French themed. Perhaps they were in a different Antoinette (there are a few around Singapore) and mistakenly reviewed it under the wrong one? I was shown to a beautiful armchair - absolutely terrific comfort. I was offered high tea at a cost of $30 which is very reasonable by Australian prices. However, I just wanted one piece of cake so had a strawberry sponge and a hot chocolate (see pictures). In Singapore they don't seem to offer a choice of HC - milk or dark or flavours. The Hot chocolate I received was dark and not very sweet but it was very strong and good quality, so thick it was almost like drinking melted chocolate! Served in beautiful china too. The cake was very good. Very light and moist sponge, very fresh cream and strawberries, freshly made. Cost was about $18 SGD if I recall correctly, so about $15 AUD including taxes (everything is taxed there). They do not serve lunch after 3pm but I only wanted tea anyway.

The Gnocchi which were lightly pan-fried, giving a crisp outer layer and soft center.My brother had the the Classic Eggs Florentine ($14) which was served on toasted brioche with Serrano ham and Hollandaise sauce.

For dessert we ordered the signature Antoinette cake and the Strawberry shortcake.My brother became a fan of the Strawberry Shortcake.

Further, while our orders--French Onion soup, Nordic Crepe with Smoked salmon, and French Toast-- arrived promptly, we quickly wished they had not come at all. The French Onion soup, with strange cheese hat and vinegary broth, could not have tasted worse had it come from a can. Three spoons was more then enough of this soggy bread ladened mess. The Nordic crepe, which we returned to kitchen after one bite, contained salmon which tasted as though it had gone off earlier in the week. The crepe was as crispy as a taco shell, and bore no similarity to a real crepe. Interestingly, the staff charged us full price, over our objections, for this item because we had tasted it, as if there was some other way to know that it was bad. The French Toast, while eatable at least, was only passable. Needless to say, we left our food largely untouched, and went in search of good food elsewhere.

For full review : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/01/antoinette-four-musketeers.htmlOne can tell from the name Kyoto that this is a Japanese inspired cake made of matcha mousse, chestnut creameux and matcha sponge. This does not taste sweet despite the presence of chestnut and the green tea powder used is likely to be authentic for it had a mild bitter aftertaste.I love this Gula Melaka Tart out of the four as the taste and textures is like a haphazard mess but in a good way. The bright yellow exotique coulis on top burst out that sour passionfruit lava which cuts the coconut mousse but hits head on into the next layer of gula melaka cremeux, finger sponge with gula melaka. I have also under-estimated the tart shell which survived the weight of the mousse by maintaining its crispness.The Chloe is made up of yuzu cream and enrobed in white chocolate mousse with a light sponge cake on a crumbly thin almond biscuit. Unlike most yuzu cakes, the generous amount of yuzu centre gives a tartness that balances of the extremely sweet and milky white chocolate. The base is flat one here.The Forbidden Fruit inspired from the Adam and Eve story, is made up green apple mousse, green apple jelly, maple cream with chunks of vanilla scented caramelised apples on a sweet financier cake base. The combination of maple and apple is refreshingly light and the flavours did not clash or overwhelm the other.I hope that these four will stay for good while the older versions can be replaced with new exciting flavours so that the Singapore pastry scene can match up with the rest of the world.

And no, it's not one of those swanky places where you can see the chef prepare sushi, it's a dump with service staff shouting at kitchen staff at the top of their lungs through an open door, with crates and bins stacked everywhere..(3) Service is awful. We waited for ages to get a menu, for ages again to order, for ages again to get anything to eat/drink (and not in the right order either). Remember, they only have 7 tables to cater for. In line with the temperature, service is frosty when not contemptuous. (4) Despite being as overpriced as all French restaurants in Singapore, the food is very average. I guess it gets cold virtually instantly thanks to the air-con but that's not an excuse and it's also not the only disappointment.(5) If a bread basket includes pastry types A, B and C, that's what it will include. It is \"absolutely impossible\" to get say, A, A and C. I know I sound like a snob for complaining about this, but come on: it's a basket of pastries, not some secret-recipe truffle oil sauce! Note that this would never happen at Laduree. (6) Everything is a copy of Laduree's design. Even the logo on the menu and the macaroons. That's insulting to the ambiance, decor, service, and food quality you find at the French chain and that are all sorely lacking here.",

We don't care for great service when dining out or shopping. We rather let the products and offerings speak for themselves. At Antoinette, the service was so ice-cold and non-existent, we almost felt tempted to walk out the front door without paying as we couldn't get anyone's attention. LOLAlas, let's move on to the main matter at hand, their offerings of cake and drinks. The coffees and tea we ordered were decent. However, what brought us here were the cakes! They were show-stoppers. Beauties of exquisite shine and colour. Tempted by their catwalk perfection, we ordered 4 cakes to share between the 2 of us. Yikes, we came away feeling like we had just eaten a mishmash of cream, icing and sponge. None of the flavours left any impression. The adornments on the cakes tasted almost plastic too. It was all quite shocking from such a highly regarded patisserie. The cakes lacked any originality, apart from their appearance. Sadly they all fell short of impressing our taste-buds. Although we still left in total awe of their beauty, each cake was either too bland or fell flat texturally. Mind you, I did ask for their most interesting cake that would offer up an interesting textural experience. Note to self, if service is cold, don't ever ask for recommendations. Perhaps we chose the \"wrong\" cakes to judge Antoinette by at this time but 4 out of 4?!?! Sigh.... then of course, the service, or the lack of it. Guys, get your act together please.",

But anyway \u2013 since they do serve dinner, and I had it, let me review the dinner itself.The menu is weird. i mean, serioulsy mis-matched. Some of the dishes are traditional french (which is expected), but then there's Nasi Lemak Burger also. Now, there are many places to go for Nasi Lemak, or even Nasi Lemak Burger in Singapore. I highly doubt that Antoinette is the place anyone would fo to for that.We ordered the Entrec\u00f4te and Carbonara. The carbonara arrived a good ten minutes before the steak. Please note that i son't say \"Spaghetti Carbonara\" or \"pasta\" \u2013 it was nether. The carbonara was made with small rolls of chewy pastry. Weird. It came with a cream sauce (as opposed to just cheese and egg) and regular bacon (not guanciale or even pancetta), and a poached egg on top (which made it look rather fancy). The flavour was surprisingly bland, and the cream made it too rich. I know many make it with cream, but it's best (and more authentic) without.The Entrec\u00f4te (ribeye), was the thinnest steak I've ever seen. It was poorly cooked (too cold pan), making it both overcooked inside and grey on the outside at the same time. Served with one of the worst mashed potatoes I've ever had, a very bland sauce, and slightly old ruccola. Service was not great, nothing was delivered with a smile, no one checked on our food, and it was just a bad experience altogether.I think the chef has left the building a long time ago, and is just phoning it in at this point. The food is a let-down, and certainly does not represent value for money. The service is half-hearted and inexperienced, and the ambience feels dated. The cake was ok, but that's basically the only reason to bring it up from one to to stars.",

However, perhaps I'm not a fan of creamy sauces thus I find it kind of overwhelming and 'jelat' towards finishing it up. There are 2 types of sauces to choose from but I strongly recommend the original creamy sauce because the other cranberry sauce doesn't go well in terms of aesthetical and flavor aspect. As for the salad, its olive oil dressing is kind of overdosing a little as I do find them a bit oily in my mouth but the feta cheese blends smoothly with the cucumber and tomatoes. Dessert wise, I will have to say they are on average. Should I happen to be there anytime with my friends again, I'll definately order only the poulet.",

Their signature whole chicken with the creamy sauce was excellent, the braised pork belly was equally delicious and well cooked. The mushroom cappuccino was robust BUT the escargots were disappointing & we couldn't finish them. We brought this to the attention of the manager and after awhile he returned and agreed that they were not up to standard. He made good by offering us one free dessert and that was most delightful - the tiramisu served in a glass jar was very very good (sans alcohol). Only other niggling point was that they didn't serve tap water but they did offer a bottle of mineral water.The outlet manager had excellent customer service attributes and despite the escargots and tap water, we will definitely return and recommend this value for money outlet to all our friends!",

The cream sauce that served with the chicken is just nice, it's neither too thick nor it's too watery. Mashed potatoes is one of the favourite side dish in the menu. In my opinion the mashed potatoes is really smooth and creamy, however, I'd like to suggest you to order this for share. It is too much for a single person to finish it.The only thing that I dislike about Poulet is the desserts. We've tried 2 desserts in the menu, the profiteroles and the soy pudding. Both are just okay, nothing to shout about, hence, I feel it's charging too much for this quality.The other branch that I will recommend will be Poulet in Raffles City.

Food: Ordered Roast chicken with red wine sauce, country mushroom soup and oxtail potato gatin. Roast chicken took more than 20 mins to come despite there are only 2 tables in the restaurant and we are the only table not served any food or drinks. Chicken is kind of dry and red wine sauce doesn't taste good. Country mushroom and oxtail potato are reasonable. Service: Slow to respond, no one bothered to clear our finished food. Basically, only restaurant supervisor is really working. Dessert: Tried their tiramisu, was disappointed. Only the menu pix look good. Drinks: Drinks are quite expensive.

We chose to share a whole roast chicken - their signature dish, which they call poulet roti. It certainly wasn't worth anything near the S$28++ they charge. While the cooking was acceptable, although possibly slightly underdone, the chicken itself was of battery-hen quality, and tasteless. We asked for what they described as a baguette to go with it - but it turned out not to be a loaf of French bread but instead just four thin slices of toast, each no more than a few square centimetres. The drinks were similarly expensive - and even glasses of warm water were priced at 50 cents each. But the poor quality of the food and the inflated prices are not the main complaint. The service was outright nasty. We were treated in an offhand manner from the start, the waitress making no explanation of what was on offer. When the food arrived we asked for extra napkins, so she brought us a plate. We asked for mustard; but she had evidently never heard of such stuff, although she managed to bring some after going off to ask for advice from colleagues. Then - oops! - I upset a glass of Coca-cola, drenching the table and seats and soaking my trousers. There was no one around to help, so I stood and up shouted out; when nothing happened I shouted louder - \"someone, anyone, bring a cloth!\" The waitress was standing at a nearby table, chatting. I shouted louder, my wife stood up and shouted, and customers at other tables stared at us. The kitchen staff stopped work and stared at us, but the waitress stayed in her position, still chatting. Eventually, after what seemed like an age, but was probably less than a minute, the manager came over, helped clean up and took us to a fresh table. He didn't seem surprised when I said I wasn't going to pay the 10 per cent service charge.",

My wife had the seafood curry (which looked more like a muffin when it came out), flavour ok but no spice. I had the sizzling beef which was underdone, not a lot of flavour and accompanied by some onions and tomato that was basically just mush. Asked for some fish oil and chilli for the curry, the waiter had no idea. Just nodded and served the table next door (in fact we had to hail him down whenever we wanted anything), stopped the lady waiter and she told us there was no fish sauce (in Asian food??) and by the time the chilli came out it was all stone cold.Had two margaritas and two very average glasses of chardonnay and the bill was $200.Equating quality of food and how poor the service was at that price point I can only say it is below average. If it had been all of that and somewhat cheaper I may have said average.By all means go to see the view but don't expect too much.",

The flavours were plentiful and balanced. The drinks weren't about how much alcohol they could cram in or how much they could scrimp but rather focused on the flavours. Even the coffee was perfect. I've seen some fairly negative reviews sprinkled in here. I am extremely hard to please and impress. Those complaining on the price of drinks may not be familiar with Singapore being more expensive on the alcohol front, or that if they did not charge an entry fee they'd be swarmed and overwhelmed with people wanting the view just like 'the boat' had and now also charges for people to go up. It's an attraction! You pay to walk among the trees. How is the SuperTree any different? I really feel the negative reviews have come from tourists who have yet to understand the area and Singapore in general. At $20 which includes a drink for the view and tentative staff, you can't complain. We weren't given plastic cups either. It was all glass. SuperTree is now on our list for Thailand and we will probably stay at the resort. ",

We knew we would be assured of spectacular view towards the Singapore River and the city; towards the awe-inspiring Marina Bay Sands Hotel; and towards the sea where illuminated ships sat majestically in the habour and at the new cruise terminal.The restaurant itself was not much to look at. The table settings were quite nice, but the walls looked like a stage that was not properly dressed. I feel that a restaurant with a minimum cover charge of SGD $80++ (\u00a345.00++) per head should rather more elegant, albeit the views outside are spectacular and there is a balcony surrounding the restaurant where we had pre-dinner drinks as the sun set, which is a lovely touch.The service was very attentive and the waitress was helpful in assisting us to order. We perhaps should have been a little less trusting, however, as her much praised choice of soft shell crabs was not much to write home about. The crabs were dry and the thick sauce they were served atop was really too rich and creamy.Our selection of starters for two people were really nice and consisted of several tasty bite-sized foods including Vietnamese rice paper wraps and spicy squid.A main course dish of lemongrass cod was very food. It was fresh, flaky and the taste was very good We did not have dessert, but instead took coffee upstairs on the outside rooftop bar where there was a lovely breeze, a romantic air and, once again, breathtaking views. It was a pleasant experience and the food was good, but I think the prices are rather reflective of the location and views rather than of the food.

So it's a wonderful spot and affords great views of the gardens and of Singapore.It costs 20 $ to go up to the bar and for that you get one drink (small beer, small wine or single spirit with mixer. So far so good.The staff however are less than friendly and there seems little motivation to serve you at all. The music is one of the worst pieces of elevator music you have ever heard with some woman simply destroying as many well known favourite tunes as it is possible to cram into a CD. We were enjoying our drink and had time to kill before the light show so we decided to order a second drink. That was an achievement since it involved engaging the staff who seemed pretty uninterested in serving us or anyone else for that matter. Amazingly the second drink turned out to be 10% more expensive than the one we paid for as part of our entrance to the bar! It would have been cheaper to travel down in the lift and simply buy a second wristband!Shame rally as this should be one of the great places to enjoy a drink in SP but the shine is taken off it by poor management that obviously does not value the customer experience for highly",

They say that this restaurant offers 'the best view of the gardens', well I beg to differ, the view is obstructed by the metal frame of the supertree, the view is much better from the walking platform between supertrees, or even just from the ground walking around the supertree grove, i found the view to be a massive disappointment, especially as that was one of the main reasons we booked to eat here. So, in summary, the food is great but expensive, and the service we received was lower than I would expect when paying this price, you can get just as good and better service for a similar price but with much better views at places like Equinox or Level 33, so unfortunately I will not be going back.",

The second issue was really quite laughable. Having selected a slice of matcha cheesecake as dessert, one of us had stepped aside to inform the waitress that it was a birthday celebration, and if a candle could be provided along with the dessert.

The greatest irony was that the waiter actually realised that it was a mistake, and looked sheepish as he set it down on our table, and proceeded to scamper off immediately as if to avoid us noticing. We called him back to clarify the situation and he admitted that it was a mistake. At this point, we found it extremely unbecoming, that a MISTAKE was knowingly served to guests. We can only guess that there were probably multiple stages of miscommunication between the first wait staff who took the message from us, the person who prepared the dessert, and the last person to actually serve it to our table. And that if a mistake was genuine, perhaps a word of clarification or apology could be offered to the guests in advance, and we could have just laughed off the whole incident. After sending it back, we had the word \"candle\" unceremoniously erased from the plate, and the same dish re-served to us, except with the scoop of chocolate ice-cream half melted by this time.

Not particularly friendly, but reliableThe food is quite focused on seafood and was generally alright, with hits and misses:- my soup was hardly warm- the brown rice was room temperature and blandIn the end, we ordered well more than the minimal spend required, and thought we could have had 2 excellent dinners for the price of this one in other nice places. It was still an overall enjoyable evening given the occasion and company though...So all in all, our children are now happy to know what is up in the Supertrees of the Gardens by the Bay, but we won't be coming back anytime soon.",

The second way is to take taxi and alight at the taxi stand, in front of the Visitor Center of the the Gardens. Then it would take less than 10 mins to walk to the restaurant. I used this latter way and yes, it's quite easy and fast to get to the restaurant. From the taxi stand, walk towards the Visitor Center and look for signboards pointing to Supertree Grove.The Supertree Grove is the tallest 'tree' in the Gardens so you can't miss it.The lift to the top floor restaurant is rather slow so you will have to wait a long while if there are many customers.Restaurant itself is nicely decored.All tables are lined up against the windows so that is nice. However, because of the many metal structures all over the Supertree, actually visibility to outside view isn't very fantastic at night. Just darkness and lightings.Service here isn't good. The waitress who showed us to our table and took our drinks and appetizer order wasn't seen much around our table section thereafter. We had to be on the lookout for anyone to catch their attention to take down our mains and dessert orders. Waiter and waitress were somewhat polite but not easily found. Instructions isn't very clear from the waiter too. I'd asked him about the lights show and he couldn't tell us clearly where it would happen. Basically he should have just told us to walk on the balcony area at 8.45pm and the lights are found on the supertrees.Instead, he only said - \"8.45pm\" and \"can see from inside restaurant.\"We ordered a seafood platter as starter, followed by our mains and then dessert.The seafood platter had : prawns, mussels, oysters, scallops and sashimi salmon. Fresh and nice.For the mains, I chose the hotplate prime beef. My colleagues had hotplates too - wagyu and pork. This beef hotplate is my favourite dish - well seasoned, tender and juicy.Dessert was the most disappointing dish. I had the matcha cheese cake with ice cream. The cheese cake tasted like agar agar. No cheese taste and not much matcha taste.Here, each guest must be committed to spend about S$80++. This meal for 4 of us costed nearly S$490.Not cheap but then again, that's the price at this Marina Bay Sands area so I won't complain much. The restaurants at Marina Bay Sands top floor will cost minimally S$200 per person.So my biggest grouse for this restaurant - food is not very asean like; service is not good at all and lastly, not all dishes are good.I'll only come back here again if I'm hosting overseas guests, just for the ambience.",

The top bar was nicely set out but wouldn't be viable in bad weather.We were there at around 3:30pm, at that time we had the option of taking our dink on the rooftop bar, inside next to the restaurant it just outside on the walkway surrounding, there was only about 16-20 people there - when the place is full I'd imagine that choices might be a bit more limited.We decided to have a late lunch there which was no problem. Because we were classified as lunch dinners (or just dinners outside dinner) there was no minimum spend. At dinner it's clearly stated there is an 80S$ minimum per person. We may not have stayed if this applied to our sitting.We ended up having a platter (classified as for 4 people, but it was customized for the 2 of us). The food came out pretty quickly and was delicious. We found staff courteous and pleasant.I'd happily recommend SuperTree restaurant to anyone - outside dinner where there is an enforced minimum spend.The experience was unique, with great views, great views and pleasant staff.",

For example; just say that during special evenings the prices are increased with say 30%. We would have been much more ok with an approach like that.

The view from the top of the SuperTree is stunning as it is a 360% open bar area with views to the sea, CBD, Marina Bay Sands and East Coast. It is not as high as MBS so you get a different perspective and the chance to look back at MBS (not the usual Marina Bay View). I recommend going at sunset to see the city slowing move into night and the lights of the city come to the fore. A breeze in the evening makes it perfect. So arrive at say 6:30pm, leave at 7:45pm just in time for the light show at Gardens By the Bay just outside the SuperTree on ground level.

A great big man-made structure that resembles a metal tree. We go toward the entrance, its a bit like a lighthouse; theres a small door at the foot. There is a concierge there to check our reservation. The place is lit up like a christmas tree - all green and blue neon coming from these weird slightly tacky looking lights. But we know its an Indochine restaurant so we're not worried yet. They're all classy and stylish right? Wrong. So after the concierge confirmed our reservation, and sends us upstairs. We walk thru the entrance, and into the Supertree itself; a shabby corridor filled with what looks like cheap bric-a-brac for sale at ridiculous prices. No one's actually in there, its just a passage to the lift which someone saw fit to fill with rubbish - literally: there were a few bags of garbage by the fire exit, and some builders stuff. We go up the lift. When we come out, there is another concierge - who inexplicably, checks our reservation again. Maybe because we managed to lie our way past the first concierge? Then we're shown to our seat...they walk us by the bar, and the first thing we notice is the green neon LED lights behind the bar - and we're not talking fancy fibre optics or something artistic; its basically the stuff you see at Bangkok night markets. I can buy in Sim Lim for 10 bucks. Then we notice the christmas lights. Yes, Christmas lights. Great big clusters of them, cheap and tacky balls of plastic hanging all over the place. Then we notice the green astroturf they've used as a kind of wallpaper. Then we notice that all of this serves to cause glare on the windows, so you can't actually see outside the spectacular view of Singapore skyline, we just see a reflection of garish christmas lights. Then we see our zebra/cowpat mohair seat, and the disco ball hanging from the ceiling directly above us. In short, it feels like a cheap and tacky restaurant you'd find attached to a hostel in Kuta - nothing at all like the other Indochine restaurants.The staff at least have the good grace to look embarrassed about it all, I mean, would you be happy about working a 10hr shift in there? I really felt for them...service wasn't good, but I didn't have the heart to hold it against them. I'd be sour if I had to work there too. The worst part of all this is that the food is actually excellent. (Indochine have several restaurants in Singapore; incidentally, my old boss took my wife and I to the Empress Place branch in 2010 when pitching the idea of permanently relocating to Singapore, and it sealed the deal - it was that good)So we sat down, ordered a couple of cocktails and some spring rolls, looked at the mains menu & wine list...we did the math; staring down the barrel of a $300+ meal for two all-in....after a couple of nibbles and sips and consideration, we decided to quit while we were ahead. Just paid for the cocktails / rolls, walked out, and got some street food. Reading the other reviews, it was definitely the smart play. With so many awesome restaurants in SG around this price range, paying $150 a head for anything that isn't a 100% on-point experience seems silly - you can eat at Wolfgang Puck, Senso or Pollen for that...I really hope they get it together and step up the offering (or lower their prices!).

How about feasting a menu designed on organice high quality produce but to also provides you with healthy additives? If you answered yes partly or wholly to anything above then supertree by indochine is definately an experience you need to put on your checklist of things to do in singapore!!! We stayed at Marina bay sands and was just a quick 10min stroll through the gardens. We were having dinner with family booked by my uncle. Upon arrival downstairs we were greated by a lovely hostess who put down her phone immediately to direct us how to get up the supertree. The foyer had cultural items displayed on display for you to view while waiting for the lift to arrive to beam you up to level 1 which is 40 metres high or so. Once the lift doors opened we were welcomed by 2 smiling staff who took us to the table. While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive we had asahi beer on tap and was informed we were able to go to the roof top while waiting for other guests. They did have a extensive beverage menu but had to saw no due to a 1am flight. And OMG, the rooftop was a sight to behold. The rooftop incapsulated singapore in a 360 degree view setting and is worth the entry fee to come up to the rooftop just to immense yourself in picture perfext views even if you are not dinning in the resturant. The rooftop had a bar and able to order finger food and some other meals. Finally when other guests arrived, we returned to the table and the food was ordered. I just want to point out the timing of each entree and main meal was superb. From when the share entree platter came to the salman larb, you never felt as if you were waiting nor overwhelmed with food. Below are the results you have all been hungrily drooling for: Super tree share platter 8/10 *The lychee beignet rolls on a spoon with a splash of the dipping sauce was heavenly and 100% the highlight. The rice cake rolls, prawn rolls, and grilled squid was high in quality but wished the chef could a little bit more spin to it. For example having the squid marinate in the lime chilli sauce instead of grilling it naked to then dip into sauce.Salmon raw carpaccio (Larb) 9.5/10*Traditional flavours of larb using high quality salmon, what else can i say? Every bite was as luxurious as the first and the fat ratio of the salmon used had to be picked from the heavens above.Only wish if there was a little bit more of seasame seed for extra texture and crunchPapaya Salad 9/10*Hands down one of the best papaya salad i have ever eaten in a fusion or modern asian resturant. The spice to dressing ratio was spot on with the amount of dried shrimps used which gave a balanced and fresh taste everytime you took a mouthful of the salad. The papaya was crunchy and slightly tangy which is a great sign of freshness and quality in there kitchenWild Atlantic lobster with EE-FU noodles 9/10*This dish would have to be my value pick of the menu. Even though i did pay for the bill i still really wanted to know the cost of this traditional mouth watering dish. SG$68 (AUD$60) for a full lobster (350g - 400g size or so) on a massive bed of soft stir fried noodles cooked with a recipe that took me back to hongkong. This hands down would have cost AUD$100 - $150 average in most modern asian resturants in Australia. The lobster was cooked to perfect timing to still retain its natural juices and not drying out accompanied with the noodles which still had spring in every bite and coated with a traditional inspired stir fry sauce which made eat the noodles with nealry every other dish just to try to come up with some crazy combination.45 day grainfed lemongrass lamb rack 10/10*To me this was the holy grail of the menu. The one dish that i recommend you have try to understand what modern asian fusion is in this day and age. From the asian marinating of lemon grass to the asian inspired sweet and sour Jus to then be plated with truffle dressed potato beignet was a sight i will cherish for a very long time. Then when you cut a piece of lamb dipped in the Jus then chase it with the potato beignet which had been showered by the truffle cream was just a explosion of flavour.Whole snapper crispy fillet 7.5/10*high quaility produce used to produce your usual high standard dish which is on 80% of modern asian menus. Great crunch from the mango salad and when paired with the snapper dipped in fish sauce, it gave a extra dimension of texture to deliver a well rounded dish. This was the last dish to arrive and i actually had my expectations set really high for this dish escpecially after the lamb rack and was hoping that there would be a unique element. I wish the chef cound have added more spices in the coating before frying such as five spice, pepper or even onion powder and spice powder with pepper to give it a extra zing. But hey, im no chef :)Overall food experience is 9/10Overall restaurant experience 10/10Overall service experience 9/10Overall this needs to be on your to do list in singapore I recommend going around 6pm so you can experience the sunset views and also the spectacular night views on the rooftop. No other resturant in singapore can provide a 360 degree paranomic views of singapore from the gardens to the bay hence 10/10 for restaurant experience. They always had a smile and always made sure your glass was full with whatever alcohol or water you may had ordered.Also forgot to mention the free nightly entertainment all the surrounding trees put on at 730pm which you can enjoy on the rooftop with a cocktail or below with the crowds, lazily laying on the floor after a unforgettable flavour journey Indochine has just taken you on there unique flagship restaurant, Supertree. Yours flavourly,TFT - The Fatty Tourist",

First the decor is horrific with the theme probably something to do with Qing dynasty china. Although some (perhaps the omnipresent Chinese tourists) will find that interesting, it is actually quite uncomfortable and distracting if you are looking for a quiet dinner. At the top of the super tree one would expect a great view but it is totally obscured by the rings of metallic supporting structures. The food was average; the menu offers many vegetarian options but their idea of making a non vegetarian item is by omission and not substitution. There is no culinary innovation and they still charge you the same price when they remove the prawns from a pomelo and prawn salad. The saving grace was the rooftop bar which offers a panoramic view but is very crowded.I will not return to this place anytime soon. ",

However, if you do sit on that side, you will struggle not to wish that you were up there instead.This place needs to work out what it wants to be. Does it want to offer table service, or a walk up bar service. At the moment, there is no system, it is horribly unprofessional, and the staff are either incompetent, or confused (or both). The entry fee of S$18 gets you one drink of house wine or a spirit. Given the limited choice of drinks, and the fact that there were maybe 20 people up there, and 5 staff, you would have thought that the drinks would arrive relatively quickly. After 20 minutes of sitting there, we discovered (after going up to speak to the barman) that our drinks had been poured some time ago, and the waiters had simply left them on the side. No attempt had been made to locate us (I had pointed to our table when I ordered the drinks), and no apology was made when we finally got our drinks.We then gave the place the benefit of the doubt and decided to get a couple of cocktails, priced at S$20 each; more fool us! We had seen that some people had ordered from their table, so tried to catch the eye of several of the waiters, who were standing around doing nothing. No luck. We then decided to order at the bar. I joined a short queue (with about 3 people in front of me) and waited for someone to take orders. It took around 5 minutes for one of the waiters standing idly by to go to the front of the queue and start taking orders. After the first couple were taken, a large group came up the stairs and sat down in reserved seats (incidentally, we had tried to book a table and were told that seats cannot be reserved). All of the waiters, including the one at the front of the queue, rushed over to the group to (presumably) start taking orders from them. At this stage, the people in front of me in the queue decided they'd had enough and left. I waited and was eventually able to give my order after about 10 minutes of queuing.Half an hour later, our drinks still hadn't arrived. Watching the bar, the barman had plainly got fed up of expecting the waiters to take customers' orders, and started taking them himself. This was, unsurprisingly, fantastic for the people who were making the orders at that point, as the barman would quickly make them their drinks. Unfortunately, those of us that had relied on the waiters taking the order had to continue to wait. We were on the verge of leaving (we had stood up and left the table) when our drinks suddenly materialised. Whether they had been coincidentally made just in time, or whether they had been made some time before and forgotten about, I do not know.This bar has the feel of a provincial pub that has only just opened, and was swept off its feet. Unfortunately, this is a pricey bar, in a modern city, which has been open for some time, and which was less than half full. The staff are uncoordinated, don't seem to know their role, and have no communication between one another. You can get the view in a number of places in Singapore. Avoid this one.",

The views are incredible but the bar was closed and looked slightly the worse for wear. You can't really look down because of the structure of the treetop but the horizon view is great. I'm sure it looks better at night. We went back downstairs to get our drink and to take in our surroundings. The top half of the walls are covered in plastic cloverleaf and plastic ivy is coiled over some exposed pipes. I'm not sure if this is meant to continue the garden theme but it just looks tacky.

We were told by the waitress we could have free desserts but we were no longer hungry, we had been there for over 2 hours now. When the bill arrived we found that they had taken 20% off food- not drinks and the $20 service charge was still on there!! After a disappointing meal we decided to go upstairs to the rooftop bar enjoy on last drink, after waiting 20 minutes we walked out. Awful experience in such a nice setting.

The evening started on a high in the top of the supertree with cocktails overlooking the gardens, very pleasant experience We then made our way down to the restaurant which had no more than 4 tables dining, at the time I thought this was very odd being in such a prime location and at peak time however it wasn't long before we found out why...As it was a special occasion we ordered a bottle of champagne, we were immediately told by our waitress that they have no champagne available, 12 different bottles on the menu and not one available?? We opted for the sparkling water instead Similar issues arose with our food order with many unavailable dishes We eventually completed an order with crispy prawns, rice paper rolls and some mixed gourmet meats, pork Loin and Vietnamese beef. What a disappointment, prawns with soggy and mushy, certainly not crisp and the mains were bland and tough.To top it off A minimum spend of $80 per head is required to dine in this restaurant, perhaps to compensate for their lack of customers....",

I would say it's the worst food for whole lot of money. We ordered a bottle of cheap wine for 105 dollars. It needed to breathe a little but our waiter started to pour into our glasses right away while my husband was trying to tell him to wait. My husband and friend ordered lemongrass sea bass and I ordered tiger prawn and pomelo salad while other friend ordered Vietnamese style beef. I almost fell out of my chair when I saw my salad. It said tiger prawn but it was more like kitten shrimp. I m not joking about the size of three shrimp that as in the salad. When I questioned the size after I saw someone next to me ordering different tiger prawn dish which was decent size, they said because mine was salad. Sure, since I must look stupid that I should accept that answer. The dressing on the salad did not go well with pomelo since it was Vietnamese fish sauce dressing. With most being the pomelo, and the small portion I still couldn't finish it because it was so salty and overwhelming smell of fish sauce. When it was time for our check, they informed us we need to spend 70 more dollars since it's required to spend at least 80 per person. Since we know the quality of the food and the taste, our guys decided in couple of cognacs which was 28 dollars each. It must have been a joke because the serving size was a barely a sip. I understand that they must have to pay high rent to charge so much but the serving sizes there was a joke as well as the waiters and rest of the working staff. They were not trained to recommend or tell us about the spending until we got the check, they didn't know who ordered what so they try to give me my husbands dish, they were not informed about the wine to let it breathe, trying to explain why my tiger prawn was so small compare to other people's tiger prawns dish by telling me because mine was a salad. The service staff isn't well trained for the place where they charge so much money for not so edible good. Do not waste money for it really isn't worth it even for the view.",

We asked to see the food menu and we ordered from the menu (mainly fried stuff). All the food was cold when we got it and the last appetizer came only after we reminded the manager. Waiter was still chatting at bar and never came over once to see if we wanted any more drinks or if everything was alright. While we were waiting for our last appetizer to arrive, we noticed other tables were ordering from the restaurant menu, When I flagged our waiter and asked if we came too early to order from the restaurant menu, he said we had to specifically ask for it as they don't \"like\" serving dinners at the small tables. Personally, I think he was too lazy to carry up the trays. Deceptive hostess, bad waiter, mediocre cold food and expensive. The manager was the only professional person in the whole place.

The other wait staff in the lift, not at all. We arrived on the 16th floor and were told we can only sit in a confined \"bar stool\" area. It was sunny and we couldn't find a spot. The waiter was inattentive and busy chatting with other staffs. We were shoved a drinks menu. We asked what beer there was. Suddenly they jittered amongst themselves. And one of the waiters told us, the roof top is now open. We can go there if we like. There were already several guests there drinking and some leaving. So I don't understand the meaning of \"now open\". Seemed the rooftop was already opened earlier. Anyway we sat and ordered drinks. There's only 2 types of generic bottled beer to choose from. Certainly doesn't worth $18. For the non-alcoholic drink, I asked if it came in a can. He said yes. But later it was just a glass. Seemed less than a can. He didn't seem to understand English so well, so forget it. The view isn't bad but service is terrible. Even the roof top had a strange fried food smell seeping from the wooden planks.

I was served a chicken thigh and wing ... after failing to get someones attention to question it, I ate anyway and it was fine. Not great, not bad, but just not what I had expected. When my server removed my plate (including my entree plate which was inexplicably still on my table), he mumbled something about telling the chef.Dessert was a simple, but well done, sticky rice with lovely fresh mango. The coconut cream was just the right amount and a good way to finish my meal.When I received my bill I was charged for the more expensive main I had received rather than the one I had ordered, but dessert was complimentary.

Any comments about the bar? Not really, similar to any other bars. I'm probably biased in this aspect because when you are there, you are totally immersed in the amazing 360 degrees view around you.

We left at 7ish 8 and realized the restaurant is not full unlike the last time when we dined there.. they have many areas that they can improve on to attract and retain customers...1. Hygiene was questionable as the table runner and table mats were dirty with crumbs and stains.. The restrooms were dirtier than the public restrooms at Gardens by the Bay. Our public restroom attendants are amazing!2. Service by the crew was passable though the waitress could serve us drinks faster and be a little more attentive3. Horrible service rendered by the manager: we ordered many dishes (12 orders in total) so we only placed orders for 2 bowls of rice... they scooped the rice for us from a rice serving bowl so we didnt know that we will be charged for 3 bowls of rice instead of 2. We did not ask for refills and in fact I accepted only a small portion of rice when the waitress served me, The extra bowl costs $4, only 1% of our bill but it gave me a surprise and I merely asked the waiter to check the bill. The manager Paul came over and told us that they should charge us 5 bowls of rice instead since there were 5 of us so charging us 3 is already lenient of them. He added that if we want the rice in small bowls we have to specify. He took my husband's credit card before I can react and charged us the bill. When I recovered from his brash response I asked him if he thinks it is okay to charge customers what they did not order, he replied no. Any honest person will know that its wrong yet he knowingly treats customers that way... time to improve on customer service.",

We did not have, a problem with that as in the past it would be well worth it.However, it seems that now they have the minimum charge the standards have slipped.Food....... Very nice but nothing special. No 'Wow factor' as it had previously. Just good standard food and presentation that you can get in many restaurants in Singapore.Service..... Quite non existent at our table, yet we were there before they got busy. Not once did we get service without having to summons staff to the table.Food service....... Two meals came at same time, other meal at least 10 minutes later. Not good enough for this standard of restaurant.After asking staff 3 times where is the pak choy we ordered, and being told they would check, we were almost finished our meal when I told them to just cancel it. No apology forthcoming they just accepted we didn't want it now.Staff cleared the table after our meal but no offer of dessert or coffee was forthcoming.Our table had a candle just as all the other tables did..... But somehow they lit the ones on the other tables but took our one away.Overall...... A very disappointing experience in what should be one of the finest restaurants in Singapore. We won't be returning in a hurry.Tip for owners....... Putting an $80 minimum charge is fine but it lifts people's expectations. Get the standard back to what it was a few months ago and you will meet those expectations. At present they are a long way short.",

When we arrived, there was no service staff to seat us. We saw an unoccupied table with used plates and glasses and decided to take that table. The service staff came and cleared the table then took our orders. We ordered a glass of beer and a glass of wine, which was part of deal for the entry fee we had paid.About 30 minutes later, one of the managers (he was wearing white shirt and grey pants while the rest of the service staff were wearing a black polo tee) came with a bill and wanted us to settle the bill. We did not order any food and the drinks we had ordered should be complimentary so we told him that there should nothing on the bill, it was clearly a mistake. The manager looked annoyed as if we refused to pay for something that we had ordered. He turned around and left, scolding us something in a language we didn't understand. I thought he must have made a mistake and probably was mad that perhaps, the previous customer left without settling the bill. 15 minutes later, he came around again, instead of apologising for his mistake, he said, \"Would you like to order more drinks? or do you still want your free drinks?\" Right after he said that, he smirked, turned around and walked down the stairs. What kind of attitude was that? I was shocked. He made a mistake, did not apologise, and showed us his terrible attitude.

The variety and quality of food down there was quite good and the prices quite low - something of a rarity for Singapore these days. We went out looking around the beautiful city of Singapore and wound up at the gardens and were truly amazed at the wonder of this place. We had been out all day that day and it was getting close to dinner time. We looked at the cafe's at the other end of the park and it had quite a variety of food but nothing really appealed to either of us. Then we saw this restaurant and it looked amazing. My wife was really keen to go up and try it. I wasn't really fazed either way to be honest. The prices were not terribly expensive but it wasn't cheap either so for that reason you could expect high quality food.The d\u00e9cor is something to be proud of and the staff were really nice and professional. We went up the lift and were shown to our table. We ordered our meals and a couple of drinks and soaked up the atmosphere - it was getting darker outside now and the lights around the restaurant were being turned on. Almost immediately our meals came out with the drinks. I ordered a selection of seafood and my wife ordered fish and vegetables. My wife was really impressed with the fish and passed me some on her fork. It really was very nice, then I tried my seafood. That's odd!!! It was room temperature, I really didn't give it a second thought and just ate my meal. That was a mistake - seafood and room temperature do not mix!! About an hour later we were almost back at our hotel and I was starting to feel the effects of what that meal had done to me. Perhaps it was just bad luck? Perhaps the staff thought it was normal to eat seafood that way. But any chef should surely know that isn't the case. It's a pity as the restaurant is in a fantastic location and the surroundings were superb. This experience didn't ruin our holiday luckily my wife had something in our medical kit which got me back on track within hours, however if I went back - I might just take a sandwich and sit down and watch the light show next time.

So we called to make a booking on Friday to dine on Sunday at 7.30. So as per usual, we arrived at the restaurant and told the receptionist that we have reserved a table for 2 under the name of xxx. Then she looked at the list and couldn't find our booking. So she called upstairs to the restaurant to ask if there's any table for us and while they were checking upstairs, the receptionist asked us to wait on one side whilst she served the rest of the people in the queue. 15 mins later.... still waiting.... she finally told us that they don't have our reservation and there's no free table until 9.30 (which was 1.5 hrs away). So I said, I called on Friday to reserve a table, it's not my fault that you don't send SMS or email confirmation for table reservations. So how was I supposed to make sure that I have a booking?! Then she called up again and this time magically there was a table available!! (I wasn't trying to make her live difficult to be honest, it's because it was our last night in Singapore and all the restaurant in that area is either completely full or it's at least 20 mins walk away)Anyway, so we have a free table so I thought we'll just head up to the restaurant and enjoy our dinner. As we got up to the top, the front of house lady was very welcoming and she showed us to our table and she gave us our menu. But I guess that's all the service we deserved... We were studying the menu for at least 10 mins with no one coming to take our drinks order. We had to track down one of the by passing waiter to get a drink. Then finally some grumpy old man came to our table to take our food order. Our food came relatively quickly but no one told us what food they were putting on our table and our appetizers/mains were all thrown on our table until there was not enough room to put everything... The grumpy old man actually removed my mobile phone from the table to put down one plate of food then walked behind me and put the phone back down on the other side of the table!! Really not sure what kind of service is that?! So after all the food was left on our table there were none of those 'enjoy your meal' or would you like any sauce or anything else, we were just left on our own. No one came to top up our water, no one came to check whether we are ok or not.After we've finished our meal, I had to ask twice for the bill coz they've forgotten about us. As we walked towards the door, the grumpy old man walked passed us without even saying thank you or hope you've enjoyed your meal etc. He just walked straight passed us!!It's a pitty service is so bad in Indochine. I mean, a meal up there is not one of your averagely priced meal. We had 2 glasses of Processo, after tax and service is over S$21 and that's already on offer! One bottle of wine starts from S$106 after tax. With these sort of price, I would expect a little bit better service. All in all, I can only see the front of house lady running around taking guests to tables, taking orders, serving food, topping up water and pretty much anything and everything that needs doing, she's there. But there's only one of her....The 2 points is only for the view from the restaurant and for the rooftop bar. Really very bad service.",

Thank you!) serving us for the night was wonderful. We were having some drinks (mine's a White Witch cocktail, and his was a Stella), when we looked out and saw a walkway. We asked our waiter if we could go out on the veranda, and he said, yes, and helped us to bring our drinks outside, and recommended a seat that had a fantastic view of the MBS. He also brought our appetizer (white bait with salted egg crumbs) out to us, and said that he would call us when our mains are ready. For our mains, he also recommended that we have rice with our mains (honey ribs and beef rump), as that would make the dishes more tasty. Throughout dinner, he was attentive without being intrusive, and we managed to have a lovely dinner. He also remembered my first drink was a White Witch, and asked if he could bring me another when he saw my glass was empty. Pro-tips:1. Ask for a seat inside rather than near the entrance, because the chairs are more comfortable2. The mains are quite large, so they're good for sharing (maybe 2 mains to 3 people).3. Do go up to the rooftop bar - this was quite possibly the best. We were trapped due to heavy rain, but I think you can also have dinner upstairs on the bar.

We had made a reservation for 3 for 8pm. We arrived at about 7.50pm but had to stand at the base of the supertree waiting for more than 5 minutes to be allowed to go up via the lift. This process could be speeded up, perhaps by having 2 separate queues/lines: one for diners, and a second for those paying $18.00 (!) to go up to the bar. We were seated by someone with a walky-talky, clearly communicating with the downstairs entrance fiasco. I'm uncertain as to who this gentleman was, but sadly he (and another lady with walky-talky) continued to walk past us throughout the evening talking loudly into said walky-talkies, with zero concern for the diners around them. That, together with the overly loud background music, did not lend itself to easy and audible conversation.We were handed un-opened menus (a pet-hate of my husbands) by a waitress and then left for about 15 minutes, eventually having to ask someone whether we could order. To be fair, the food came quickly and was very good. This sounds as if we were surprised. It's just that in our humble opinions, the restaurant currently has the ambiance of a blend of Disney with bordello. The decor is just not in keeping with what one expects from IndoChine. You have this sensational view, only to be obscured by the reflection in the windows of dozens of big Christmas-like baubles (and this is July!) hanging around the bar and other parts of the restaurant. Admittedly, on the website, it is advertised as having an \"unobstructed view\", but this is certainly not the case from inside the restaurant. The table linen looks cheap as do the chairs, which were purple-coloured velour and pretty uncomfortable. To add salt to the wound, they even had fake orchid arrangements everywhere . . . Really?! Orchids are Singapore! And if cared for, last several weeks, so why the plastic repros? On their website they claim that all plastic used is PET plastic, which is a good thing, but we are in the \"Gardens\" by the Bay . . . again, only our humble opinion.We would love to say that we would return to this restaurant but we're going to be honest and admit that unless there are some serious changes, that won't be happening. Good food, but it needs more than that to make for a memorable dining experience. But if you do go to dine, make sure you pay a visit to the bar upstairs. The views are sensational there but we didn't stay for a drink so cannot pass comment.",

A great big man-made structure that resembles a metal tree. You go toward the entrance, its a bit like a lighthouse; theres a small door at the foot. There is a concierge there to check your reservation. The place is lit up like a christmas tree - all green and blue neon coming from these weird slightly tacky looking lights. But you know its an Indochine restaurant so you're not worried yet. They're all classy and stylish right? Wrong. So after the concierge confirmed your reservation, and sends you upstairs. You walk thru the entrance, and into the Supertree itself; a shabby corridor filled with useless bric-a-brac for sale at ridiculous prices. No one's actually in there, its just a passage to the lift which someone saw fit to fill with rubbish - literally. There were a few bags of garbage by the fire exit, and some builders stuff. You go up the lift. When you come out, there is another concierge - who inexplicably, checks your reservation again. Maybe because we managed to lie our way past the first concierge? Then you're shown to your seat...they walk you by the bar, and the first thing you notice is the green neon LED lights behind the bar - and we're not talking fancy fibre optics or something artistic; its basically the stuff you see at night markets. I can buy in Sim Lim for 30 bucks. Then you notice the christmas lights. Yes, Christmas lights. Great big clusters of them, cheap and tacky balls of glowing plastic hanging all over the place. Then you notice the green astroturf they've used as a kind of wallpaper. Then you notice that all of this serves to cause glare on the windows, so you can't actually see outside the spectacular view of Singapore skyline, you just see a reflection of stupid christmas lights. Then you see your zebra/cowpat mohair seat, and the disco ball hanging from the ceiling directly above you. The staff at least have the good grace to look embarrassed about it all, I mean, would you be happy about working a 10hr shift there? I really felt for them, and the demented designer that set that place up...service wasn't great, but I didn't have the heart to hold it against them. I'd be miserable if I had to work there too. The worst part of all this is that the food is actually excellent. Like, really nice! Indochine have several restaurants in Singapore; incidentally, one of them my boss took me to when pitching the idea of moving jobs to Singapore - their Boat Quay / Asian Civilisation Museum Indochine. That place had some impact in our final decision, it was that good. But the Supertree branch manages to brutally murder every possible endearing feature to it and turn what could be an award-winning restaurant into something cheap and annoying. In this respect it is a spectacular example of what a bad interior can do.Given there are some uber-slick restaurants in SG around that same price point (including their own branches!) its hard to imagine the incredible gall of the management; its like they sat down and said \"there's someone with more money than taste born every minute, no one really cased about this stuff\" and made it their business model.So, we didn't get dressed up to spend $100 a head on this, so we left after the starter and had a burrito at Muchachos instead. No regrets.I'm not usually this scathing on reviews, so here's something constructive to feedback to the management. Tear out every single fitting and fixture not utility or structurally necessary; paint everything not a window in white paint; get some simple wooden tables an chairs from ikea; put some tea lights on the table. And thats it. Let your spectacular view do the talking, don't try and shout over it - because that little voice saying you need zebra hair seating is not your friend.

I went to the two domes and took the sky walk way. It was great. I was really enjoying myself taking many photos of this really beautiful city until I walked into Supertree by Indochine. My mood was completely tarnish. I would say this restaurant - Supertree by Indochine is a complete rat hole! As a walk-in guest, I was treated like a fly. Knowing that I was a walk-in guest, this particular host shove me aside and ask me to wait while she assist the guests on the reserve list. I did not understand why did the host at the ground level need to do so much walkie-talkie talking to check on tables when the restaurant is almost empty? When I reached the restaurant level, one Indian staff tried to take my order. This particular Indian staff was really arrogant. He tried to force me to order a main course when I insist that I only want tapas. While the indian staff look arrogant, he spoke like a mouse. I could not hear him at all when he was repeating my order. After he took my order, i observe that he went to tell another staff not to pay attention to me because I only order tapas. What kind of lousy, abhorrent, sucky attitude is this? Is this Indian staff the captain or what? Also the menu is very confusing - Indochine is like squeezing almost a dish from every country in their menu. When my food arrive, they were cold. The food are expensive and taste horrible. What kind of chefs they hire? Of all, the entire restaurant decorations look like a war-zone! Buddha heads' sitting on the wall. It is not worth the price at all! Very cheap table linen which I just saw at Chinatown were used. Extremely awful fake flowers and cheap looking plates and bowls - basically it is a rate hole! The staffs - Indian & filippinos spoke in terrible English which I could not understand. Really lousy & distasteful! I suggest all DO NOT STEP FOOT IN HERE! As an expat, I recommend you might as well go to coffee shops and hawker centres in Singapore where you can at least get some real tasty food and at least have a sincere but slow coffee aunty serving you. Supertree Indochine clearly is not a restaurant! Is it a coffee shop or hawker centre? Well, it is not good enough to be a coffee shop either! It is just a complete rat hole! DON\"T GO! DON\"T WASTE YOUR TIME! VERY SUCKY! Worst than terrible! On a fair note, only one thing is acceptable - Singapore's night view compensated for it at the rooftop bar.",

The Indian waiter got our order wrong, and tried to insist that it was what we had ordered, when clearly it was not, even bringing the offending plate back a second time, trying to make us take it. I had ordered the fresh spring rolls for my pre-schooler, as she will not eat the deep fried kind, which is what they had brought.

It did not come until I had already finished my meal.We stayed till around 8:15pm and the restaurant was half empty, so I don't see why we had been given the time limit, of only being allowed the table for less than an hour, until 8pm.

They ordered (without knowing the name of the dish, eg. Kampong Chicken) more than 11 main dishes with fried rice & plain rice to fill the \"gap\", it was indeed an excellent idea, ironically, it was more like they wanted more of most dishes but there were not enough to go around for 2nd serving. In summary, the food is excellent.Secondly...the ambience of the restaurant, it was deemly lit and has a romantic feel around the area. There were pillows for those that are seated next to the window, it's probably good for people that are smaller frame but not ideal for the bigger frame guests as it reduce the area they can sit...so they were trying to shaft the pillows around and they end up piling the pillows (which keeps dropping on the floor) on one of the empty seat.We have made couple of attempt to ask the staff to remove the pillows, but no one seems to be interested. Apparently they were using a lift to send food (through a window) up to the restaurant, and we saw this guy having problem with the food and ended with all the food spilling down the lift chute with lots of clanks and bangs...not sure if it's a people issue or the design of the lift needs to be reviewed, it's definitely a talking point for the guests as couple of them were seated right infront the lift.Thirdly, ambience of the rooftop bar, we were lucky that the night was cooling, it was unanimous that the views was fantastic with Marina Bay Sand, Singapore Flyer, Keppel port, rest of Singapore skyline in sight; we can also clearly see the brightly litted F1 pit, I highly recommend you to check out this place even if you are no intention to dine in the restaurant.

However, upon arrival we found only a very few people. So not sure why they were so snotty about availability and times. While I don't have a lot of criticism regarding the food, I would simply say it was good, not out of the world and very expensive. My comments have more to do with the setting and the decor. This is a very unique site, but the interior and the decor have absolutely no relationship with the unique environment that the restaurant is in. To say it is garish or even weird doesn't do it justice. My guess is that the wife or girlfriend of some executive at the restaurant company got the job of decoration. This company should rethink the interior and aline the inside of this restaurant with the location.",

What attracted me to this place despite the negative reviews was the varied cuisine which is a concoction of Thai, Laotian and Vietnamese cuisine amongst others. In terms of atmosphere, the place has unfortunately become somewhat of a tourist destination which apparently necessitated the restaurant to post someone downstairs to vet people downstairs (not sure if they charge a fee if you don't go upstairs to drink or eat). Anyway, I had made reservations but the girl downstairs couldn't find it initially and wasn't too subtle in her approach. Once we cleared that hurdle however, we quickly made our way up to the restaurant where the experience and the level of service quickly improved in terms of food and service, although the decor could be improved to fully realise the potential of this magnificent building with its amazing views.First the good aspects though: the service from the waiting staff was very friendly and they were not pushy at all. They even suggested that we take only a half seafood platter, even though we had already ordered the platter for 4 (not knowing we could opt for a 2pax platter). The staff even re-opened a section of the restaurant that they had closed for the night (we arrived late) for us so we could get the view we wanted.The real highlight of the night however was the food. The seadood platter was great and consisted of super-fresh oysters, scallops, mussels, shrimp (although they weren't the advertised tiger prawns) and salmon. The seafood was accompanied by great sauces! We also had a very tasty kampong chicken dish and tasty beef 'carpaccio' (a take on larb nuea). One dish however did not impress and is one we will not order next time we visit. The tom yam was quite bland and generic and did not have the wow-factor of the other dishes. Many people complain about the price of drinks, however we had a decently priced Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc at SGD90 (which is not unreasonable for Singapore). One cocktail we had as an apperetif (I can't remember the name but it contained vodka and lychees) was very tasty and refreshing.The one aspect of the restaurant that I found disappointing is the decor. It feels like the interior is one big disjointed collection of items scraped together during yard sales from different families. I don't mean to offend anybody but I don't see the aesthetic design principle behind the chosen interior design or the quirkiness that may have been intended with this approach. I believe a slightly more minimalistic and modern asian interior with more subdued lighting (now the lights are too bright and reflect against the window, distracting from and obscuring the great scenery outside) would do this place much more justice and support the delicious food and gorgeous views.

After booking for New Years Eve by email and having contact with the restaurant 2 days prior and giving credit card details both by email and telephone, we assumed our booking was confirmed and looking forward to our special New Years Eve in this restaurant with a view.How wrong were we....It was a wet night so our Taxi dropped us off and we had to walk about 15 minutes the long way to keep under cover and then a brisk walk with no cover to the Supertree. Greeted by two female receptionists, who under the circumstances that was to follow, did their best. The reception area is so small and is the entrance to the \"tree\" with a very narrow walkway once past the reception desk to the lift,. We paid by credit card and checked the price just before we were shown to the lift and surprise surprise, the price was not as quoted. We had actually been quoted for the Xmas Special which resulted in a misunderstanding of prices but after about 40 minutes of discussions and trying to sort this problem out with the Manager, we came to a mutual compromise of the quoted rate without the alcohol included. At this point no adjustments were made to our credit card charge and we were happy to sort out later. We were taken up in the lift to the Dining Area. Expecting a lovely setting and furnishings, we were sadly surprised at the tacky interior but this was not the problem. We were left waiting near the lift doors for about 10 minutes for our table (we did have a booking). We were then greeted by the same male \"thug\" who other reviewers have mentioned. (Had we read the previous reviews we would not have even booked here. This person then said he had our table ready but couldnt seat us together/ ????We had booked for 4 people, and I would have assumed a booking for 4 meant at the same table but oh no, this staff member who was intent of being as unpleasant as possible, then claimed we did not have a booking. At this stage it was at least one hour since we first entered reception. Again we explained we had a booking and he then claimed we had not contacted them and paid a deposit, all with the threatening manner of a Pit Bull about to attack.(Apologies to Pit Bulls) By this stage we had had enough and said we would not accept separate tables and had confirmed booking for 4. Again this person with his threatening and unpleasant manner, accused us of not having a booking and by this stage we had had enough and requested our credit card be credited, we would go elsewher and we would be contacting Indochine management. He then made an attempt to start phoning somebody to see what he could do but we refused staying there any longer and insisted our credit charge be credited immediately which is was. Never ever have we encountered such an unprofessional and disgraceful representative of any business and for this person to be representing Indochine, it is the worst advertising for their business possible. This person thinks he is bigger than the Indochine enterprise itself and if this is the kind of staff member representing this Company, Indochine either need to dispense with his services immediately or they will loose so many customers and any good name their company still has. From the reviews on Supertree, we were lucky we didnt eat there. Instead we had the wonderful night we had at Clarke Quay with good food, fabulous friendly staff who value their jobs and their customers and enjoyed the New Years Eve celebrations. My advice is DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT . There are many many nicer restaurants with lovely friendly staff who offer good service, good value, and lovely food., Maybe Indochine will realise they have a problem at this restaurant and do something about it.",

Upon arriving at third floor, nobody was there to greet us to show us to our seats so we just walked to a table and sat down. The starter was pretty good, considering we were already very hungry when we got there. But our salad had a live worm in it. They were very apologetic and gave us another fresh salad (with only two salad leaves instead, and more of the other stuff, maybe to decrease the chances of us finding another worm?). Anyway the manager apologised countless times and did not charge us for the salad. The kampung chicken was reasonably good, but the prawns were nothing to shout about. The toilets needed cleaning. Looked dusty and felt like it was the staff's toilet. I think the decor bothered me more than anything. It just looked cheap, old, dusty and tasteless, and felt like it some some store house for them to keep their unwanted vases. I was trying very hard to find the wow factor.

The maitre d\u2019 continued the line that we had no booking despite showing him the phone log from my mobile, detailing exactly when we had called. The attitude seemed to be one of \u2018we don\u2019t care you can just leave\u2019. There was not even a hint of an apology. Grudgingly we were then offered an inside table suitable for only 2 people. After explaining this was unsuitable as we had booked for four, at an outside table, we were then shown upstairs to the bar to wait whilst a table became available. After 35 minutes in the bar we had still not even received the drinks that we had ordered, taking the top off a bottle of beer was obviously beyond the bar staffs capability. Eventually when we were shown to an available table it was a lounge type chair, where you required to have the arm reach of inspector gadget to actually reach the food on the table. The same maitre d\u2019 asking us sarcastically if \u2018this one is good enough for you?\u2019. Another waiter then appeared to tell us the Asahi we had ordered 35 minutes previously were not available. How on earth can it take that long?The evening continued with mistaken orders and rare steaks arriving well done. After finishing the main course we noticed our waitress for the evening collecting her bag and leaving. It was then over an hour before anyone else came to ask us for any additional drinks order, also at no point were we even offered the dessert menu. All in all this Indochine was like Fawlty Towers without the laughs.

We were prepared to wlk the 300 steps up to the top, but we were told \"no\". So we waited and waited until finally Mr Otis came along and managed to fix the problem very quickly. We were seated immediately, mainly due to the fact that there were very few people in the restaurant. That was the end of the service. We ordered wine (very expensive) and after waiting ten minutes and having to call for a waitress we were told that the wine was being chilled and would be another ten minutes. We ordered a different bottle and eventually it arrived. The food order eventually arrived and the dishes we chose were good. However, the salmon rolls were rather ordinary. Meanwhile.... The smell of glue was strong as they are still trying finish the decorating. And the man behind the bar up a ladder drilling holes didn't add to the lack of service. The ambience and decorating is also a bit tacky. Bunches of plastic flowers stuck into plastic moss covers the area around the bar. Ghastly. The view from inside the Supertree is obscured by the \"branches\" of the tree. The area outside with stools and small tables probably does offer a better view of the gardens. There is also the problem of only one toilet and it is unisex. Not sure how it is going to cater for patrons when the restaurant is full.We asked to speak to the manager and explain our grievances. He explained that the restaurant had only been open two weeks. It is a chain, and a successful one. It is a shame that they can't open a new restaurant without so many problems. Unfortunately... I will not be returning.",

I therefore didn't hesitate to book the restaurant when my niece and sister-in-law, who were visiting from Sydney, said they would like to eat Indian.What a contrast with my previous experience.When seating us at our table, the waiter passed us two menus - one containing the set menus and the other being the 'a la carte' menu. Once we realised this I asked if we could have three 'a la carte' menus: a second was reluctantly provided after quite a wait. We proceeded to place our order including a chicken curry. The waiter's response: words to the effect of '...that is not a good choice as it has a whole green chilli...'. I said that wasn't a problem but he was adamant in trying to get me to change our order - in an almost condescending manner. In the end I pointed out that as we'd eaten street food including stuffed peppers in India we were perfectly capable of handling a dish with a single chilli so he reluctantly accepted the order.Perhaps it was the fact that we were three 'ang mo' ladies so he assumed we were all tourists and hence needed to be told what curries to eat. Why assume that all 'ang mo' diners are not familiar with, or cannot tolerate, spicy Indian food?In the event, the chicken curry was quite bland - in spite of the single green chilli. The remaining dishes were okay, but it is difficult to see value in $12 for a single bowl of plain white rice.There are many good Indian restaurants in Singapore so I'll not be rushing to take other visitors to Tandoor.",

Also the use of iPad menus is questionable as they don't have enough devices to support the amount of covers on the floor so you can wait 15 mins. just to access the menu. The fundamental issue with this establishing is they don't understand their customers. People want to sit, order a drink, look at a menu and order. These iPad really don't afford any positive customer experience and I think management are using the iPad menu to avoid having to hire staff who can understand English. For example a simple drink order had to be repeated 3 times and then it arrived wrong. On being sent back a rather irate bar attendant accused us of getting the order wrong and did not want to correct the order. Frankly after a busy week who needs this headache when the bill for 2 Pax can easily exceed $100.

For a restaurant of its calibre, the food was underwhelming. We've had better Indian food elsewhere (both at much higher end places and even smaller establishments.) Zaffron Kitchen sits nowhere near them.Biggest gripe for us was the service. We were there on a weekday evening (at about 6). Only 4 tables were filled. Yet it took them about 15 minutes to get our dessert out. (It was a cake with ice-cream. How much work do you need for that?) Our bill took a while to come as well. Not 15 mins, but just as bad. The rest of our earlier orders did not take long but spending a good half of our dinner waiting for dessert and the bill is not the way we'd wanted to end a long work day. If service was this bad and slow on a weekday we can only imagine how much worse it can get if the place is full. We didn't like it either when the wait staff kept coming after every dish to ask about how the food was. You could see that they were asking not out of sincerity but more out of routine and because they had to. That was the turn off for us. Stop bothering us in the middle of our dinner and don't ask if you're just going through the motions. The only plus point we could give was that the price is quite justified for the portion of food we got. They didn't stinge on that. \u25cf Note to share for local diners: We were told by the staff that the restaurant serves halal meats but do not have the MUIS certification because they serve alcohol on the menu.

Being our first time, my partner and I walked in on without reservation at 6.30pm to a pretty vacant place with a few families, seated quickly but menus(ipads in a wooden box) took more than 20 minutes before we could get hold of one. A couple who were seated inside after us had a menu handed to them immediately.I caught the attention of the Assistant Manager dressed in black and told him that we were still waiting to have a look at what's on offer(apart from the table standee promoting their Michenlin Set, which was not appealing to us for that price point); he waltzed along to grab one and handed one to us. Here's where his customer service went to pieces, all my partner asked was why did it take so long to be handed a menu and the priority of service went to the couple after us. This is the dialogue that followed:Manager: \"Well we do not keep track of who walks in first, we are so busy\"Partner: \"Do you only have a few working ipads? (there was a bunch of them lying down on the service table near the kitchen pick up, I'm presuming all drained out.)Manager: \"We have been busy the whole day and have not been able to charge them.\"Me: \"Shouldn't you guys have portable chargers for days like this? It can not be the first time to be so busy.\"Partner: \"I think 20 minutes is a tad too long to be just be handed a menu\"Manager: \"Look, if you want to go, you can just go, if you want to eat here you have to wait, we are very busy.\"Not once did the manager apologise, and I'm sorry, if a food establishment is busy running from lunch service till closing, that should be a good indication that you are doing something right and you should be prepared to be on your toes because your business is good! They had 1 Asst Manger, 1 cashier lady, and 2-3 servers. The bill came faster than we could guesture for it, maybe the cashier lady should lend a helping hand in the service.And the problem when you have electronic menus is battery life and that should have been thought out, or at the very least have a hardcopy menu as backup; I'm sure you started with a hardcopy folder before switching to an app based system. Also, the menus had no description of the ingredients, we had to Google the dishes to find out what was what.We, a handful of other couples and the food delivery pick up guys spent the next hour waiting and observing how other patrons were eagle-eyed by waiters to minimise their usage of the limited number of ipads so that it could passed along like some sort of musical chair(ipad).Food wise, it was all good as it seemed like each dish was only prepared when ordered which added to the wait times as well, this on top of the fact that dine in patrons were also \"competing\" with the food delivery pick up guys did not help with the wait. Quality is the reason that they were awared the Michelin review but quantity wise for the price seems a bit lacking; but enough for a couple.Overall, I would recommend it for the quality of food, only if you'd be willing to wait out and the inconsistent customer service, but I might consider ordering from the food delivery apps to bypass all this hassle.",

Price wise I find it more costly than the other ramen shops in Singapore, cheapest ramen shiromaru motoaji being $18 (you can choose to have it without the egg though - $15). Taste wise, not the most mind blowing but i enjoyed it. Compared to other ramen shops, the tonkotsu was not overly salty yet fragrant and creamy. I can even smell my neighbour's tonkotsu! Definitely unassuming yet memorable. I ordered extra hard noodles but I still find it at the slightly softer side, was looking forward to more chewy noodles. But that was fine for me. Also ordered the famous pork bun but was turn off by the fatty piece of pork. People who prefer lean meat should not order this. Will return for the shiromaru motoaji :)",

So for 3 dollars, I bought myself a regular hard boiled egg.At other ramen places you can order ramen refills, and some even have free flow of hard boiled eggs.

Business was brisk & the dining area was almost filled to capacity. The atmosphere was rara & lively with cooks & servers greeting customers in loud unison when customers enter & leave.I studied the menus & decided to order from the takeout counter. The waitress promptly showed me to the counter. I was warmly greeted by their Japanese chef.I opted chicken soup ramen, no oil, strong flavour, extra noodle, extra egg, standard onion & garlic. Chef studied my order carefully when keying into the cash register.The commis prepared my noodle while Chef took charge of my soup & plating. While waiting for the soup to boil, we had time for a quick chat. Chef checked the finished product against my order chit again before handing over the finished product. The pace was relaxing. Chef's display of the pride in his work builds up my anticipation to eat his ramen. Best, I paid SGD12 which is almost the average cost of a meal at Rasapura Masters foodcourt.Condiments like white & black pepper in pepper mills, chili flakes & sesame were provided. Utensils were smartly packed in transparent packaging, complete with paper napkin & toothpick.The yellow ramen's texture is somewhat like a thinner version of 'Singapore Hokkien noodle' but had better taste, bite, elasticity & does not get soggy within a short period of time. The broth was rich yet not cloying, sweet, tasty & piping hot to the last. Dice white onion lends a refreshing crunch to the overall taste. The egg has a smooth & flawless exterior & yolk lavas out like how a good lava cake should. The portioning is smaller than most ramen other shops I have tried.I finished all within minutes, instantly felt better & still had appetite for more food!",

It started well with the Gyoza and the Pork Bun, both while not fabulous, were still quite nice - both in taste and in the moistness & softness.

And I found it rather alkaline (i.e. tasted as if it has a lot of \u6898\u6c34), leaving me a lingering and uncomfortable sense of fullness after drinking just a third of it. As for the noodle itself, I found it very ordinary, just like any Jap restaurant ramen elsewhere. The saving grace was that most of the waitresses were patient, courteous and helpful. One of them thoughtfully asked whether we wanted to cut the pork bun into two as we were sharing, while another asked how we found the meal, and if we had any issues with it.

The location of this particular Ippudo in Singapore was quite easy to find as it was located in the prime (commercial) area (Orchard Road), in a newly built structure.This time, in order to avoid a big crowd and long queue, I decided to go there around 5:00 pm where the big crowd was not there. When I arrived, I could see the restaurant was almost 70% full and I could not get even my own table. For seconds, I was even thinking to leave the place and return back within an hour, a decision that I might regret if I did that.No more than 15 minutes after I got seated, the place was completely full and I started seeing a queue of patrons waiting outside by the time I left the restaurant slightly after 6:00 pm. For me, it was no surprise at all to find many people visiting this establishment after dining in over there. In my personal opinion, Ippudo Singapore has successfully positioned themselves as one of the best places for noodle lovers. One the main distinction they have compare to other Ippudo I had visited outside Singapore is the fact that you are able to select your preference on how you would like your noodles to be served (soft, soft to medium, medium etc.).Overall, I would personally recommend this establishment to everybody who doesn't mind paying premium price for quality ramen/noodle : It's really worth the money.",

After my first visit - which I was impressed - I have been back at least thrice, bringing different friends to introduce them to the delicious ramen served here. This outlet does not allow reservations, and it is not uncommon to see long queues outside the popular restaurant, especially during lunch and dinner hours. The good thing is that the lines are usually cleared very fast.I have tried several types of Ramen here before, but let me share the two most memorable ones. The wonderful thing about their noodles is that it consists of fine strands, springy, and the service crew would ask for \"Doneness\" of noodles - hard or soft. Yes, this is the unique point of Ippudo's ramen - usually I opt for harder noodles.First, the Shiromaru Special - original tonkotsu (pork) broth served with thin noodles, pork loins, cabbage, kikurage and spring onions - on the side are flavored egg, tender pork cube and bamboo shoots. I absolutely love their soups, regardless of which type of ramen I eventually end up ordering. They are always in-your-face delicious, flavored at full blasts, and non-greasy. Being a fan of flavored eggs (their \"braised egg\" is rather different from the other Japanese restaurants' - the inside is tenderly raw while the outside is hard-boiled) and bamboo shoots, the entire combination makes for a really hearty meal.I also love their Spicy Black Pork Ramen -I would add the flavored egg as this does not come with it. Another blend of scrumptious soup base, quality thin noodles, bamboo shoot and best of all, black pork. Somehow, black pork has a luscious, delectable taste in additional to its extreme tenderness. I am usually not a fan of pork, but I do enjoy black pork. The tastiness of black pork cooked with delicious broth and noodles, makes for a very gratifying meal.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-ippudo.html",

The restaurant is has a quirky design that you don't often see in Singapore and has a fresh, young feel to it. As with the other Ippudo restaurants, the staff are energetic and loud! How genuine it all is, I am not quite so sure...! Queuing for restaurants is the norm for many people in Singapore, it was a first for me and I can wholeheartedly (and somewhat surprisingly) say that it was worth it. Larger groups would likely face long wait times at this restaurant, I believe that there is also a separate room for groups looking to make reservations and I may well look into organising a quick team dinner here to try this out.The pork and prawn Ippudo buns, while small, were great (particularly the prawn).Gyoza were just nice, probably the least exciting dish that we tried.The Akamaru Chashu was cooked to perfection, as per the other reviews here, the broth was delicious, noodles (cooked to order) were full of flavour and it was also surprisingly filling. The spicy miso Tonkotsu was certainly spicy so that worked really well for us.So overall, very happy and will be returning, nice setting, great food and affordable prices.",

I ordered the wanton-men and a glass of umeshu sprite, and was pleasantly surprised to see that you could choose how you wanted your ramen cooked (soft, medium or hard). I chose medium, although I think next time I would pick soft for a slightly more springy texture. The broth was lovely, not too salty but packed full of flavour, and the pork was flavoursome and not chewy.

It uses a thick, curly noodles in its standard tonkotsu broth, with a slick of mayu (black-roasted garlic oil) to serve. I loved the chewy texture of the noodles, which paired really well with the heavy, liquefied pig they called broth. On my recent visit, however, the Tao Kuro has disappeared from the menu (cue distressed agony). In its place, a previously \"special\" ramen, the bonito tonkotsu (pork bone with bonito fish) ramen appeared. Don't get me wrong, the unctuous, full-flavored bonito tonkotsu more than made up for the regular tonkotsu broth in Tao Kuro. I only wish they'd retained the thick, curly noodles, though. They stand up better to the heavy, commanding broth. The thin, straight, Hakata-style ramen noodles are just too wimpy for the bonito tonkotsu, although it was perfectly cooked as ordered. The thin noodles just don't let the thick broth cling to it. Bring back the thick, curly noodles! Also, the yuzu kosho (fermented chili & Japanese lemon paste) served on the edge of the bowl was an excellent touch, it brightened up the broth. I just wish there was more of it, maybe served as tabletop condiments?I noticed there were several new additions to the menu, too, but I had no stomach space to try them all. The drinks menu has also been revamped, adding more choices of cocktails.Service is always great (except for the sour lemon-sucking-faced Filipina girl), and prompt.",

And then when a customer leaves the restaurant, everyone also yells out thanking the customer in Japanese.

Organization of the queue is seriously inefficient. We thought that the island near the entrance was for people to chill while waiting once you get inside the restaurant (after queuing outside, mind you! - there's another queue INSIDE the restaurant -_-) but the waiting/queuing system leaves a lot to be desired. One particular staff member (should have gotten his name) didn't seem particularly happy with his job and was giving everyone a hostile attitude and face. So, you can tell that we didn't start off happy. Seriously, Ippudo, after all that I've heard about your restaurant, the least you can do is put a smiley happy staff member at the entrance! Ambience itself was ok, nice decor and furniture but music was being played too loud. Maybe it's just me but the music is completely unsuitable for a Japanese restaurant. And everybody was trying to speak at the top of their voices because they couldn't hear each other amidst the loud music. So, it sounded like a marketplace after a while. We ordered two ramen dishes and one rice dish. The unagi rice was surprisingly better than the ramen which is extremely average. It was a disappointment for me, as I honestly expected more after hearing about it. We also ordered the pork buns and the potato salad, both of which are nothing to shout about. Perhaps like some of the reviewers here, it's true when they say this place is too hyped up. They can't even beat the small, regular, generic ramen joints you find in Tokyo! Green tea is also non-refillable. So, that's a total rip-off, considering it costs as much as the glass of iced lemon tea. So, you might as well just order others, instead of the green tea! Now that I've finally had a taste of the food, seen the restaurant and experienced the service myself, I think I'll pass next time. Not worth the time you spent queuing outside (and in!) at all.",

While for repeat customers this might work well, as a first-time visitor to Itacho Sushi it's a cumbersome process. We had just landed in Singapore, and between two of us only had 10% battery on our phones. After a few issues downloading the app, we finally logged in to find a lot of items were (incorrectly) showing as 'sold out'. With only 30 mins to eat before an appointment, we asked the wait staff to please take our order themselves. A waitress pulled out her iPhone and was able to quickly take our order and send it to the kitchen. The food arrived and was good, however the customer experience was poor.

This makes a different to the taste as I have found in higher end sushi restaurants. Freshness of the seafood is also paramount & this place didn't disappoint. Where this restaurant needs to brush up on is their service. Or rather lack of it.

Ambience wise is noisy at the branch over at Ion & Doby Gaut, the queue is always very long and you have to wait for around 30 min. The queue at JCube is much better and not as noisy as well.

Quality and value of food is truly worth it but the portions are super small, we ordered about 6-8 portions of a food item for 4 of us. Service was excellent also, refilling out drinks and smiles. The only down thing for me is perhaps due to the small portion of food item, we had to order a lot more and some of our ordered items wasn\u2019t served and we had to re-order, so in between there\u2019s a bit of waiting time but overall I\u2019ll still recommend this for japanese cuisine lovers!",

Wish we hadn't.Service is friendly enough, but not particularly efficient, but it's the food that really disappoints. It's supposed to be a proper Japanese restaurant, and yet not one single dish would even have passed muster at a sushi train establishment - even the cheaper ones.Everyone knows that dishes never look as good as they are presented in the pictures provided, but Mitsuba really strains credibility in its offerings, that are so slapdash, and put together with so little care that, more often than not, they are almost unrecognisable. Sashimi was bog standard and not very fresh, and the cooked dishes bore more than a passing resemblance of having had a brief relationship with a microwave. Sure, they churn the food out fast, and you can eat as much as you like - so people with large appetites will probably find the experience decent value for money - but the quality of the food is embarrassingly poor.From the moment you enter the establishment you sense that something is not quite right. We witnessed 'chefs' paring vegetables next to an industrial dustbin; other 'chefs' unashamedly opening tins of food, and squeezing out sauces from bottles; dishcloths sitting about near food preparation areas; simply a total lack of care as to how the restaurant and the cooking process could be perceived by diners. The philosophy is obviously to get people in; feed them as much sub-standard food as they think they can eat; and get them the hell out of there, hopefully without noticing that no one involved in the restaurant could give a fig about quality control in any respect.A wonderful example of just how bad this place is: we ordered a pork katsu; it arrived cold. We sent it back. It arrived again (same dish!) having been 'nuked' - which meant that the accompanying sauce was now a veneer on the plate - totally dried out; completely inedible. That's the kind of care and attention you can expect, and complements the lack of respect this establishment accords to its food and its clientele.Oh, and the experience came to S$110 (with two beers - Asahi Black - very nice, but then they couldn't mess up opening a bottle) which is very poor value indeed.

With the price of more than $30 per head I would expect more variety and inclusive of sea urchin. Took a long time to serve dish with Mushroom and had to be reminded, albeit the staff bothered to check which specific dish was not yet served and served everything ordered finally. Worthy to note is that the menu offered good spread of appetizers, such as sliced tomatoes in japanese teriyaki sauce and fried tofu. Albeit appetizers came only after the main dishes have been served, which logically should be vice versa.But this place is definitely better than some big branded restaurant in Singapore in terms of price and quality of food. They are able to provide fresh Sashimi despite late into the opening hours (I came at 8pm, though the restaurant have been open since 6pm).The restaurant need to improve in their reception service: I came 15 minutes before my reservation time of 8pm but was told I can only get my seat on the dot. The restaurant had bothered to call me earlier to confirm my reservation then why not advise me to come on time as they will not serve me earlier.

However, at 7.30pm, a waitress came telling us that they were taking our last order and to be out by 8pm. This, as far as we know is only applicable to their buffet customers. Anyway, we orders a couple more dishes and while waiting, another waitress came to inform us that we could stay as long as we wanted to as we hadn't opted for their buffet. At 8pm, our orders had yet to come and when they finally did, as soon as we had finished eating, the first waitress came telling us that we were supposed to be out at 8pm and we had overshot the time. We explained to her what her colleague had told us and that our food hadn't even come by 8pm so how were we to leave?! She insisted she was right anyhow and we just told her we were already paying and going so let's not make a fuss. As we left, we realised how many empty tables were still available which begs the question as to why we were being rushed out. As for the food, the sashimi was nice and thick although not necessarily the freshest. Their cod mentaiki was a little on the fishy side and the chicken teriyaki tasted of refrigerated chicken (if you leave cooked chicken overnight in the fridge you'll get what I mean).

The century egg sauce was smooth and creamy. - Mentaiko Scallops: These were Hokkaido Scallops (with shell on) topped with a generous serving of mentaiko cream and grilled. I scooped up every bit of the mentaiko cream. - Mentaiko fresh Japanese Prawns: Prawns done the same way as above. Prawns were meaty and fresh. Nice.- Sashimi Moriwase: There was 6 types of sashimi and its good for 3 pax. Standouts were the fresh Hokkaido scallops which were soft and tasty. The salmon belly was also good. - Beef Nabe: This was the hotpot with beef slices. Its served with an assortment of vegetables, rice, Japanese pickles and an raw egg dip. The soup will come to a boil, and you take the beef out to dip into the beaten raw egg dip to \u2018cool\u2019 the beef slice down before eating it. This can be shared by two people and you can then order more stuff to eat!- Shake Aburi Maki: Salmon wrapped crab stick rice roll. The salmon is flame broiled before serving and I loved the nice fatty flavour when I bite into it. I ate 3 pieces of this. - Oyster shooter with a raw quail egg: A shucked fresh oyster placed in a shooter glass with a raw quail egg and soy sauce. swig it back and the oyster is so smooth and plump. Egg complemented the dish well.- Steamed Hokkaido Horsehair Crab: This is a seafood delicacy from Hokkaido that\u2019s popular here. Its cooked to order and served warm to the table. You break the legs and cut it up with the unique scissors that has a long and short blades. The legs are not so tasty while the body is more meaty and the parts with the crab roe were the tastiest. This was served with a ponzu dip and spicy daikon that has a hint of chilli padi. Packs a punch. Nice!- Sardine tatami and Fugu bak kwa: Grilled Sardine tatami and Fugu bak kwa. Loved it, especially when eating it with the Japanese mayonnaise on the side.- Soft shell crab: Nicely fried. Crispy and tasty. Paired well with the mayonnaise. I could eat this all by myself.- Spider Hand roll: I had this after the earlier dish. Satisfied my craving for the soft shell crab.- Asari clam in miso soup: Ended my meal (food-wise) with this soup. The clams imparted a sweetness to the soup, which had seaweed, tofu and miso in it. A nice end.We also had a sparkling yuzu sake, that\u2019s bubbly and easy to drink. The ladies in my group loved it. The restaurant has a good range of drinks (sake, soju, whisky, beer) that will cater to most people. I will be back again.",

There has been a total overhaul - management, signboard, menu, concept, aesthetics and feel. Mistuba Japanese Restaurant offers a la carte buffet dinner with over 130 dishes at merely SGD$36.90++ for adults and SGD$23.90++ for children.They started us with the Chirashi Sushi (assorted sashimi with sushi rice) - these lovely sets range from SGD$28.00 to SGD$68.00, and are served with a Miso Soup, an Otoshi (starter) and Fruits, making it a really worthwhile choice. The assortment of raw fish was all very thickly-sliced and fresh, bouncy in texture and tasty in their natural flavour. It was utterly delicious, especially for sashimi lovers like me.Then we had the Unatama Maki (SGD$16.00) - unagi (eel) and BBQ egg sushi roll; it was a splendid concoction that married the soft sweetness of the omelet and the slightly acidic flavor of eel into a successful gastronomical union.Next up, two of the most delicious items here - Ebi Mentaiyaki (SGD$18.00) and Hotate Mentaikayi (SGD$18.00) - prawns and scallops smeared generously with marinated roe of pollock and cod! Taste the saccharine flavours of the seafood amongst the rich, buttery coating of mentaiko, with ever the slightest hint of 'popping' crackling from the very tiny cod grains - every palate's dream.The festive promotion of Horse Hair Crab (SGD$38.00++) known as \"Kegani\" from Hokkaido and steamed perfectly and served with the Chef's secret recipe sauce, how could one resist this crab? The shell was full of fine hairs indeed, but rest assured the Chef has opened up the shell skillfully enough to keep it covered yet diners can pry the top shell open very easily. This juicy and saccharine dish left us raving, and there were plenty of flesh even within the hairy legs themselves.The Yuzu ice-cream was resplendant with the refreshing and citrusy qualities always associated with the fruit itself; there were even tiny pieces of yuzu peel within - the perfect conclusion to a sumptuous meal.For full review and more photographs, please refer here thanks:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-invite-dinner-at-mitsuba-japanese.html",

The quality of the components of the dishes looks great. The taste of it did not match up though. The pull pork was lacking in terms of flavour and it was one dimension. Others may like this style but we certainly did not. My friend's chicken rice bowl was tastier, chicken was cooked perfectly and it was well seasoned.

The rosti is stuffed with cheese, pan fried to a crisp exterior and served with fresh crabmeat pate and a perfectly poached eggs. The kaya mochi cheese french toast was a unique sweet-savoury dessert that boosted an interesting combination of kaya, mochi and cheese within two thick, soft and fluffy brioche.

The staff offered to change the meat to pork belly, hence I requested for the Char Siew Peekaboo's meat to be changed to pork belly. To my dismay, the staff said no?? Like huh, why not when it can be done for the other Char Siew dish?? Reluctantly she did it for me eventually. Anyway, the pork belly was pretty good, not too fatty and oily. Ate it together with the pickled lotus root as the lotus roots were too sour and a lil spicy. The Sakura ebi, however, added a special twist to the dish as a whole.

Warm matcha lava flowing down, the outer layer was crispy and soft at the same time that melted into our mouths right away.

The blandness of the cheese provided a nice balance to the sweetness of the matcha centre.The Tuna, however, has room for improvement. The soba was made from a different type of flour from the usual Japanese restaurants. Hence, it tasted different and was not able to absorb the eggyolk very well. Think they ran out of avocado that day, as I noticed it was replaced by lettuce. Would have been nice if I had been informed beforehand, as I ordered the dish partly for the avocado. Overall taste was cold, slimy and detached. On a positive note, the Tuna was cooked well.",
