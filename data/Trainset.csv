Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",OMG what a sushi experience 💯,50,3 October 2018,Had a quick impromptu business lunch and strolled in just after 1pm without a reservation. The service and reception was impeccable. The Chef ‍ what can I say. The very best I have come across in Singapore. Engaging the client in a meal with a running commentary and making the entire but brief 12 piece sushi lunch set all too brief but what a sushi ride . A little pricey but what an experience 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi,50,3 October 2018,"I have been to most Japanese restaurants in Singapore and i've been to Shinji several times, it is simply D best in my opinion. the service is impeccable, the ingredient used are of good quality and its sushi taste great. Although its on the higher end of the price scale, its worth at least one visit especially for special occasions."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistent ,50,21 September 2018,"You can never go wrong here. Always fresh, always friendly and excellent service. Michelin rated Chef."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth the money,50,19 September 2018,I had lunch with my colleague at the restaurant.We both ordered Chef Omakaze(don’t remember exactly but it was one of thier Omakaze).Their quality level of the foods are excellent and matter of fact it was too much food for me!We had some beers and highballs. Eventually we paid slightly over 1k Singapore dollar as total.They are expensive but worth the money.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but excellent vaule for lunch,50,30 August 2018,"Heard so much about this restaurant. Was invited there for lunch. It’s like walking into Japan. The decor was so authentic, so Japanese.Seated at the counter top which seats only 8 diners. So much to eat and the food was excellent. I was overblown by the freshness and the use of the chef’s sauce painted on the sashimi and sushi. The taste was mild and not over powering. The best dish was the humble tamago with tiny shrimps. The taste was so unique and great.Definitely recommended but mind the pocket."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi!,50,29 August 2018,"I went there for my birthday treat with my hubby.Please make reservation and get the counter seats!The chef will prepare every single sushi and serve directly to you piece by piece. He will only make the second piece once you ate the first piece.All very fresh ingredients, melt in the mouth.. you can opt for less rice too.They add surprise element by serving the birthday cake / dessert by turning off the light, singing the song, the chefs all wear masks (Japanese characters.one of them was Pikachu). Birthday hat and balloon... so cool!!Great place to celebrate special occasion and you can arrange surprise too!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Yet again a top notch sushi experience,50,16 August 2018,The best sushi restaurant in Singapore for me. Great to interact with the chefs and always special treat to be at head chef Oshino-san’s counter.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase birthday celebration,40,9 August 2018,"Celebrated my Fiance's birthday with Omakase Yume lunch sets at Carlton Hotel. It was a memorable gastronomical experience and we enjoyed every item prepared. Recommended to sit at the counter seats for omakase as it was interesting to watch how the Chef prepares each item. Ingredients were fresh and the layers of flavour were overwhelming! Every dish is a surprise. Service staffs are friendly and cheerful, and they prepared a small surprise for the birthday celebration. Total bill amount to $588 for 2 pax so I wouldn't say it is valued for money."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakasgasm,50,8 August 2018,"Highlight of my week is the Chefs Special. It’s literally flown from Tsukiji to your plate. It warms my heart when these badass n*ggas put gold leaf on my sushi.
Love x"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Don’t be stingy st Shinjii ,40,31 July 2018,"First time back since they moved from a Raffles to Carlton hotel; had the Chef’s Omakase. Of course, it’s extremely good, especially the cooked dishes. Somehow, I prefer the sushi at Ashino, and I find the uni rice bowl at Ki-sho more satisfying. But, at this level, differences are minimal and preferences are more a personal matter."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Next Level Omakase ,50,29 July 2018,"I was lucky enough to be entertained by a client who advised we would be doing Shinjuku at the Carlton Hotel. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and then directed to a smaller room. We then sat and did the Omakase menu. Our Japanese chef nailed all the courses, with everything perfect from the delicate fish to the warmth of the rice. He also recommended some off menu Sake which is from his home town. Was delicious. Looking forward to my next visit. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great place Great experience,50,21 July 2018,"We loved everything about the place, right from the entrance, the inner ambience, the highly hospitable staff, the delicious and mouth watering preparations.
Worth a revisit soon."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi done right,50,13 July 2018,"Located in the Carlton hotel. This place was very quiet despite hotel being busy. Really great quality produce, especially the tuna. I would recommend."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicious,50,9 July 2018,"Phenomenal sushi prepared by well trained professionals in a wonderful setting. One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever visited.
Not cheap but a great place to go for a treat.
Will definitely visit again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Hana lunch set,50,8 July 2018,Shinji isn’t cheap at all but I decided I just had to try it. The best way to do this without getting too badly gouged is through the Hana lunch set: 9 pieces of sushi for $75++. Service and food quality are excellent. I was able to walk in on a weekday without a reservation. I would love to try the more expensive options but will save that for a special occasion. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Fresh, delicious, omakase lunch from friendly 1 Star Michelin Shinji (Carlton Hotel, Singapore)",50,19 June 2018,"Boss brought two of us here as a surprise, during lunch. This is my second visit; previously, the chefs were at Shinji, Raffles Hotel.The size of the restaurant was just right and it was neither noisy nor quiet. Feel free to talk. Our chef paid attention to our conversations and chatted with us on some matters. We had an expensive omakase set - SGD 300 - this set included a plate with four types of uni, all of which were sweet. Chef informed us the order in which they should be consumed. The seafood was terrific in general. I enjoyed watching my chef press and shape the rice with seafood. I took numerous shots with my mobile and he was ok with that; he even smiled and mock-posed for me once !The dish with the monkfish liver was the best I had - lucky me, my boss gave me her portion. The monkfish came in two generous portions, and were served with a big slice of octopus, daikon with sea eel (I'm guessing from the pics because I can't remember), prawns or lobster and (this is what I enjoy most in Japanese fine dining) decorated with maple leaves and hydrangea.The last dish - fruits - included a generous (and expensive) sweet slice of honey dew and mango (also very expensive and very sweet).Altogether, a gorgeous lunch - great food, friendly chefs. Feel free to let them know you dislike certain tastes or smells - both my colleagues had them exclude wasabi and one of them asked them to hold back spring onions.If you have spare change, drop by Carlton Hotel Singapore for Shinji and enjoy the lovely Chihuly glass sculpture at hotel lobby."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Distinctive Japanese cuisine,50,19 June 2018,"Shinji by Kanesaka. Located at Lobby floor, Carlton Hotel, 76 Bras Basah Road, Singapore.The gateway of a wonderful marriage of distinctive Japanese cuisine serving a tantalising collection of dishes that will cater to every palate. Personal chef of the day will personally attend to about 8 diners, preparing busy at work master of sushi he expertly sliced out the fish, put on the sushi rice and finally, potter on the delicate seasonings, creating a very unique flavours. All the sushi I had tasted are very fresh and do not have even a hint of fishy smell, yet retaining the sweet, unique flavour of each own fish. The service is absolutely excellent, warm, friendly and genuine. One of the best services I had encountered. The place is unsophisticated, yet elegant, full of the Zen inspiration, filling one with tranquillity. I love this place I'll definitely be back!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A must for Sushi lover,50,20 May 2018,"One of the finest Omakase in Singapore my wife said that. Located in the ground floor, same as lobby of the Carlton Hotel, it provides both private room as well as share table over the counter where the Chef prepare each and every bite of your sushi & Sashimi. My wife ordered a small set, 15 pieces, Omakase cost $ (Singaporian) 220 cuz she's a small lady. The Chef was very kind to cutdown the size of rice in each sahimi underneath the superb and fresh various kind of fish such as Uni, Akami,O Toro, Ama-E bi, Shima-Aji, and others which we did not know the exact Japanese name. My wife told Chef that she loves white-meat-fish and he tried to give her more so. The meal was superb and worth the price. Strongly recommended if you are sushi lover. Will definitely come back !"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh sushi and very nice service!!!,50,20 May 2018,I came here with my friend and i love this place because of food and service. Everything here was superb. I will come back with my family next time.Thanks you everything. Highly recommend if you need sushi in Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Japanese in Singapore,50,18 May 2018,"On a recent visit through Singapore and a birthday treat for a local, I and a friend dined at Shinji by Kanesaka at the Carlton Hotel.The atmosphere was lively yet relaxing.The restaurant had separate rooms for group.We shared a section with 4 other couples.We chose the mixed sashimi and sushi menu, fixed price around $300 per head plus a small Sake recommended by the host.The food was sublime.It was prepared for us by the master's chef in front of us.Every dish was an explosion of flavour, singing of the sea.The sea urchin roe was unctuous and luscious, washed down with the light and fragrant Sake.A superb night and fit for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sashimi and sushi nigri ever,50,12 May 2018,"Amazing experience. I have never had such a great japanese dinner. To celebrate this excellent meal, I have a photo of me as a Sumo fighter and my wife as a fish but I will spare you that. Many thanks to the great team at Shinji by Kaneska"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi lover must try,50,28 April 2018,"We came here because it's located inside St Regis where we stayed. Our friends already told us this is one of the best Japenese restaurants in Singapore. We sat at the sushi counter facing our chef. We then ordered one Omakase & one sushi lunch with a bottle of sake recommended by the chef. Everything was so perfect with delicious food. The sashimi & sushi were all very fresh. I love the dessert which was a rice cracker shell with green tea ice cream, Very comfortable atmosphere & the guests including us just focused on the food well prepared by our chefs. It's pricey but we got what we paid for: quality food, excellent chef, perfect service and nice/quiet ambience. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Extremely good, but atmosphere and wooden chopsticks",40,31 March 2018,"No complaints about the food,perfect! Missing is though a bit of atmosphere it’s just empty rooms with chairs doesn’t help creating a good conversation. For a Michelin star restaurant having wooden chopsticks...."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,50,26 March 2018,"Extremely happy to have dined here. The staff were superb, very attentive and helpful. The chef was just a delight. Happy to chat while he worked. And what a master he was - it is so incredible to watch a true craftsman.But the food - well you will not find fresher or better tasting anywhere. If you are a Japanese food lover then this one is for you. Yes it is expensive, don't think you will get much change out of $1,200 - but you really must try it at least once in your life."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wow wow wow,50,20 March 2018," Not sure where to start. We had an amazing experience at Shinji by Kanesaka. The food is absolutely amazing, the private rooms with your own chef makes this an culinary feast. The sushi and sashimi is made to perfection. A perfect place to any special occasion."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Honeymoon sushi,50,25 February 2018,"When investigating restaurants for the start of our Honeymoon in Singapore, one stood out from the crowd - Shinji at The Carlton hotel, why.......The promise of an intimate and authentic sushi experience - we were not disappointed!We left the dish decision to our sushi master chef Oshino and boy did he deliver, from the three different ages and types of tuna to the two different types sea urchin, every dish was incredible to look at let alone taste.Watching the master himself, chef Oshino, was a true honour, the preparation of every dish was a joy to watch, so meticulous and precise.Our visit totally changed our opinion on sake, the choice was overwhelming but the waiting staff helped us with the perfect choice.We left feeling truly spoiled and that we had experienced a truly magical culinary experience.Some people say that Shinji is too expensive, I say you get what you pay for and we got culinary excellence and one hell of an evening.We will be back - we just do not know when."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A inviting and exquisite experience,50,23 February 2018,"After trying Kanesaka in Tokyo, I was stoked to find out there was one in Singapore, and offering cheaper options. The chef recommended we take the $125 course if we liked uni (originally we came for the $75), and we were not disappointed! The chef we had was jovial and friendly, and it's apparent the chef has loyal regulars by the way they interact, which is good to see! We we in a smaller room, but it didn't detract from the experience. I would definitely take others there the next time! Quality of the food almost as good as the Tokyo Palace Hotel branch!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lunch date ,50,22 January 2018,"As always, my fav is Japanese food and my hubby took me to Shinji@raffles hotel. We went for the full set meal. Their serving was very generous and lots of variety. Their service was great and their chef even wore some funny mask to entertain the customers. Finds their service personal. Excellent food and excellent service "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Omakase Japanese Cuisine,50,7 January 2018,"Excellent omakase Japanese Cuisine served by team of artisan chef.. rest assured that you will be served the freshest ingredients and beautifully presented.. Delight your palate and will definitely keep you busy taking pictures.. a great place for Japanese Cuisine lover, and hosting your guests.  Michelin ⭐️"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore,50,31 December 2017,"Amazing selection of nigiri sushi. Excellent cuts of fish that are perfectly seasoned, paired with warm, moist and vinegar flavoured rice! The tamago here is sweet, soft and outstanding too! Service is friendly with lots of attention to detail. Each visit is a trip to sushi heaven!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Yummy Japanese ,40,18 December 2017,"A busy Japanese restaurant that looks like a favorite among locals. The sushi/sashimi is very fresh. For dessert, I loved their green tea ice cream."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fabulous sashimi/ sushi (at a price),40,28 November 2017,A great experience if you are a fan of sashimi/ sushi (including cuttlefish sperm & monk fish liver!). Undeniably fabulous sashimi and sushi; also undeniably expensive. We went on a Monday evening when there were not many diners and the sushi bar was lacking in atmosphere. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi restaurant ,50,25 November 2017,"Great experiences
Fresh
Innovative
Best sushi
Excellent service
It was in Raffles hotel in the before and removed here in Apr 2017.
The table is made from special wood - 220 years old. It is of one piece wood."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Totally Recommend it! ,50,9 November 2017,Fish is super fresh and delicious!The staff is really nice and accesible. They will not give you what you ask them not to and they will substitute your pieces with something else instead of just not giving anything to you like other omakase places. The sake was one of the best I've ever had! Totally recommend this place! 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excelent,50,7 November 2017,Excelent but very expensive. Intimate. Best for special ocasions. Food great quality. Sake perfect. Reservation required for saturday evening.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing sushi,50,18 October 2017,"Traveling regularly to Japan, it has always been difficult to find the same taste in Singapore.But this time, I have found it!What a fantastic omakase prepared by the whole team is sushi masters.It was like a short trip to Japan during a dinner. THE sushi place in Singapore"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi of my well traveled life,50,7 October 2017,"Nothing can compare to this experience. About 10 seats and at least 4 chefs working in front of you creating traditional exotic Japanese artful, precise, wonderful food. Each mouthful amazing. Each serving on beautiful special plates, every creation made with a ballet-like movement between chef and fish."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE sushi bar,50,22 September 2017,"One problem there is with this place - it annuls all the sushi you've eaten before. Unless you've been to a similar establishment in Japan or Hong Kong (let's face it, the chances are low), Shinji is going to be your maiden genuine sushi experience. We felt literally like savages being civilized here. You eat nigiri sushi several seconds after they were prepared.You don't handle soy sauce and wasabi - it's for the chef to decide the sauces in what you're eatingWe had a set consisting of a starter, 14 nigiri sushi, miso soup with sakura shrimp and a dessert. And that were definitely the best ones we ever had. Different kinds of tuna, needle fish, sea urchin roe, shrimp and all. The place is a real eye opener on what a proper sushi is."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Don't take the kids!...,50,6 September 2017,"The decor here is Tokyo authentic and the fish direct from the Tokyo fish market (literally). As you could expect the Sushi is unbelievable!!However, with a $200, $300 or $500 price per head, it's not a cheap nite out.The only goods news is that the wine is quite affordable (by comparison).Loved it tho. And I'm going back for the $500 meal (but won't take the kids)."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing jap sashimi/sushi,50,4 September 2017,"Had the Omakase and the 9piece set for both of us.
Probably the best tuna sashimi i have eaten (i dare say even better than the ones we tried in Osaka at kurumon ichiba market!)
Ended with nice birthday surprise from the chefs!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wonderful experience ,50,30 July 2017,Had an Omakase lunch at Shinji. We were time constrained so we requested the sashimi and sushi. The sashimi and sushi were impeccable. Wonderfully fresh and melted in the mouth. The pickled ginger was also excellent - most unusual texture and flavour. Service was discreet and excellent. An expensive experience but worth it. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicacy ,50,26 July 2017,For the first time of my life I finished all the gingers and probably the most I have ever had! Friendly waitress kindly answered my question about the finger wipe. The sushi is just amazing. Would be better if the chef presents them with more languages than Japanese. In the end I'm just not full...
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Heavenly Chutoro,50,20 July 2017,Starts with sashimi and cooked stuff and ends with sushi. The chutoro (semi fatty tuna) is the best I ever tasted!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but....,40,17 July 2017,"The fish are fresh, the uni rice with caviar is excellent. The service is ok( some younger waitress are a little unsure. Ambience is same as any sushi place.
Prices are higher than Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Tokyo Standard Japanese Sushi in Singapore,50,13 July 2017,"It had moved to Carlton hotel some time ago & this was the first time we went there, & we had the OMAKASE for our dinner. It has a seating for 12 at the counter, & three more tables at the side & a private room; obviously u need to make an advance booking if you want to get a counter seat. This is the place to go in S'pore if you demand same high quality Sushi as you would get at those high end Sushi Restaurants in Japan, so be prepared to pay a hefty premium."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore,50,23 June 2017,Very good sushi served at a counter or in small private rooms. Expensive but the quality of produce is telling. 1 michelin star is a fair rating and this is easily one of the top 3-5 sushi restaurants in Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Serious Sushi in a Traditional Setting,50,7 May 2017,"Special night if you like Sushi as we do as we made our way through the tasting menu and then more. Beautifully prepared, served and accompanied with sake and wine."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The standard,50,7 May 2017,"Despite many high end Japanese restaurants in Singapore, and the many hype and stars associated with them, I felt that Shinji is the one that still sets the standard of Edomae sushi. It is a pure culinary experience.My wife and I visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration and we chose the counter seats for better interaction with the chef and energy of the surrounding.We left our evening with the chef to take us through the wonderful Omakese journey he had prepared for us. It's difficult to explain in full the amazing favor of each ingredients and how they intertwined with each other. It's the skills and arts combined at work, and the respect that the chef had on the ingredients. This reminded us of the beautiful sushi experience in Tokyo and Otaru.We also ordered a bottle of chilled sake as recommended, it went very nicely with the dishes; we decided to order another serving and shared with the chef and staff as an appreciation.The ambiance was zen and minimalistic, soothing to the eye and body. At the counter in our evening we had mainly Japanese diners, giving the experience an authentic feel.It's a memorable evening and one that will remain in our mind for a long time."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Poor Marketing Collaboration,30,21 April 2017,"i have dined at Shinji at Raffles 3 times before, so on invitation of UOB Bank, I have my dinner this time at the Carlton location. I was reminded by my bank manager it's a $300 pp dinner menu, so I look forward to another great experience at Shinji.But I was very disappointed by the outcome, dishes served may have still maintained the standard, but I was surprised that I didn't get a slice of Toro and total dishes served were much lees that lunch in a cheaper menu.On my way out, I questioned the staff on my doubts that the menu worth $300pp, she quickly show me the menu starting price at $300pp, but I asked her why no Toro, no certain hot dishes I used to get etc, she was unable to comments as this is a marketing agreement with the bank etc.Actually I already suspected this kind of marketing dinner will be a modified menu though they claimed at certain price menu. My disappointment is that a premium Michelin star restaurant should not participate such kind of event, but if chose to do it, should serve the exact menu offering as usual but not modified it.Also the Chef is not as sociable as other top end sushi place like Hashida."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Same good quality. More seats,50,10 April 2017,"Oshino-san was in his element, whipping out seasonal highlights with his affable personality & adorable wife as chief waitress clad in a brand new kimono, apparently from material given by her mum. Food was as usual sublimely exquisite. More seating capacity also meant higher din when diners get excited in their conversations. Interesting place to people watch as well. From the corporate types to singularly focused Japanese connoisseur just content with the pleasure of eating fresh sashimi."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding Japanese food,50,7 April 2017,"I love Japanese food so I decided to treat myself when I was working in Singapore (why not?). Shinji seems to offer two sittings for lunch and the restaurant is very intimate with seating around the bar so you watch the chefs work. Perfect.I arrived for my lunch to a warm greeting and a stool for my bag. I decided to have the 'chef's surprise' whereby the chef prepares a number of different dishes for you, including hot dishes, and a selection of sashimi and sushi. I can only describe the meal as exceptional. I loved watching my sushi being prepared for me individually, the quality was incredible. The other dishes were works of art on a plate and were just as outstanding as the other dishes.I started taking notes of what I was eating so I could tell my other half when I got home but stopped after the fourth dish and just savoured the whole experience.This was an expensive treat to myself but it was one that I will always remember. I fully intend to return next time I'm in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",UNI RICEEEEE,40,27 February 2017,"Had the omakase for 2.
Every sushi/dish tasted great. Definitely worth the experience.
Ended the omakase with the best melt in your mouth uni rice ever!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Edomae Sushi in Singapore,50,6 February 2017,"Best Sushi restaurant in Singapore, period.. Having tried a number of popular sushi restaurant (be it with michelin stars or not), this one takes the crown for Singapore best at this Raffles hotel branch. Get the sushi counter and make advance reservation. And go for lunch for cheaper menu option. You can't go wrong with any menuFood = 5 stars, service = 5 stars.. Price, definitely reflect the quality offered"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good Edomae sushi tasting menu albeit pricey,40,23 January 2017,"Really good sushi restaurant and great service. We had the Edomae menu which had 15 sushi options with a hefty price tag of S$220. The sea urchin and chutoro were particularly excellent, but the horse mackerel could be better and the temperature of the rice was inconsistent. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Deserves even more stars,50,20 January 2017,If I could give a sushi restaurant 10 stars this would be the place --innovative tasty and as much as you can eat in one meal. Best sushi I have had anywhere on the globe
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but expensive for what it is,30,8 January 2017,This was my 2nd visit. 1st time was 2013. Whilst I enjoyed the meal I felt it wasn't the same as the first time.... perhaps different chefs.? The service was a bit cold and I didn't find the chef engaging. Food was good but not as good compared to the likes of hashida or shoukouwa. Pricey for what it is I think.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",outstanding,50,30 December 2016,"There is not a better Japanese restaurant in Singapore, this place is incredible in terms of food quality, service at the counter watching the chef's prepare and in terms of a lunch time price (apparently it's double in the evening so go for lunch!).Excellent in terms of impressing a client or a girl the delivery of one item at a time really enables you to fully enjoy the experience while still having great conversation. They have it sorted. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Intimate and Superb!,50,24 December 2016,"This discrete restaurant on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel is widely considered to serve the best sushi in Singapore and we were not disappointed! We enjoyed the $225 US omakase at a 10 person sushi bar in a private room in the back of the restaurant. It consisted of more than a dozen courses of some cooked, but mostly raw dishes and everyone was both a visual and a culinary delight. Excellent service and a thoughtful and fairly-priced sake list rounded out the experience. Expensive but a must stop for any serious sushi lover visiting Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Our experience ,20,21 December 2016,"The food in the restaurant is good but way too pricey for the quality of service they have. For the shrimp sashimi chef showed us dead and old shrimps saying that they are fresh and joking that they are ""sleeping"". We asked to replace them for fresh ones, however chef just pretended that he changed them, apparently thinking that we are fools. In the meantime, we have been to Nobu, Zuma snd other upscale restaurants which serve japanese/fusion food. We asked him again to change the shrimps and he replied that it is our fault because we got late for our sitting (the sitting was at 9 and we came there by 9:15). Later, we asked to replace this shrimp sashimi for other sushi, and the restaurant included it in the bill as ""extra"". The last and final was the desert (fruit) which was half portion in comparison to what the other customers got, who ordered the same set. Apparently it was also because we got 15 min late. Altogether we paid 750 SGD. No comments. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE perfect japanese restaurant outside japan,50,10 December 2016,"outstanding and authentic japanese food of the very highest quality! pricy yes, but its worth every penny!! seeing the chefs preparing your sashimi and sushi dishes is a delight, again, outstanding!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best sushi meal I have ever had outside Japan,50,25 November 2016,We sat at the bar with chef preparing the meal in front of us. They onoy have 3 set price menues and not a la carte. We chose the middle menu ($300 per person) and were not disappointed.We decided to go to town on the budget and ordered a bottle of Champagne to drink with our meal.This was the best Sushi meal we have ever had outside Japan. Worth every penny.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top of the line sushi,50,23 October 2016,"We were there to celebrate our 25 th wedding anniversary. In a small room with 8 seats, chef Ishizawa showed his talents in 2 hours. Everything in the restaurant except water was brought from Japan. Every bit we tasted was so fresh and tasty. Sea urchin from Hokkaido was spectacular, I had not tasted such a good sea urchin even in Japan. The sake menu was quite good. The chef is a very nice person full of humor :) The price is quite high but it is worth eating at least one time in a lifetime.."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",First class.,50,17 October 2016,Located on second floor of the Raffles hotel. Fantastic sushi and sashimi. The cold sake was super.Reccomended.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Japanese but can be $$$$$,50,1 October 2016,"Went for dinner with a group of 5 at the Shinji, Raffles hotel. We took the smaller rooms which can occupy up to 8 pax. Ideal for group and also cosy. Food was great and fresh sashimi. We took omekashi set dinner and cost a lot with 2 bottles of sake. It was recently crowned with 1 star Michelin and expect the food and service at the TOP notch. Expensive but worth a try ."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,50,30 September 2016,"Absolute fantastic sushi, prepared and beautifully presented by knowledgeable, dedicated experts. Not cheap - but the quality justifies the price."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing 1 Michelin Star Sushi in Singapore,50,29 September 2016,"Located on the second level of the Raffles Hotel, Shinji sushi offered me an amazing authentic Japanese gourmet experience. I was there with my fiancee for a casual lunch. We ordered Hana (flower) set-lunch. The 9 pieces meal was definitely enough to fill your stomach. The chef prepared the freshest ingredients in front of us and he’d proportioned the size of the sushi rice so that you’d have the best experience without feeling either hungry or bloated at the end of the meal. We were really impressed by the gold flakes mocha dessert at the end."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase-Wow,50,26 September 2016,"One of the top 5 dining experiences I have had. A Michelin star should tell you what you need to know and this restaurant is as good as the the top Omakase restaurants in Ginza.Chef Ishizawa presents and endless flow of fresh Japanese delicacies over about a 2 hour period. I am not a huge sea urchin (Uni) fan but Chef presented several types from Hokkaido and I was amazed.The grilled tuna was also out of this world as Chef selects a heavily marbled cut and the fish is tender and juicy throughout.One caution: If you have to ask about pricing, this is not your restaurant."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive sushi. Bespoke service.,40,18 September 2016,"I'll start off by saying that at 250 ++ (around $300) per pax, this was probably one of the most expensive lunch i've ever had in my life (without alcohol). Made a reservation for 2 person for a weekday lunch, and was promptly seated at the table by a Japanese lady. Service was really good and there was a personal chef to cater to the 8 customers that were seated at my table (including myself). Ordered the Omakase (a.k.a Yume) set. It started off with some sea urchins as appetizers followed by a series of maybe 7-8 sashimi. Each of the sashimi served was pretty fresh, but my partner and myself were both slightly dissapointed that they didn't serve use Chutoro (i.e. fatty tuna) for the price we paid. (perhaps we had too high an expectation). Desert was some cake, nothing too special though.Overall, Lunch was okay, it wasn't too filling. The chef was pretty cool, sharing information on the food that we were served and the origins of the seafood etc. Reminds me of the time when I was at Sushi Dai (Tsukiji market, Tokyo), where the Japanese chef was similarly very keen to share more about the Japanese culture. All in all, based on my experience observing what the other guests were having, I think that the 12 or 15 pieces of sushi is of better value than the Omakase (they are about $100 cheaper).Definitely do check out this place if you are looking at high-end Japanese cuisine in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you like sushi you must go to Shinji,50,14 September 2016,"Located at the Raffles hotel, we went there not knowing what to expect, once we got there and saw a small restaurant we knew the experience was gonna be epic.If you come to Shinji you know you will get the best sushi in town..100% fresh!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding!,50,13 September 2016,"My husband and I were celebrating a special occasion and decided on Shinji @ Raffles Hotel for lunch at the sushi counter on a Saturday in September and were not disappointed. We have previously dined at several Michelin star restaurants in Japan, and were keen to try Shinji. We ordered the 12 piece sushi course. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi and sashimi and thought it was first class. The fish melted in the mouth and the rice was served at room temperature. Although wasabi was available, we followed the chef's lead and didn't add any more to our plates. The 12 piece course was sufficient for us. Attentive service in filling our drinks when required (we had champagne). We brought our 11 month old daughter and the staff were courteous and friendly to her too. She didn't eat but enjoyed the experience and attention from the friendly wait staff. While not a fault of the restaurant, I was surprised to see and felt a bit disappointed for the chef and staff that a fellow diner (who was by himself) was dressed very casually in shorts and t-shirt and ate entire meal with head phones on and looking at his phone. All in all, a wonderful experience and would eat here again for a special occasion!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good sushi,50,11 September 2016,"Last year I went to Hashida sushi, and this year to Shinji. I think both restaurants are equally good. At Shinji my husband and I ordered the Hana set and the Omakase special for lunch. Total bill was about $380+. Sushi is very good, though the pieces seem to be smaller than what I had in Tokyo. I remember that in Tokyo the pieces of fish are much larger than the rice underneath. Here in Shinji the fish and the rice are about the same size.Overall, it is a very good dining experience with excellent service. Though I don't think it is value for money if you compared with what you can get in Tokyo."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Good sushi, but a shocking experience",30,2 September 2016,"I strongly feel that I have to voice this out to warn potential patrons/customers. As much as I love and adore Shinji based on my 2 previous visits, what I encountered today is just unacceptable. As I had a heavy breakfast, I decided to opt for the 9-piece Hana lunch set menu. The head chef then went on to ask me if I like Uni (sea urchin) and said it's currently the Uni season, so the 12-piece set which includes Uni might be better for me. I replied yes, I do like Uni but today I'm feeling slightly full, so just the 9-piece set will do. Then he said 'Okay, I'll make smaller portions of the rice for you.' Thinking that it's just a kind gesture from the chef, I proceeded with my lunch. Slowly, 8 pieces of sushi were served and to my surprise, I was served Uni for the 9th piece. I knew something wasn't right. In the end, I was served 12 pieces of sushi when I have opted for 9 and yup I was charged $125++ for the 12-piece set lunch.Don't get me wrong, the sushis were brilliant, worthy of the michelin star, but I'm not sure if this behaviour is acceptable. So, the next time you decide to have lunch at Shinji, maybe repeat your order so the Chef gets it right, I don't know."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",First class!,50,31 July 2016,"Dinner for 4 with Japanese guests in a private room. Set menu. Great variety, every course fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Even the cold sake was outstanding.
Excellent service throughout. My guests and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Very expensive, but worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply Amazing Experience,50,30 July 2016,"With the recent Michelin star introduction in Singapore, this is the 1st restaurant with a Michelin star that i visited. I went to another Michelin star restaurant the next day and by comparison, food is so much fresher and delicious, ambiance is quiet yet cosy, and the attentiveness of the chef and waitresses were a class up.There are 3 dinner sets to choose from $220 to $450. I had the $300 Omakase Wa. It was the most filling and satisfying Japanese dinner in Singapore.The set consists of appetiser, assorted sashimi, assorted cooked dishes, nigiri sushi and maki sushi, Soup and Japanese fruits. All the seafood were of course as fresh as it gets. The chef was skillful in his craft and my friend and I had the chef to ourselves till middle of our meal when a couple came in. I guess the chef made most of the experience in this restaurant memorable. A small portion of the jelly dropped on the table. After i finished the whole jelly, he took a piece of tissue, leaned forward, said a word of sorry, and cleaned off the jelly on my table. Most people would think the chef's main role is to make good food but in this fine restaurant, the effort and attentiveness of the chef was amazing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good Sushi ,50,23 July 2016,I lived 5 years in Tokyo and this Place is definitely up to Par with good places in Tokyo. Highly recommended. Will go again.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best Meal of My Life - WOW, thanks Yoshi (Sunsuke Yoshizawa - Head Chef)",50,12 July 2016,"I was incredibly luck to get invited by a business colleague to try Shinji at Raffles. To be honest, other meals at Raffles have been unremarkable, to Shinji was truly impressive. I am also lucky I did not have to pay, the bill was over $1100 Sing for two people. We were stuffed and had two bottles of high-grade sake. The sushi was pure amazing and Head Chef Yoshi was great and incredibly attentive. Not so sure I would want to spring for a $600/person dinner, but it was one of the finest meals of my life."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town,50,28 June 2016,"We have been to Shinji by Kanesaka for several occasions and every time, the food was excellent. Though pricey, the quality of the fish is well worth the money. If you want to have a once in a lifetime sushi experience while in Singapore, choose the chef's menu and enjoy the freshest fish in town."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Big Bang, lotsa buck",50,26 June 2016,"Tucked away in a discreet corner of an opulent western hotel is this magical enchanting gem of a sushi restaurant. Quiet, understated, discreet. Perfect. Great great great food at the counter. Multiple courses of Japanese seafood delicacies, each more subtle, more intricate than the last. Awesome sushi made in front of your seats, seeing and delivery all part of the charm. Marvellous. Not for the budget conscious. $800 sg for two was not a big spend here so save the pennies! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Undisputedly good sushi,50,20 June 2016,"Our sushi experience here has set the bench mark for future endeavours!Service was superbly good. Hot teas were promptly refilled, the placement of the ginger on the serving plate was switched upon finding out that my husband was a leftie, and not forgetting the hilarious party get-up that the chefs adorably put on to sing both of us a birthday song! Plus points there!The food was amazingly good (even better than the ones we had in Japan). The uni sushi was so creamy that it melts and slides down your throat.We understand from the chef that they fly in the fishes from Tsukiji market 4 times a week! Freshness guaranteed!To Chef Takahiro Ishizawa and his team, thank you so much!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very authentic sushi experience in singapore,50,13 June 2016,"I think out of all the premium sushi restaurants in Singapore, this is one that match up to Tokyo micheline sushi restaurant.
Omakase is worth the money!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town!,50,19 May 2016,"We have heard and read so much about this place so had high expectation. We were not disappointed.This was by far the best sushi I have had in my life! Every ingredient flown in fresh from Japan, every piece prepared with great care and attention. Not to mention the superb taste!Every single piece was perfection in a mouthful. What more can I say!I would definitely be back!Personally I preferred sushi over the omakase, which my husband had, but that is just personal preference. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing experience,50,6 May 2016,"Excellent place to try authentic Japanese cuisine!

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi outside of Japan,50,13 March 2016,"After several deliberations with other close contenders in Bangkok, I have concluded Shinji as the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. The decision is based on taste and serving practice by the chef, and Shinji is my winning choice. Value is also pretty reasonable - though price can be perceived on the high side, the quality, ingredients, and amount of courses offered makes it very justified. You finish your meal on a high note - satisfied with such unmatched flavors and undeniable freshness with attentive service, having an overall satisfaction on dollars well spent.Shinji would be the number 1 nominated choice if looking for the highest quality sushi outside Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",An excellent sushi-ya experience,50,22 January 2016,"Had a lovely meal at Shinji by Kanesaka. My sister had pre-booked the Omakase Shin menu - their premium Omakase menu beforehand and so we did not have to make any choices for our dinner. The pacing of the meal was excellent as we had a little private room to ourselves. We were served a variety of appetisers including the infamous shirako (cod's milt) which was a very interesting eating experience indeed! Our chef for the night was very accommodating with all our requests - for example, when my sister mentioned that she found the wasabi very strong, he made sure that her portion of sushi contained less wasabi. Overall, a very expensive dinner but one which was worth every penny."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best Omakaze in Singapore,50,20 January 2016,"Its my second time to try Omakaze in shinji.Its surely one of my favourite restaurant when i visit singapore.Shinji has the most japanese chef that i've seen in singapore.Their sashimi is very fresh, just like Tsukiji market in tokyo.Must book as they are fully packed."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sashimi and sake,50,6 January 2016,Need to make a reservation to come here. We were ordered 2 types of omakase. Both were so good. Sashimi were so fresh and sake was really good. Chef and staff so friendly
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not my best Omakase,30,16 December 2015,"3rd omakase experience. Came with high expectation because of good reviews I've heard. The sushi and ingredients were certainly very fresh, but freshness is the basic expectation of any Japanese cuisine in my opinion. In terms of artistic presentation, it was mediocre. Taste wise, every dish was good but did not bring me to heaven. Still, Hide remains top on my list. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wow-what an experience! ,50,14 December 2015,All we ordered was absolutely delicious. Very talented young chef. We were amazed with every bite! High quality tuna!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite artwork in food!,50,12 December 2015,"Shinji has some of the best sushi, if not the best sushi I have ever had. The ishi knows what they are doing and concentrate on the task at hand with great precision.
It is pricey but my goodness it's worth it!!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lost sushi.,20,7 December 2015,"I have had the opportunity to try many fine sushi establishment so my review is base on peer to peer comparison. I had high expectations for Shinji but my friend and I were underwhelmed, the fish was fresh although my mackerel had a very strong smell which was distracting. Second, the cut of the fish was wrong. You should be able to chew the fish and not have their tendons spent stuck on your teeth. My friend had to ask for tissue to spit out the tuna which she could not chew. This was unacceptable already. Third, the rolls were not appetizing to your sight. The toro was falling apart. My tuna maki was not cut cleanly and worse of all, rice was stuck outside of the roll. This is something you would expect from the third grade sushi place but not one of this caliber. Fourth, the rice was not delicious. It was not fragrant nor was it warm. When you visit a fine sushi establishment it is usually not the fish that you should be mesmerized by, but for me it is the rice. Shinji did not inspire me. There was no passion in the plating, or care for ingredient. It was as if I went to one of those popular restaurants who know that they are popular and took their eyes off the quality. My plate was never cleaned, the fish was cut recklessly, and overall shameful example of what it should be."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible - The Best!!,50,29 November 2015,"Having read numerous reviews I was worried by expectations would be too high and would be left disappointed after dining. I was so wrong! Even with the highest of expectations Shinji managed to surpass them. A great meal, friendly and knowledgeable service staff (ask them anything and I bet they will know) and beautiful environment. I will be back !"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SUSHI EXPERIENCE,50,25 November 2015,"This is very classic, simple, absolutely delicious sushi. No mayonnaise based sauces here. At times the sushi master studied the piece of fish looking for the exact way to cut it (this was not a show) and precises placed droplets of soy or juice to the exact spot on the fish."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing,50,20 November 2015,"We had dinner at Shinji at Raffles Hotel a couple of weeks back, and it was nothing short of amazing. The sashimi was so fresh, especially the uni, it took us right back to Endo Sushi at the Osaka Fish Market. Dishes that came with sauces were delicately and thoughtfully put together and tasted absolutely heavenly. We had some sake to go with it, and that was delicious too. Finally, the seasonal fruits (and ice cream) that they served at the end of dinner were also of the finest quality. All in all, a gastronomically pleasurable experience.Service was of course, impeccable. We also appreciated how game the chefs were to dress up as they brought out the fruit platter, complete with candles, and sang happy birthday to just about all of us (just happened that 5 of the 6 couples at dinner that night were either celebrating an anniversary or a birthday). We would love to return again and share this experience with our friends and loved ones."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elevated my standards ,50,14 November 2015,Shinji elevated my standards of what to expect for a premium Omakase. At these prices (300SGD/person) there is a high likelihood of being let down. There was not a single flaw. Each very attentively prepared and served piece better than its weaker versions I have had in LA. You won't be let down
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply amazing,50,4 November 2015,Tried the new Shinji at the St Regis last month. Was so impressed by it and was dying to try the original at Raffles hotel. Got to say they are both stunning. Without doubt the best sushi in town. The counter service is very personal as well with the chefs keen to entertain and engage. It is pricey but it is the place to impress clients and special ones.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Perfection ,50,1 November 2015,One of the best sushi i have ever ate. Sashimi and nigiri were divine. Not cheap at all but was worth it all- sea food was very high quality.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great place ,50,31 October 2015,Sushi bar. The entire family and extended clan decided it was one of the best sushi joints around. The sushi and sashimi were just very good. Do ask for their short-fin uni which was sweeter and really nice. Great service as well. It is cheaper during lunch rather than dinner. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",tokyo class sushi,40,26 October 2015,very high standard but expensive but it gets the job done! it's all sushi and best to have the omakase
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Thank you Chef Ishi ! See you soon,50,24 October 2015,"The Chef Ishi do is best and more so that you spent a memorable evening.And it is the case.Sushi seems today very simple because very popular but a real sushi it is very complicate and so rare !Here eveything is perfection. The choice and the quality of fishs, the cutting of those one and the slightly tepid rice basing in mouth.But I have to deliver an important message. This place is for Wealthy Connaisseurs. WHY ?Because they are probably the best sushis that I ate ever all arround the world including Japan. But the excellence has a price !.It is thus necessary to have a developed palace if you wish to keep a fantastic memory at the time of the bill ($ 800.- for 2)I'll go back"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best ever,50,18 October 2015,We went to Shinji for lunch and I must say it was one of the best Japanese food I ever had. The sushi is prepared individually with the freshest fish.

This is my first dinner at this original raffles hotel branchThe menus are the same between Regis and raffles. Opted for the Wa menu again , the middle oneA procession of gorgeously prepared food came. The sushi and sashimi are all divine. The cooked food like miso cod etc. are also of a much higher standard than elsewhere Sake prices are not sky high There was a couple celebrating their anniversary and the chefs put on their funny masks and broke into song. Always so hilarious when they do that. Wonderful "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Impressive meal,50,6 October 2015,Every piece of nigiri was excellent. Each piece of seafood was of the highest quality. Absolutely delicious

Attentive sushi chef who's obviously out to please. Every dish of the degustation menu was splendid in taste and presentation. Couldn't have asked for better. Pricey, memorable sushi."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply great,50,20 September 2015,"Definietly one of the best sushi restaurant in Singapore. All the dishes - not only sushi - are simply delicious. Needless to say, a bit pricy but considering the location and the cost for bringing all fishes from Japan, that might be necessary. Other than the food, I like when strict-looking chef shows humorous side to celebrate customer's Birthday."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",exquisite sushi,50,12 September 2015,"We had an exquisite lunch at the Shinji Raffles Hotel. The short menu is of 9 sushi courses, mostly tuna. The tuna simply melts like butter in the mouth and the service was wonderful. Pricey at $200 but you are paying for quality."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Exceptional sushi, this is an art! Mind-blowing!",50,7 September 2015,"Made a lunch reservation for 2 through email and the restaurant replied very quickly, hassle free! Upon arrival, we were greeted politely and made to sit at the beautiful sushi bar. The restaurant was very quiet and ambience was fantastic. Ordered the 15-piece lunch set and was not disappointed at all! EVERYTHING-from the appetisers, to the nigiri sushi, to the desserts at the end...everything was perfect, flawless. Highlights of the meal were definitely the Uni, Chutoro and Otoro! The grilled tiger prawn is worth a mention too! This meal is just too good! Friendly chefs and brilliant service. Definitely will be back in no time."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",good sushi but overpriced a bit,40,22 August 2015,"i would say it might be a good sushi restaurant overall. But i doubt it can be really claimed as best sushi outside Japan. I would expect better food given it's ranked top 50 asian restaurant among just a few Singapore restaurants. nice place with good privacy and intimate. The Japanese chef is professional and friendly. what's more, he can speak some English, same as Japanese waitress. Service is good. I ordered 9piece sushi lunch set given limited lunch time. It starts with a few very ordinary sushi in terms of quality of sashimi on the top. but toro and prawn sushi was excellent. i think the quality of sushi is good but just not the quality of the material (most are just ordinary material we can try at normal japanese restaurant). with tax and service charges, it costs ~SGD90 for the set, which is a bit overpriced. Their dinner is super expensive, al SGD250+"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but explicit ,50,4 August 2015,"The level of quality here is too dream for in Europe. Our chef was explicit and professional. Service and food was perfect. The only minus is the high price. The ""big"" omakase is expensive, but with a menu including 4 kinds of Uni, you will expect this. Sake was absolutely great. Best sushi experience outside and maybe inside of Jspan. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Definitely top 3 in Singapore ,50,1 August 2015,"Went with a group of 6. The bill came up to $2400 including a bottle of sake. The food is at its' freshest and finest. Is authentic jap food with no fusion. They do it the traditional way. Do request for room sitting, u have better privacy then the main hall. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",wonderful,50,24 July 2015,I tried this food outlet for a couple who love me. they asked me to bring a friend to this restaurant. they tried this food a lot of times alrdy. they love it so much that they call it their darling.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistently delicious.,40,20 July 2015,"I have visited shinji at Raffles hotel 3 times within the past 10 months, they never fail to deliver a high standard of finely crafted sushi.Ever since my first time at Shinji, it opened my mind on how good sushi can be. Ever since then, i've abandoned all the other seafood rice masquarading as 'sushi'. End of the day, you get what you pay for in Singapore. I'd gladly pay as i know i am in very good hands."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Totally worth the price!,40,13 July 2015,I tried and loved the sister restaurant in Macau and decided to give the one in Singapore a try. I wasn't disappointed! You can choose from three different sets and I went for the biggest one. Totally delicious but way more than I could eat. The four varieties of sea urchin was amazing! The sashimi and sushi were fresh and super delicious. Sake was very good too. Fantastic meal.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Overpiced for what it si,20,10 July 2015,"Don't think it's worth to spend this much money on sushi. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just way overpriced. There are plenty of other options for great sushi in Singapore to spend your money on/"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I had in Singapore,40,7 July 2015,"As a Sushi Lover, I tried to squeeze my time from all the meeting just to try this restaurant. Cost for dinner is quite high, 300 SGD ++ for Omakase course. But I have to say that I was satisfied. Wabasi here is extreme strong but yet give you a very good experience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Love the sushi,50,30 June 2015,"I love the sushi there. The service staff and sushi chef are friendly. They can speak good English so don't worry if you don't speak Japanese. They carry good range of sakes. You can ask for sushi bar counter when you make reservation. Most of the time it is full so please make reservation in advance especially weekend is very crowded. Recently they have just renovated the restaurant, but not much different (extra private dining area). The ingredients are fresh and mostly imported."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese food at its best,50,30 June 2015,"We went there for our wedding anniversary lunch. And boy, we were not disappointed. We had the Omakase and we were very impressed by everything that was served by the chef. Food was so simple and delicious and we enjoyed watching the chef in action. Definitely worth the price and it's a really nice place for special occasions. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very Good Quality Tokyo Style Sushi Rest In Spore,40,26 June 2015,Have not been to Shinji quite some time but it's still one of my favourite REAL sushi place for top quality Tokyo Ginza Style sushi.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$16.67++ per piece,40,26 June 2015,"That's the cost per piece of sushi. I must say regardless of the price that the sushi was really good. Fresh, artfully prepared and the service was great. It was an experience and not just putting food in your belly. The ambience, attention the chef gives and the great service the waitresses gives makes it an experience. For 15 pieces you pay $250 which works out to be $16,67 per piece. But really you pay $250 for a 2 hours experience which works out to be about $2 per minute :) They do have the $300 and $450 menu as well."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Mouth watering,50,18 June 2015,Had the Omakase set for $250. It was worth it. Had a few reviews saying that it is the best outside Japan and I have to agree that it is the best sushi I have ever tasted (excluding the ones in Japan since Ive never been there).Staffs are friendly and will ask if you have any allergies prior to serving you the food. The chef will explain what sushi he prepared for you. Reservation is recommended. Did my reservation using e-mail so the restaurant is quite efficient.Will definitely come back here again.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A finger of wasabi,50,16 June 2015,"Finally had the chance to head down to Shinji tonight with my boyfriend and his father. We were served by Chef Yoshi.He was excellent in communicating with us and also, more importantly, preparing the wonderful feast we had in store.The food was amazing, the service was superb. Couldn't have asked for anything more."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Slighty expensive omakase yet I enjoyed it,50,16 June 2015,"Opted for the Shinji at Raffles Hotel to see the much hyped cypress tree table. Bigger seating (16 if I counted correctly) than most of the sushi master restaurants in Ginza (Tokyo). Had the omakase shin menu. Indeed a tasting delight in my opinion cause every fish, fruit and vegetable is caught and cropped then flown in from Japan. One can taste the difference on the awabi, kinmedai and uni (Hokkaido and Kyushu) being served. The downside were the nigiri pieces were not up to mark cause they used less vinegar on the shari. Perhaps customers should be given a choice if they prefer a stronger taste. The akagai and simmered tuna pieces too fell short as both lacked a richer umami. Slightly more expensive compared to Tokyo for the price I paid excluding sake. Japanese beef or other grilled items except tuna steak was not part of the menu and didn't get the maki roll standard in most sushi courses. Worth it to sample one of the best restaurants in town once in a blue moon."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Is it worth it?,30,24 May 2015,"Shinji is not a 2 Michellin star restaurant: its chef has been awarded 2 stars but not for this restaurant. Shinji serves the best sashimi I have ever tasted. Bar none. But in the end, it is raw seafood. Ain't no big deal. Its wine list is limited but its Saki menu is extensive. If you walk out of there for less than $900 Singapore dollars you have done well. If you book a table at the Sushi bar don't expect a private dining experience. I'm pleased we went there but pleased my partner paid. It is so over-rated that I would not go back. But, been there, done that. Tick."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good sashimi,40,23 May 2015,"Went there on thursday night made rsvp 3 days before. Restaurant located on 2nd floor, at first it was a bit hard to find in such a big hotel. The restaurant is very small. All of the seats are in the sushi bar about 20 seats. The chefs were 4 with 3 waitress. We ordered omakase wa. Omakase means we trust the food to the chef. There were 3 choices. One is set menu around SGD 220++ omakase wa is SGD 300++ and the highest omakase is SGD 450++All the fish they serve all import from japan 4 times a week. So they guarantee the freshness and best quality. The chefs are young fun polite and very friendly. They even drink several glass of sake with other customer. They explain each dish they serve including how to make fresh wasabi.With the price and type of dishes we got, I would say it's overpriced. We paid SGD 1260 for 3 omakase and a bottle of sake. However if you are looking for good authentic fresh sashimi, go to Shinji. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top quality ingredients. Great service.,40,22 May 2015,"This is a really small space, basically just seats around a sushi counter but it is a 2 Michelin-star restaurant! The service was superb and ingredients used were of top quality. The chef asked if there were any ingredients that we don't eat, took note that I don't take squid and replaced it with fresh shrimps. Two of us, we ordered a nigiri sushi set and an omakase set, and the chef very thoughtfully split the two sets among us so that we both got to try everything. My favourites of the dinner were uni (sea urchin) and akami (tuna belly). Melted in the mouth! Each grain of rice was round and full. Dessert was musk melon and matcha ice cream, not too sweet, very subtle on the palate which was a great way to finish the dinner wholesomely."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for!!,50,17 May 2015,"Shinji by Kanesake, tucked away in a quite corner of Raffles Hotel and best loved hotel. Singapore has plenty of Japanese restaurants right from the chains such as Sushi Tei to the celebrity chefs. Shinji falls in the highest category when it comes to Omakase restaurants in Singapore, it is located in the colonial Raffles Hotel and is set up in traditional Japanese style with tables by the sushi counter and then some private rooms. An omakase menu is featured and skillfully executed by a native Japanese team of artisan chef's. They have 3 or 4 set menus that one can choose from, most have a similar base of dishes with some add-ons. The chef asked us whether we wanted a selection of sashimi and sushi or just sushi. We opted for a combination.We were treated to yellow fin tuna, needle fish, sea urchins in sashimi and then blue-fin tuna, spanish mackerel and horse mackerel, my personal favourite was Sword fish.For desserts we were served the musk melon with salted ice-cream. And that was a fantastic end to a great meal. All along, the service was great. Do note, as with most high end Japanese restaurants, this one too charges top dollar and is usually frequented for business dinners or special occasions."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Pricey but worth every cent,50,8 May 2015,"Went there with my wife in March 2015. Had to make reservations about 2 weeks before my date. Took up the seats on the counter where you can have first hand interaction with the Chef. We gave the Chef the luxury of delighting us with his choice of dishes for the evening, and he also recommended the sake. I must say the food was excellent. The sashimi was the freshest I have ever tasted. There was also a number of fusion Japanese dishes which he so proudly created. The Chef's creation is a must try. Very unique and mouth watering as I write this article. My wife and I will definitely go back there again. The only setback is that the dinner will put a hole in your pocket. My damage for the evening was SGD1,500 but like I said, Pricey but worth every cent!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Highest quality sushi, but lack of variety",40,6 May 2015,"Having heard about this restaurant's stellar reputation, I went to the branch at Raffles Hotel for lunch. You definitely need to book ahead to eat here, as the place is small and there are only 18 seats around the sushi counter (they do have private rooms but you won't see the actions from there). Several guests were clearly regulars, which is a good sign for restaurant of this level.The lunch set menus start at $75 up to $250, which can be considered ""cheap"" compared to dinner ($220 to $450). The $250 option comprises of about 9 nigiri sushi plus appetizer, sashimi, and cooked dishes. If you are a lover of Japanese cuisine, the usual suspects for high-end sushi are likely to be in the menu (the fatty tunas chu-toro and o-toro, sea urchin, bonito). But the most impressive items (that I had not seen before) came at the start - the baby squid and the translucent baby eel, both served as sashimi. As for the quality of the cut and freshness, you can hardly complain - this is probably as good as it gets, at least outside Japan. However, with this price tag I'd really like to see more variety in the set menu. Tuna came up several times, as did sea urchin. They could, for example, serve more shellfish, e.g. clams or oysters. And the dessert (green tea ice cream and melon) was too plain for me. I honestly didn't get all the fuss about Japanese melon - for me it only tasted slightly better than the normal one. So I was satisfied, but not extraordinarily so. Perhaps if you go for dinner and pay $450, you'd get more ""exotic"" stuff. But then it's getting to be too expensive. Or you can try bringing a gift (a bottle of sake) for the head chef and the staff, which is what the regulars do. This might persuade the chef to part with some of his more prized possessions..."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for !,50,1 May 2015,We had read about this restaurant and were not disappointed worth the price if you like exquisite sashimi served by a master. The timing was perfect and the chef delighted with continual questions made this meal special. Also fish we don’t get in Australia. The Yuzu sorbet desert still lingers.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Another faultless dinner,50,22 April 2015,"My second visit, and another memorable meal that did not disappoint. Expensive, but excellent value and well worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good experience but once is enough,30,16 April 2015,"At the cost of 300 over dollars per head, I thought I would be served lobster, tuna belly or some horse meat sashimi. But none of the above. Instead , I get run of the mill type of fish like red snapper, tuna , yellowtail and octopus. But to give credit to the chef, the fish served are really fresh and the sea urchin (uni) has got a tinge of sweetness rather than the salty taste usually associated with it. Service and ambience are acceptable. Overall, the quality of food served is good and I never thought i'd say this but the best part of the meal was the fruit dessert. The honey melon was outstanding. It had this soft, translucent texture and tasted of bubble gum and wine. Unfortunately, the portion was small and it left me wanting for more. I would recommend this restaurant only if you or your loved one are celebrating a special occasion and want to splurge. But for the price, for me, once is good enough."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore now I m convinced,50,7 April 2015,"Title says It all, and I am very very very demanding about Sushi ...probably one of the only two places in Singapore that comes close to the quality which you can get in the top places in Tokyo"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worst service,10,4 April 2015,Eaten here few times but this time around the chef probably thought too much of their popularity. We paid sgd500 per head and at the end when my wife wanted to order an additional handroll because she was hungry the chef pointed at his wrist and said times up. Basically we had to leave. Food was also served in a hurried manner. Is this the service we expect from a supposedly fine dining restaurant?? Maybe in Singapore but definitely not in Japan.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Highest grade,50,3 April 2015,The food here is exquisite. The chefs exude disciplined knowledge of their trade. The sushi is literally tailored to your tastes. Setting is dull but the event is the food and service. Madness to miss.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisitely good,50,25 March 2015,"My husband and I celebrated our birthdays together, we were brought there by our son and daughter-in-law. Sitting at the counter we were served the freshest and exquisitely prepared pieces of fish and seafood. The chef singlely, devotedly delivered his creations to his guests and clearly explained from which part of Japan they came from. We are quite amazed that they come from almost every far corners of the country. Tell him your likes and he will offer that extra portion of otoro. It was not inexpensive, the lunch omakase was $250 per person. The meal ended magically when all lights went off and 3 clown-faces popped out to sing happy birthday! What a lovely surprise."

Wife and I have been sevedral time never really spnding less than SGD1,000 for the meal admittedl with nice bottle of sake at dinner.Every thing Japanese, chefs and most of staff when we there (dont' know how foreign employee controls impact them). Not much to gripe if on can afford to eat at this restaurant apart from a strange sterile experience after the first time. Don't get me wrong - consistent excellent execution is a sign of top knotch quality - perhaps a little too formulaic.So perhaps, in conclusion, a must try but don't go too often even if you can afford it :)"

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese food I experienced in a long time.,50,17 March 2015,"Fantastic Japanese food. Freshest and one of the best quality I experienced ever.
High prices but worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",INCREDIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE,50,15 March 2015,"We chose Shinji by Kanesaka for our last dinner in Singapore and it was so beyond our expectations that we will long remember it as the standard for fine sashimi. You should know what you are getting yourself into before you go otherwise you might be a little overwhelmed. We ordered the Omakase at Singapore $330 each. For two hours we were entertained by these masters and fully satiated with the most exquisite sashimi we have ever tasted. We ordered a premium carafe (or three!) of sake, which tasted like silk. From the glass fish to the baby tuna, the Horse Head fish soup to the octopus it just kept coming. It is going to be impossible to top this!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic! Well Executed Japanese Restaurant,50,1 March 2015,"Had the lunch sushi set 12 pieces (including Sea Urchin, Otoro, anago) over the weekend. We sat infront of the Master Sushi Chef Oshino. Felt like we had front row seats to a culinary art show. Great performance! He had a junior chef beside him doing the more basic tasks. It was nice to see the master teaching him and sharing with us some sushi preparation tips. The meal was expensive, but the quality of fish was very good (they import fish direct from Tokyo 4x/week). The best sushi for me was a tie between the sea urchin and the horse mackerel. Will be back."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Underwhelming.....,20,15 February 2015,"I previousy had lunch at Shinji (Raffles Hotel) and it was a good experience. Hence my wife and I were looking forward to our dinner in Shinji. The welcome and initial impression was good and was as expected. After ordering our drinks, we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait.Eventually I figured out that there was an event going on in the private room next door. The chef serving us our omakase dinner was apparently tasked to prepare the food for them. So when we sat down at 7.45pm, and finished 2 beers and 1 bottle of sake, after 30 minutes - the appetizer arrived.My first piece of sushi arrived at 9.30pm and by then, the guests next to us and us as well, were getting a little hungry - just a wee bit. All through this time, our sushi chef could not talk to us as he was just too busy. In fact he did not even top up the preserved ginger. Which was terrible because that was all I was able to eat for the previous 45 minutes.And the dinner really started at 10pm (when the private room has finished eating), and that's when he served the 2nd piece of sushi - lucky us!!The dinner finished by 10.30pm. While the sushi and quality of food was top notch, I think that the pace of dinner is NOT acceptable. Jiro in Tokyo would have finished the entire meal in 45 minutes. All in all, it was quite an unpleasant experience.I should think if there is an event that the restaurant cannot cope, don't take further reservation. I guess in future, if you want attentiveness as part of your meal here, be sure to be very rich and book the private room. If not, be prepared to feel distinctly second class. Either that or perhaps order the most expensive omakase (mine was the ""middling level"" omaskase), perhaps then you may be deemed worthy of their attention. Good sushi though...no, actually excellent sushi. What a pity."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not worth it. Completely overrated and expensive,20,31 January 2015,"We arrived for dinner at this lovely restaurant. The lovely lady welcomed us warmly and with a smile which is rare in Singapore. The restaurant offers 3 package meals, the cheapest is the 15 sushi piece meal with soup and is $220 per pax.We ordered the sushi meal and immediately the lady's face changed and in front of us crossed eyes with the chef and rolled their eyes. The chef asked us if we were sure that we didn't want sashimi. We confirmed that we wanted only sushi and answered with a disproving tone as if he was too tired to make all that sushi or wasn't worth his while.The course menu was ok but nothing spectacular, the rice was hard and uncooked, the nigiri felt apart. This is not a bad restaurant but it's not worth what they charge and does not deserve the reputation.As a plus, the chef accepted several sake shots from another customer and by the end of our course he was happily drunk and very distracted. He also accepted tips very happily. Not something you would expect from a Japanese chef of this category."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Best Sushi You'll Ever Eat,50,19 January 2015,"I had a superlative experience at Shinji for lunch. So many reviews said they were top notch so I was skeptical when I arrived. It was a Monday & I didn't have a reservation. No matter as the seats around the sushi counter were not all filled. Opting for the most luxurious or Omakase lunch (at S$250 a small fortune). But what was served was freshness itself & well worth the price though dining here would have to remain a treat, not an everyday meal. The omakase comprised a selection of sashimi, sushi, soup & dessert. I'd have to say my favourites were the platter of mixed sashimi ranging from mackerel to scallop. There was also a very clean tasting seaweed soup with scallops to begin with & was very pure but satisfying. Of all the sushi, I'd have to say my favourites were chutoro (tuna belly) and aji (horse mackerel). This is not a conveyor belt sushi restaurant so please resist the urge to dunk every piece of sushi in shoyu. The rice is slightly warm (in my opinion heightens the flavour & freshness of the fish) and you can taste the fish which is flown in from Japan all the better if unmasked by the soy. The meal was rounded off by a clam broth & the most perfect Japanese fresh fruit - musk melon & persimmon. You could not ask for more. I'd certainly return but perhaps opt for the less extravagant offerings as every meal here is an experience. You owe it to yourself to go. Chef Yoshi who serve me was attentive & professional as were the rest of the servers."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best,50,10 January 2015,When you come to Shinzo you can expect great service and quality of food. I guess it's worth paying for such assurance. Chef never let you down. Our 3rd visit and we always leave happy. Thank you guys.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,50,30 December 2014,"A unique experience, very fresh & well prepared sushi, excellent service. Booking a table is advisable. For a better price, go for lunch."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Clearly this is how Japanese food is supposed to taste,50,26 December 2014,Accustomed to sushi off a conveyor belt this experience was an eye-opening feast. One which makes me wonder about the difference in quality of produce used at chain restaurants and premium locations like Shinji. It was a treat for me and one that will certainly stay on my all time favourites list. I learned for example that sushi served with warm rice tastes a whole lot better and I learned just how good tuna can taste.So the thing that I remember best about this meal is the fact that the freshness of the produce used is outstanding. One very simple course was the tuna and white leek maki. Lunchtime omakase costs less than dinner and makes it a little more approachable. Not the cheapest experience but certainly worth it.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",BEST SUSHI IN SINGAPORE!,50,23 December 2014,This was one of the best sushi experiences and the best in Singapore. The lunch sushi sets are value for money.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent omakase!,50,20 December 2014,"Our dinner was a great experience, sitting at the sushi bar (of the St. Regis) and being served directly and non-stop by the head chef who was friendly and fun. We went for the omakase and did not regret it as all items served were top-quality, and very tasteful. Serving staff was excellent, quick, but not intrusive, while the overall ambiance was very nice. Was it one of the greatest sushi meals one could have? Potentially yes. Was it worth the SGD 400 per person (incl. drinks)? Probably not. Point of improvement: they could introduce a long list of Japanese whiskies."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite Omakase,50,19 December 2014,"As I’ve heard and read so much about Shinji before coming to Singapore and it’s been on my must-try places to eat for some time, I seized the opportunity to dine here on a recent business trip, and I must say, the experience was absolutely sublime and exquisite. It is simply the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. When I walked through the sliding door and the three Japanese sushi chefs behind the counter greeted us heartily, I had to double check that I had not been tele-ported to Japan. We sat at the sushi bar – an arrangement where chef and customer are in close interaction. Our chef Yoshizawa’s skills with his knives and attention to detail in his preparation of all the dishes really made for a personable and enjoyable dining experience. After having experienced Shinji for myself, I read with amusement some of the reviews written by other contributors, some claiming to be well travelled and knowledgeable. Example, “menu is less varied (no beef and few cooked dishes)”? – oh please don’t reveal your ignorance by asking for beef in an exclusive sushi restaurant. The best Japanese fine dining is found in specialty restaurants, where the spotlight is on just one dish, where chefs compete among themselves in the quality and taste of a particular dish, and where customers can experience the brightest examples of Japanese cuisine.That’s what I love about Shinji. It serves the best Edomae nigiri sushi which means sushi prepared with freshly caught fish in the traditional and purist style of the golden Edo period of Japan; hence don’t expect to find salmon or crab sticks.And, “sushi pieces being less innovative”? I’ve been brought to some other Japanese restaurants (shan’t name them here) where the chefs blow torch their fish or garnish them in the name of innovation, but it is just a vain attempt to mask the lack of freshness of the fish that can no longer be served raw. It’s like, I was told, in Chinese cuisine, if the fish is not fresh, one shouldn't cook it by steaming, but frying with chilli may conceal the bad taste.Is this place ridiculously expensive? I certainly feel that I had good value for my money and there are other Japanese restaurants in Singapore that you end up paying the same and even more for lower quality food and poorer dining experience. The good thing is, at Shinji, you know how much you are paying for your food. There are no off-menu special dishes. Many a times I’ve felt ripped off in other restaurants by staff who (in front of my guests) recommended expensive seasonal items and then charged an arm and a leg. At least at Shinji, the omakase menu is all inclusive. Certainly I give this restaurant two thumbs up!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi Experience,50,19 December 2014,"Booked by email for noon, when I got there they could not find the booking. I was alone so they managed to find a seat at the Sushi Counter. You must book, as seats are limited, and I think it just turns around once for lunch.Read about this place in Trip Advisor. Staff was Japanese. Always within a few feet and making sure if glass was empty, or anything they would be there to help.Went for the middle sushi menu and deeply regret not having gone for the larger one, not because I was hungry but because of the experience.Don't go in a Hurry, I thought 12 pieces of Sushi should no take long (I got there at 12 and had a flight at 3). By 1315 I had to ask the chef how many sushis left, and there were still 5 to go. It right have been rude but I had to request him to slowly speed up the last as I had to rush.For each Sushi they open bring a Box from the Fridge underneath, open a Wooden Box, Extract a piece of fish, cut it and make the Sushi. If other diners next to you are at the same pace then they will make for them as well, if not all this procedure to make one Sushi.Rice is warm, perfect temperature to get an amazing taste. Fish amount is perfect. Wasabi is there and not overdone. Spectacular.As you eat he will see your pace and only start the next one when you have finished. Cleans your plate, and soon after places the next Sushi.The taste of Each Sushi was to die for.Regret: That I was not in a hurry and could not enjoy as much as I should have.Left the restaurant wishing to come back asap.It is expensive, each Sushi comes to around 8US$ (not for 2 but for ONE). I hate to say given the quality, to pay US$8 in many high end places for 2 sushis, I find this place comparatively cheap.Nothing to complain. Amazing Sushi experience.(Have read the review from the person who got sick from here. Accidents can happen anywhere, though I would love to know where he had had lunch that day. Food Intoxication can happen anywhere). Do not stop going here because of this review. Don't go if it is beyond your budget, and if you dont like Sushi.By the way No Soya Sauce. my belief is that if the quality of the produce is good, you never need and additives.Writing this and wishing I could eat there again.Thank you for the experience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Food poisoning,10,17 December 2014,"Severe food poisoning after the Omakase Shin meal. We had dinner and around midnight, I felt that my stomach was very uncomfortable but didnt think much about it. Around 2am, I stared vomiting and this repeatedly went on throughout the night (vomited at least 5 times throughout the night and at least 7 in total including the next day)Reached out to Shinji to check into the cleanliness and was told that they uphold food hygiene to the highest standards and that stomachs react differently to a particular ingredient although they would still check on the menu. In the end, they came back and said that the chef looked into the menu and no other customers had any stomach upset. This was not our first time going to a fine dining Japanese restaurant and this has never happened. I have not even had food poisoning ever since I could rememberNot worth paying SGD600 per pax for food poisoning."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elegance and attention to detail,50,15 December 2014,"My wife and I treated ourselves for lunch at the sushi counter at Shinji. The menu is based on either 9 piece, 12 pirec of 15 piece meal for sushi. omakase is over the top expensive for lunch at SGD$250++. the 9 piece foes fo $75++ and and 12 piece for $125++. The maths did not work out but the quality in the 3 extra I had made the difference in price! Very Japanese - waitresses all were Japanese, clad in Kimonos and the service was discreetly attentive. The sushi came with huge chunks of fish - as fresh as can be. The attending sushi chef explains each morsel as he makes it one at the time. He even paces the courses so that we are in ""sync"" A great meal - ate with my hands as recommended and the odour of fresh sardine lingered on for the afternoon on the fingers! Worth an experience just to splurge."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,50,9 December 2014,"An absolutely fantastic dining experience.Seats about fourteen (so make sure you book), all around it's main sushi counter where you have your own chef preparing your lunch/dinner in front of you. The decor is classic and simple and feels like Japan.We were here for lunch and opted for ""Tsuki"" (12 pieces of sushi) and were blown away. I have no idea what each individual piece was (couldn't quite understand our chef), but I can confirm the ingredients were incredibly fresh and of the highest quality. The rice was warm and filling, with each piece of fish having a perfectly judged amount of wasabi. It was a delight to watch a chef, clearly at the heights of his profession, go about his craft. There is not much in the way of non-fish so be warned if that's not your thing.Service was wonderful. Attentive, unobtrusive, and charming.A lovely restaurant and one we would love to visit again. Very good experience."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top Sushi,50,5 December 2014,"Stumbled on to this place first night in Singapore. Was not disappointed. First class sushi in a simple but nice dining room with attentive staff and great chef. One of the best sushi meals I have had.Fair to say it is not at all cheap but the quality of the ingredients, the care in preparation and the overall experience means it is worth every penny.Also fair to say that the omakase (chef's choice) dining style means that you might get some unusual ingredients. A few reviewers seem to have been put off by this. However, if you are brave, all of the food is an experience. If not, we saw quite a few diners ask the chef to steer clear of unusual items and they were graciously accommodated.Well deserved it's good reputation on TA. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Absolute amazing melt in ur mouth dinner,50,4 December 2014,I cant recall having fish like this outside of Japan so well done to Shinji !!! Great sake too and hot tea on tab. I cant praise the food enough - words will do it no justice so just treat yourself and GO !!!!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but less than I expected,30,3 December 2014,"Don't get me wrong, this is exceedingly good sushi in a nice environment and sitting at the sushi bar watching the very talented chef do his thing was a great experience. On these points I would probably give a 4-star rating however given how ridiculously expensive the restaurant is, it needs to be offering more than just good sushi and it fails to reach the heights of other places I've eaten that were priced (a little) more reasonably. The final piece of fish was basically a grilled/roasted shrimp head which was frankly unpleasant and only one of our party was able to eat all of it. So overall good, but there is far better value out there and I'll try somewhere else next time. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite Sushi,50,1 December 2014,"We had an exquisite lunch at the Shinji Raffles Hotel. The short menu is of 9 sushi courses, mostly tuna, of a quality I have never had in Sydney. The tuna simply melts like butter in the mouth. The service was wonderful."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best inTown,50,30 November 2014,yes it is not cheap but it's a gastronomic experience and worth every dollar spent. The whole experience is great with all the chefs super talented and trained to deserve being on the line. Fish is air flown fresh and each one has a special sauce and sequence to be eaten. Lunch prices are cheaper tha dinners and your guests will sure have a memorable experience. To me its the best in town and have been there many times and never dissapointed !
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Out of this world,50,29 November 2014,"I decided to try this place having read so many pleasant reviews on blogs/Tripadvisor. My expectations were set high before visiting and I must say I left the restaurant extremely satisfied. I have never tasted such delicious sushi in my entire life. These guys really make sushi an art.I tried the lunch Omakase ($250++) so total bill came up to just under $300. I marvelled at the ingredients used - all top notch. Sitting at the sushi counter watching the chef whip up our sushi was a real delight.While eating the sushi, I ran out of superlatives to describe how good each piece was.My suggestion - if you can afford it, don't even think about it. Just go."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ichiban,50,26 November 2014,"Top notch Japanese at Raffles hotel. Very simple menu but prepared and presented with the highest care and quality. Excellent service by Japanese staff. Top quality fish imported from Japan I believe. It will dent your credit card but for that special occasion, it is an excellent choice. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","How do you say ""the best"" in Japanese?",50,25 November 2014,"This is definitely the best place for sushi in Singapore; but it comes at a price too LOL.
Food is fresh and just so good. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent ..maybe the best Sushi place in Singapore ? Comes at a price ..,40,23 November 2014,"This is a very classic Japanese Sushi restaurant located in the beautiful Raffles Hotel complex , so to really Max out your credit card on style , indulge yourself after dinner with cool drinks ( Singapore Slings ) at the Rafles Hotel Bar as well !I am fanatic about my Sushi Rice and Shinji probably has the closest to the top quality rice you can get from the superstar Tokyo sushi chefs..The quality of the meal was outstanding.Just read that a 3 stars Sushi Chef in London is now charging 300 GBP per Omasake , so I suppose the prices her are after all good value !"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh!,40,20 November 2014,Fresh with plenty of seasonal fish to choose from which is great! The service is good and the place has a nice atmosphere!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese food at its best,50,16 November 2014,"This restaurant is in the Raffles building but is not officially part of the hotel. I went to have a look in the afternoon with a view to eating there that evening by myself. They wanted to know where I was staying and how to contact me before they would make the booking. I can understand that they might be worried about people not turning up as it is an expensive restaurant. Be prepared to pay a high price, but if you love Japanese food as I do, this restaurant is paradise. The food is prepared in front of you and every mouthful is a sensual experience and a work of art. With Japanese food, you think you will never be full, but after many little dishes, you begin to feel that you have had your fill. I ate mostly fish dishes, from little orange jewels of salmon roe to octopus. I don't drink alcohol and my bill came to 353 Singapore dollars, but I had no regrets as it was as good an experience as any of the attractions in Singapore and one that will live with me for some time. The kimono clad ladies ready to assist at every moment were delightful and the chefs are artists of great skill. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lunch at Shinji,50,15 November 2014,"Ordered the Tsuki menu 12 pieces, great sushi! Oh! The 6 months old baby tuna sushi is to die for! Great food, great atmosphere, great chefs, great service! I will come back again and again!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese food outside of Japann ,50,12 November 2014,I dined at their restaurant at St Regis rather than Raffles . The food was better than anything I have had outside Japan or at Kuruma Sushi in NYC . Had middle priced omakase menu - very expensive but worth it . Saves you airfare to Tokyo . Outstanding food . 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The top 3 best omakase in South east Asia..,50,8 November 2014,"One of the top 3 best omakase in the region. The toro are really good, but the best of the best is the uni donburi with toro. This is .unique dish because Kanesaka san mix the uni with rice and.blend.together with toro, which sound new to me. Very very good dish and very tasty uni. The tuna cheeck grilled also good. One thing that they lack is no beef. Sake choice is small but very good. Overall, its a.must try."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top Japanese Food in the Raffles Hotel,50,1 November 2014,"We enjoyed excellent and refined Japanese cuisine before we flew back to Europe. The menu options are all expensive but well worth the price. The Chef is a master in Japanese cuisine and prepares the food in front of you, asking you about any preferences you may have. The ingredients are fresh and of absolutely top quality. The whole experience is a delight."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best omakase in Singapore,50,23 October 2014,"We have been back in this wonderful restaurant a couple of times as we have always enjoyed their offerings every single visit. It is not cheap, although lunch is much cheaper than dinner, but you do get your money's worth with the quality on offer. The chefs were friendly and have always done their best to entertain the customers, and the sashimi is one of the best that we have had anywhere."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A must do venue for Japanese cuisine!,40,23 October 2014,"Be prepared for exorbitant prices for some of the best sushi in Singapore, but definitely worth the high price for this unique sushi experience.

A must do venue if you're keen on Japanese food and visiting Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent excellent,50,15 October 2014,"How do you fault perfect sushi? If you can pay the price, Shinji is worth it. Lunch is slightly more affordable than dinner but you do get your money's worth at dinner.Service was impeccable too. And yes, the birthday surprise was cool and I like that the sushi chefs have a good sense of humor. He joked that the team comes in early in the morning to practice.Yum. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great food. Great atmosphere. Great entertainment,50,27 September 2014,"Had a wonderful relaxing Thursday evening lapping up simple yet delicious sushi. The best I've had in Singapore. Ishizawa-San brought out the best in every piece and every bite. He is serious about his craft and relaxed with his guests. Service and attention to detail is excellent as always. There was a celebration that day and the 3 chefs donned on bunny ears and massive clown sunglasses for a surprised rendition of happy birthday. All in all, an amazing night out."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",At par with some of Japan's best,40,16 September 2014,"Sashimi was one of the freshest I've had in the world. The sushi master chef was a wonder to watch as he yielded his knifing skills, prepared the sushi rice and added just the right amount of wasabi. A tad expensive but you definitely get what you pay for."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Divine. Simply divine.,50,12 September 2014,THis was my first experience at a Japanese restaurant of this quality. Course after course of outstanding Sushi; Downing sake shots with the chef; incredible knife artistry by the chef; fish that melts in your mouth. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. It was unforgettable.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of best Japanese restaurant,50,8 September 2014,Went to shinji last week and the food was just out of this world. The sashimi and uni were really fresh and service was impeccable. Price is of course higher than most Japanese restaurants but at least we are paying for really high quality stuff.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Like eating in Tokyo,50,30 August 2014,"Wonderful place that you wont be disappointed if you love eating sushi and sashimi. Please note that the food is more traditional sushi so it is not the same as what you eat in a normal Japanese restaurant. It is not cheap, but if you appreciate quality food then this is one place you should go. They have 2 branches and both are the same."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sublime Sushi Experience,50,15 August 2014,"Be prepared for exorbitant prices for some of the best sushi in Singapore, but definitely worth the high price for this unique sushi experience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi and sashimi!,50,31 July 2014,"We were seated at the sushi bar, only 8 seats in total with two chefs. Everything is made fresh in front of you, really enjoyed the experience. Kind of ""you make it and we eat it!""The Urchin is real fresh, very tasty indeed, the chef made something with the Urchin, I will call it Urchin ""fried rice"", but not really fried...it's sushi rice mixed with fresh Urchin topped up with Ikura, what can I say other than wow, great taste so fresh and so yummy! High in cholesterol but hey, we only live once =)!If you are in Singapore I can recommend this place, sushi and sashimi doesn't get better than this, unless you are in Tokyo!Just one thing, not the most romantic setting, unless your date loves Japanese food then this is the place to go.Enjoy your meal."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$250 w/o tax for an AWFUL lunch Omakase! ,10,27 July 2014,"Was too excited when I got Shinji's reservation, been hearing really good reviews about this restaurant. I learned it the hard way. Shinji is a rip off. For $250, without tax (almost $300 with service charge and tax) we got the lowest quality of fish, maybe it was not my lucky day?? Or they thought ""Indonesians will pay anyways, they don't understand"" oh heck yes, I DO! We didn't even get chutoro or ootoro, and only 2 bites of Uni (a sushi and a dish). So what's so good about this restaurant? Maybe the one in St. regis is better? Never coming back. Awful awful awful omakase experience! Save your money and go to tatsuya, you won't regret it! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A real dining experience,50,24 July 2014,Having eaten in many Japanese restaurants in several countries (all outside of Japan) I have to say this is the best. Not only is the quality of the sashimi and sushi next level but it's a real dining expereince. Professional sushi chefs expertly prepare each course in front of you and serve it immediately. Every detail is perfect from the immaculately kept and incredibly sharp specialist knives to the centuries old (very expensive) wooden counter and chefs preparatin boards. Even the pickled ginger and wasabi tastes better.The restauarnt is very small so a reservation is essential - we went mid-week at lunch and it was full. Consequently the sevice feels personalised and is very attentive.As for the price: it's expensive even by Singapore standards but so worth every dollar. I cannot believe anyone would fail to be impressed by everything about Shinji. A must do venue if you're keen on Japanese food and visiting Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've Had!,50,14 July 2014,"Loved Shinji. Came here with the BF during our stay in Singapore and was pleasantly surprised that the price for our experience paid off. We both had the $350 omakase that had variations of dishes and sushi. I eat sushi about 2-3 times a week and am kind of a snob. Most new places I try rarely live up to its hype or feeds me things that I've already experienced. Shinji on the other hand, served a couple of fish i've never tasted before and varying dish preparations that I have not experienced. It was full of firsts and melt in your mouth fish. Will definitely come back when in Singapore. Yoshi, our sushi chef was fabulous! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best birthday present!! ,50,6 July 2014,"Surprised that I experience the best Japanese food in Singapore!! I went to so many Japanese cuisines across the countries, even in Japan. Absolutely this is one of the best and high-end place. It will def satisfy foody's sight and taste. Thanks for the happy birthday song ^_^ as well as juicy fruits!! Xx"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",My favorite restuarant,50,6 July 2014,"I firmly believe that this is quite possibly the best Japanese restuarant outside of japan. I always come back for more. I ordered the omakase set, the lighter one for my birthday. It started with some appetizers like uni and squid and then it got better. The sushi is very fresh but perfectly marinated and done with the touch of an expert chef. I loved the care in which the chef prepares each piece. Then there were some sashimi and cooked dishes. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. Highly recommended. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Heaven for food lovers,50,17 June 2014,This probably is the best meal I have had. I have never been to Japan so if Sushi is better there then I hope I go soon. My client took me here and I have to say when I looked at the prices I blushed so try and find someone to take you there. The food is fresh and sculptured into bites of heaven. The Maki sushi was my personal favorite.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Will return,50,17 June 2014,Had the hana 9 piece lunch set for $75. Every single sushi was an artwork and so skillfully prepared. It was a joy to watch the chef prepare it infront of you. Every piece was a delight. expect a lovely surprise if you go on your birthday!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A TASTE OF JAPAN IN SINGAPORE,50,12 June 2014,"It is relatively expensive but try it once and you will be longing for more! Definitely worth a visit! I had the Omakase Wa for dinner. Ingredients were really fresh and service was immaculate! Chef was also really humorous and kept us entertained throughout.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Food,50,27 May 2014,"Shinji is a small restaurant where the focus is superb food and excellent service. It is one of the finest sushi restaurants I have visited and whilst the cost is considerable, so is the quality of the food and attention to detail. If you like sushi then it is a must visit ...."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible meal outside of Japan,50,18 May 2014,Shinji is an impeccable dining experience. The fish is prepared in a traditional fashion and served with a delicate precision. Lovely wooden decor for the interior provided a comfortable setting for the meal. We would definitely recommend the omakase and you will not be disappointed. The highlight was when the chef revealed a box of uni and we watched as he prepared it for us as sushi. This is a restaurant in Singapore that is a must visit.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible Japanese banquet,50,15 May 2014,"Shinji is a cosy and intimate Japanese on the second floor of Raffles Hotel, with a traditional warm, soft wood interior. It has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite, helpful and impeccably efficient.We ate a ten course menu of gourmet seafood delights. The presentation was flawless and the variety exquisite. There were whole, deep fried hardshell baby crabs about the size of British fifty pence pieces - very crunchy - delicate sea urchin eggs, sushi and sashimi, accompanied by delicious sake. It was a lovely meal and the dessert selection of sticky, sweet moji, sesami and green tea ice cream, and a slice of melon provided a perfect close. By all accounts Shinji is the finest Japanese dining in Singapore. I wasn't paying, fortunately, as I understand that the prices are not for the faint hearted or weak of pocket. My friend blanched when the bill was presented, so I could tell it was not insubstantial. But as several reviewers have commented, sumptuous food and experienced Japanese chefs come at a premium. As long as you visit prepared for a fine meal and a large bill, you will not be disappointed.The owner, Mr Ong, and his wife were there, and made us feel very welcome. The restaurant is a credit to them."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic sushi,50,14 May 2014,"We got a recommendation to have some sushi while in Singapore, we found this small place simple sushi bar in Hotel Raffle in Beach road. You enter to a small sushi counter, maybe 20 seats. Youa re severed by the chef directly. One of the best restaurants ever, simple, fantastically fresh, quality outstanding. Very simple to order, they just asked if we didn't eat something, then just served what they had and was good for the day, didn't need a menu.I will go back any day. Price is quite expensive, but for the quality fair. Reservation recommended"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi and sashimi,50,4 May 2014,"Having dined all ovber the world and having grown a passion for Japanese food, I was totally gob-smacked by the expereince at Shinji. I tased varieties of seafood that I have never seen before (e.g. fresh spider crab) of a quality and freshness that bowled me over (e.g. sea urchin and tuna straight off one of their 4 weekly airfreight shipments from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo). The preparation was faultless and the service was excellent. Expect very little change from $1000 for two people even if you choose moderatley priced beer and sake rather than premium vintage champagne (and a bit more if you choose the top omakase menu called ""Shin"")but those who quibble about the price simply don't get it - it costs money to employ sushi chefs who have over 15 years of experience and it costs money to air-freight the best seafood you can find from Tokyo. If you are into Japanese this is a must-do expereince in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,50,18 April 2014,"We had the 'middle' sized menu, lots of different mouthfuls of all sorts of things! The guy doing the slicing spoke pretty good English and explained it all as we went along. Puddings delicious as well. There was a lot to eat so make sure you are hungry when you go!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Awesome food- Fresh from Japan,50,6 April 2014,"A friend bought me to Shinji for dinner. what i liked about the restaurant is that we were seated around the counter right in front of Chef Oshino! He whipped up his culinary skills, slicing all the fresh produce pretty skillfully. very patiently explaining to us what the dishes were when served to us. Loved the servings as there were bite size and oh, the food were so fresh! We had a good 22 kinds of food, including the dessert, which was the sweet melon & mango, with sake. awesome dishes!Understand from my friend that she has to book in advance for the slot.. Just loved this little restaurant tucked at the 2nd floor of Raffles hotel."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh,40,26 March 2014,Love the freshness and variety in the menu. Chose the S$300 course. Lovely food display. Reservation required as it is a small restaurant.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","So fresh, a real delight.",50,22 March 2014,"On a recent trip to Singapore, I booked for lunch to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday, as he loves Japanese. I was hoping that the restaurant would live up to the hype that I had read on this and other websites. I had emailed for the booking about 2 weeks out and had to confirm the morning of our booking, otherwise I would have forfeited my spot. The restaurant is set up in separate rooms with a chef central and table/bar set up around him so everyone gets an unimpeded view of the chef preparing the many dishes. our room had seating for 8 guests, but not sure if they are all the same.The food was magnificent and was very pleased to say the restaurant lived up to the hype. Attention to detail was extreme but graceful. It was like watching a performance, the prep, the reverence with the food, the effortless cleaning, the concentration on presentation, and the graciousness when being served. We had Keiichi san as our chef and he explained about the wasabi and how they grind it down using a shark skin mat, that is alarmingly sharp. Because we were a little later (our booking was for 2pm) we were the last in our room and had lots of opportunity to ask about the dishes, feel the balance of the knife and talk to the chef about his training and where he worked previously. I felt that our chef was very interested in explaining the dishes and general conversation, I didn't feel that we were putting him out or anything. The waitress was attentive but not annoying. She appeared at regular intervals when required, and otherwise gave us space. I really enjoyed this experience for the ambiance of the restaurant and the delightful food. If we make it back to Singapore would visit again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent,50,21 March 2014,"In Singapore, this is the best I've tried so far. The sushi is really fresh and you can taste the difference in quality here. I enjoyed every single dish. But that's not all, there are little things I observed here that I think really makes this place stand out. For example, I am left-handed but I did not tell anyone at the restaurant that I was. Nevertheless, the chef must have noticed when I picked up my cup or adjusted my chopsticks, because all the sushi he served me was at the exact opposite angle of those served to other patrons, simply because this makes it easier for a left-handed to pick it up. The waiters also caught on to this later and any item they placed on the table was adjusted from right to left."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Absolutely delicious,50,17 March 2014,"If quality top grade food is your priority, SHINJI is a MUST GO. I have called in on a Monday to book for lunch for Tues, however i was told that the restaurant was fully booked for lunch. Only to be surprised on Tuesday morning that seats were made available!Every single dish had the ""wow effect""! Ingredients were fresh and even the way the food were presented. The servers were exceptionally observant and attentive to our needs. Though its the second time I've been there, it continues to wow me and stays at the top of my MUST GO restaurants."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding experience,50,1 March 2014,"Being served by Keiichi-san has been a true honour for my husband and I. we were looking for the best sushi dinner in Singapore and we found it here. No need to say further: service, ingredients, settings and food were excellent.Definitely we will come again and again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi We Have Ever had,50,27 February 2014,"This is an amazing restaurant and worth every cent. It is difficult to get in, but it is worth the wait and the money. GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi,50,12 February 2014,"Shinji is easily the best sushi restaurant in Singapore. I travel to Singapore on a monthly basis and I have become a regular customer there, you cannot get fresher sushi that the ones in Shinji. It is not cheap, but definitely worth every dollar of it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best food & best service from Kikuchi San!,50,11 February 2014,"This was our third visit to Shinji (but first time to EOI branch).Kikuchi San was the sushi master who served us all this while.He was such talented chef. He prepared the food according to our needs, especially for my children. He knew that my children like kani maki (crab hand rolls), he especially prepared the real crab meat to make the kani maki for my kids. Usually the kani maki found in the market was the crab stick (make from fake crab or fish).Service was the best ever get from a fine Japanese restaurant.The food was imported from Japan everyday. They were fresh and juicy!The restaurant was sharing a same level restaurant space with another Chinese restaurant.Shinji EOI had only sushi counter which could only serve 8 to 10 guests per meal session.And it was the branch last day of operation. We were told they will be shifting to St. Regis soon.Can't wait to visit you again Kikuchi San!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistently Mind-Blowing,50,5 February 2014,"Traveled to Singapore again, and naturally, I had to drop by one of my favorite restaurants here!I had dinner there on the 27th of January 2014 (for my wedding anniversary) and again, earlier this evening, to celebrate my best friend's belated birthday.1. Quality of the foodSublime - the ingredients used are so fresh!!!Any fresher, and my slices of chutoro would have marched right off the plate. I half expected the pieces of uni on my little dish to break out into song. Dishes are evidently meticulously conceived and well thought out - I love how they combine flavours. Pretty much the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore, imho, and it's really difficult eating anywhere else because the sashimi/sushi at all other restaurants just pale in comparison.2. Quality of the serviceImpeccable, as always.When you make a reservation, Shinji always makes it a point to contact you a few days before to confirm the reservation, and again on the day itself. They are quick to follow-up with you, and consistently extremely reliable. Lois, especially (the manager) is extremely professional, warm and very, very sweet. Erica, also, always makes me feel very much at home. The chefs really know their stuff - and are very passionate and dedicated. When one is at Shinji, one is truly in good hands: You will be able to experience true Japanese hospitality -- excellent service, Oshino-san/Yoshi-san's gentle, self-deprecating humor mixed with warmth & professionalism."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great service and fresh food,50,30 January 2014,"Booked a lunch with my family here. Great email communications. Welcomed by 5 staff when arriving. Great to see Shinji preparing and overseeing the chef to deliver the nice lunch. Chosen the basic set menu thinking that we will need to have afternoon tea after this at Raffles as the menu only listed as 9 pieces of shushi. I was wrong, they keep on coming with extra appetizers and dessert and we were all full. Manager was very helpful and even give us suggestions for Chicken rice nearby. Seeing the chef meticulously preparing for every piece is really great."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb sushi in Singapore,50,22 January 2014,"We had lunch at Shinji in the second floor of the Raffles Hotel shopping arcade, and it was a superb meal. Reservations for a Monday at 1:30 pm were easily made the day before. We had the ""9 piece"" set sushi meal, and the quality of the fish, the preparation of the nigiri and maki, and the pacing and sequencing of the meal were as good as we have seen anywhere, including Japan. This was ""edomae"" style sushi, meaning that seasoning is completely under control of the chef. We requested a couple of extras (shirako -in season in Japan- and uni) and these were superlative, but fairly pricy (at about 60 Singapore dollars a serving). So, to keep costs under control, stick to the set course. Regardless, given the superb sushi (and 250 ml of ""Ku"", a daiginjo sake), the total bill of about 400 Singapore Dollars for two was fair and competitive. It would not be that different (in price) from, say, a meal at Le Bernardin in Manhattan (admittedly, a very different kind of seafood cuisine). Only two things detracted from an otherwise perfect lunch. First, the maitre d'hotel was rather pedantic in informing us that extras would be expensive. It's a fair warning, but if coming to Shinji, the client should be prepared to pay dearly (maybe they've had unpleasant experiences with uniformed clients?). Second, the clientele around the sushi bar (and that is all that is available) seemed to be mostly moneyed Philistines, submerging their nigiri into soy sauce (remember, edomae-sushi), photographing each course as it came out, constantly texting, and just generally seeming to be incapable of appreciating what was being served to them. If your meal is helping to drive bluefin tuna to extinction, at least revere the fish. Neither of these issues, especially the second, are responsibilities of the restaurant, but be warned not to expect particularly cultured neighbors. Enthusiastically recommended for those seeking the best sushi money can buy."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A terrible Experience,10,31 December 2013,"Was part of a group planning to enjoy a delightful Christmas Eve dinner at this posh eatery. Our group arrived promptly at the reception just before 7' 0 clock which was our reservation time and waited expectantly to be seated. It was here where things went terribly wrong. Suddenly upon seeing our group, the lady receiving us ducked to the back quickly and called the manager out. The manager , smiling cheerfully, told us that our reservation had been cancelled by herself because a confirmation was not obtained even though the booking was made less than four days earlier. Our host who dines at the restaurant regularly had called the restaurant and was assured of a booking. After looking through her records, the Manager again, cheerfully, told us that the number they had taken down was indeed a wrong number as they mis-wrote one digit in the phone number. What a wonderful mistake as apparently phones nowadays don't have caller ID. They then somehow pulled out an unknown email address and were sending emails to some unknown party to confirm the reservation which was made four days earlier. So our group was left there without a reservation and refused entry by the smiling manager who couldn't be bothered by us by then as the restaurant was full. She basically summarized it as the restaurant had tried its best but mistakes do happen and cheerfully walked away and shut the door leaving our party stranded on Christmas Eve without even hearing our host's full explanation. 'Surprisingly', we did hear stories of regulars securing last minute spaces at the restaurant even though it was full. Apparently the manager will always see what she 'can' do. I would like to say thank you to that particular Manager for providing such exceptional service to our group on Christmas Eve and salute her for providing an experience we will never forget.This experience was thoroughly harrowing and we didn't expect this from an establishment supposedly dubbed the 'best Japanese Restaurant in Singapore' located in the famed Raffles Hotel. For those who are thinking of trying this place, consider Ki-Sho along Scots Road, they will most certainly honour your booking and ensure your party an enjoyable meal with exceptional food which will not be at the expense of others."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Great food, even better chefs and service",50,30 December 2013,"This is my 4th time here and Shinji always upholds the very high standards it sets itself. I observe different and new things each time i come and always learn something about japanese and sushi culture, so this adds to the eating experience. This time, i noticed they have ice cubes on all their cutting areas and i learnt it's so that the fish doesn't dry up on the table while being cut and end up spoiltCrowded and packed at 12pm sharp, this place is very popular and rightfully soOpted for my usual 12 piece lunch again. This time, the pieces seem a little smaller than the last time i remembered them, but they also had different items this time. The usual maguro, chutoro, otoro were excellent as usual. The ebi and anago were also very good. My favorite uni was its usual generous portion so no complains. This time, they added a bowl of ikura. Not a sushi piece, but an entire bowl. For those liking it , like me, it's a treat. For those who don't, oh well. To be fair, they do ask what you like or don't like at the beginning. But i think you do need to know your japanese food before coming here, and this is like advanced class, not for beginners. A previous reviewer gave this place a very low rating because ""it doesn't serve steak"". So obviously, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Or sheService was excellent as usual throughout, the chefs and waitresses all know what they're doing. This was actually my friend's birthday lunch and i mentioned this while making the reservation. I didn't think about it after. Nearly the end of our meal, the lights of the entire restaurant dimmed and the 4 sushi chefs came out with funny hats, glasses and bowties and sang happy birthday, carrying out a ""cake"". it was surprising and hilarious at the same time. What a nice gestureThis place is expensive, but 1 of the few to be really worth the money. After all, they have to recoup the cost of their 1 piece 220 year old japanese cypress which make up the entire sushi counter"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Loving Shinji,50,23 December 2013,"I went to Shinji with my Dad's Japanese business partner. I have heard this place so many times but never had the time to try. Finally i could so..was excited because i love Japanese sushi sashimi a lot. Only fools don't like Japanese food lol it is healthy it is artistry. Anyway, all sushi sashimi were prepared specially by the Itamae and the menu was never-ending!! I will always go back to Shinji! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi,50,5 December 2013,"We went to Shinji for my son's birthday on the trip to Singapore and it was such a unique, fun and special experience. All the dishes were great and with just enough theatrical execution without bring intimidating or too mysterious. The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays.The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance. We called it 'The best place for sushi in Singapore' and hope you think so."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","If the seafood is fresher, they will swim away!",50,30 October 2013,"Ordered a Omakase Wa set at SGD350 per head. Offered the freshest sashimi & sushi while seated in full view of the head chef who prepares your portions. No private table for privacy. Wide range including the melt-in-your- mouth Chiu Toro & Otoro, uni, ubugai, anago. The only cooked food was a very delicious miso mackerel and a meatball soup. Dessert was a slice of sweet honeydew & 2 slices of pear."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good quality of food,50,29 October 2013,We had great dinner here with great sushi rice The drinks were emotional and staffs worked great. The restaurant was easy to find and this got great ambiance.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",average high end sushi at premium price,30,24 October 2013,"It was a nice place with rather good sushi in omakase style. Service was tremendously good. However, SGD260 without any alcohol and it was just the cheapest set, this must be a joke. There is surely something wrong with the pricing mechanism. Anyway, putting that aside, Shinji by Kanesaka is a fine sushi place. But do not expect something world class like in Japan as you won't get the fish as good when it has to fly all the way from Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",comparable to the best in Tokyo,50,18 October 2013,"extraordinary personalised service, impeccable etiquette..I was a tad reluctant to have the Bluefin tuna, but didn't wish to offend my host..but, boy was it GOOD! sushi rice was the match of what I've had in Tokyo..the only other restaurant where I've had sashimi/sushi of this quality (outside of Tokyo) was at Kampachi in the old Equatorial Hotel, Kuala Lumpur"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",For sushi lovers,50,13 October 2013,After visiting allot of singapore expensive restaurant's we arrived to shinji.For the first time I can say leave the money aside. Great food. Incredible sushi and the japanise experience is complete.Take the 12 sushi lunch menu. Dont hasetate to say what u dont like ex. Eel and ikora eggs.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in SIngapore,40,9 October 2013,"Watching the chef to make sushi is unforgettable experience when we came to Shinji by Kanesaka. The chef is so professional . Ingredients are so fresh with raw fish , live shrimps... They all r delicious . Staff is attenative and active . They are humorous . We have great meal. We love sushi <3"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",""" Great meal """,50,26 September 2013,"I come here through the recommendation of my friend and we don't disappoint. It is a little small room with only 8 seats. Food is very tasty. What is most interesting is watching the chefs make the food funding is fantastic. The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is really cozy. We especially like Shinji and wine here. the food is worth the value and I would recommend them! If you're a sushi fan, you will not be disappointed.."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worth-trying restaurant!,40,23 September 2013,"An expensive but worth-trying retaurant!!! It is a little small room with only 8 seats but charming decorations, superlative and extremely fresh food – mouthwatering rice and ugami. It is more interesting to see your food handcrafted with the chef ‘s care, enthusiasm and skill! Its staff is also very attentive. Despite its expensiveness, it is one of the “1 in lifetime” experiences you should try!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",As Good as the one in Ginza,50,29 August 2013,"We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and the same bunch of us had visited his outlet in Ginza a few months back. There is no way we could tell the difference between the two due to the excellent sake recommended by Kanesaka-san. If you are a sushi fan you won't be disappointed."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A meal to remember,50,26 August 2013,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I went for lunch with a friend and we opt for my omakase meal. My excitement begins just right after I step into the dining area. This is my first purist style omakase meal, only fish and seafood. From the first meal served to us it was an edamame puree with ikura, I know that this lunch will be a memorable one.The fish is fresh and melt in my mouth, the Uni so sweet I can’t stop think about it till the next day. The sushi is so good, the rice is warm and kept at body temperature, and lastly and keep me impressed is the wasabi, so smooth and it’s the first time I taste wasabi as good as it gets. I’m fortunate enough that the master chef Koichiro Oshino is at our service. He made my experience there is well rewarding. The interaction with Chef Oshino is a real bonus lot of interaction and joking.I will recommend this sushi establishment for anyone who appreciate a quality sushi. It was fantastic. We had a really good time there, and definitely will go back there when we’re in town."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",More than just a meal,50,14 August 2013,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I made reservations for Shinji for my wife's birthday (a vegetarian who eats fish), and was certain that I'd be able to get something suitable for myself (meat eater who does not eat fish), as I normally do when in Japanese restaurants. When we sat down, it was explained that this was a fish only restaurant, and they had no meat...well, I was bracing myself for a long night of watching others eat! Our Maitre d' (I am sad that I never got her name) explained the concept, the fixed menu, and asked us for any particular tastes / exceptions to our diet - ""I'll be able to eat tuna..."". Our sushi chef Takahiro was given the challenge of making a menu to suit me, while my wife enjoyed an amazing array of fishy concoctions (sea urchin, salmon roe, octopus, baby squid, and several sashimi and nigiri fish courses as well as several more that I can't remember!). I was given the full array of tuna, with my favourite being the fatty, belly tuna (their fish is flown in daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, and they don't open when the market isn't open).The interaction with the chefs was a real bonus which was what made this the experience that set this meal apart for me, We've eaten some excellent sushi (again, mainly my wife) in Japan, and the interaction is good, but there seemed to be more communication here (possibly a language thing), and plenty of joking around...which leads me to my final point:I brought my wife here for her birthday, and at the end of the meal, the lights went out, and the chefs came out with a little sushi cake, dressed in funny glasses and hats and sung her happy birthday! A real, unexpected surprise which really touched us!It was a fantastic meal, we left fat and happy! Yes, it was pretty extravagant, but more than worth it. We will certainly be back next time we're in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding,50,12 August 2013,"There's little else to say about Shinji. Go, pay up and be impressed. There is basically nothing to complain about and if you don't like the price you are simply in the wrong place, it is of the highest calibre from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave.The 12 piece option for lunch is more than adequate unless you are super hungry. Tuck in and enjoy and think about the credit card bill later, it is more than worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent,50,9 August 2013,"This is by far the best japanese restaurant in singapore. The produce is very fresh, and can be tailored for specific requirements. Go try it for yourself."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Still prefer Sushi Kanesaka in Tokyo,40,2 August 2013,"Having been to their main restaurant (Sushi Kanesaka) in Tokyo twice, I really wanted to like Shinji in Singapore. We went to Shinji for lunch (got the Tsuki set lunch for S$125 per person). For some reason, we were not wowed. Don't get me wrong. They serve very good sushi, and from what we learned, everything served came from Japan (flown into Singapore four times a week). Perhaps we were comparing the meal with the dinners at Sushi Kanesaka (which included more variety than lunch), but I would rate this as a ""Very Good"", not ""Excellent"".Having said that, this is still a good dining option if you are looking to eat high quality sushi in Singapore. We were fortunate to be served by Oshino-san (Kanesaka-san's second-in-command) who was very friendly and made us feel right at home."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Hands down the best sushi in Singapore,50,22 July 2013,"If you are a sushi fanatic like me, go to Shinji. The quality and selection of fish are excellent. Flown in from Tsukiji in Tokyo, the quality is noticeable. This is a fantastic place to go and the chef himself is quite a character. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but totally worth the mondy,50,21 July 2013,"Went to the branch in OUE as Raffles was full. Raffles is still better if you can get a seat. Small 8 seater restaurant, the chef was brilliant. Spent 1500 for 3 Pax and totally worth it. The sushi was pressed and made perfectly. Top quality ingredients. great pairing of starters. Abalone was perfect. Overall a fantastic experience and definitely worth returning again. Not as bland as Hiro and not as over the top as Waku Ghin but a place to come again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Art of Sushi,50,11 July 2013,"I like to think of myself as well versed in Sushi but by no means an expert. My experience at Shinji Raffles was not only a culinary masterpiece but an educational one as well. On short notice I was able to secure a booking for lunch at the sushi bar. We were greeted warmly at the door and were seated promptly at the Sushi Bar which was around 75% full. My plan was to go with the Omakase and so with a quick glance at the menu and a consult with my dining companion we proceeded down this path. I won't bore you with too many details but to say that I proceeded to partake of some of the freshest and most artfully prepared sushi would be an appropriate statement. Of course what makes the experience so special is the Sushi Chef. Basically at the sushi bar you have one Sushi Chef taking care of no more than 2 or 3 couples at most. Don't know if it is because we ordered the Omakase but our Chef Kobayashi San was taking care of us only and just doing some support work for some other chefs. After the starting off with Sashimi, and then some cooked items, there was then a parade of Nigiri sushi prepared for us and they were eaten one by one with our hands as recommended by Kobayashi San. This excellent meal was topped of by a delicious hand roll and some exotic Okinawa Pineapple that was incredibly sweet and delicious. Each item presented to us was explained in detail by our chef which made the experience as educational as it was delicious. As noted in many reviews all of the chefs are from Japan and all of the fish and even the vegetables and fruits that we enjoyed were all from Japan. Kobayashi San advised that they have 4 air freight shipments a week. They literally have brought the best of Japan to SIngapore. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and experience to anyone who truly appreciates quality Sushi. This is not an inexpensive meal, in fact to date it is the most expensive sushi meal that I have had but I have no regrets as I feel the quality and the service warrant the price."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Shinji sushi,50,3 July 2013,The best sushi I ever had. Very delicious rice And yummy unagi. Very well done! Will certainly come back.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing,50,25 June 2013,"I was a regular at this fabulous Edomae Sushi Kanesaka in Tokyo. Kanesaka-san has opened Shinji in the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. 8 seats only, magnificent decoration and superlative food prepared by Joshi-san. A truly delightful experience extremely rare outside Japan. Run to Shinji and escape the Singapore Haze for a moment of happiness. Thank you Joshi-san!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great Japanese cuisine & nice ambience,50,25 May 2013,"A truely enjoyable Omakase (お任せ) dinner at Shinji @ OUE. The food are exquisitely done with freshly imported ingredients from Japan. Even the garnishes are specially selected, the Shiso flowers and Okinawa shio (salt). Also not forgetting the best sake, Juyondai (十四代), it is ultra smooth and paired wonderfully with the cuisine. Service crews are friendly and attentive which ends the dinner perfectly. Great dining experience. The ambience at OUE Tower makes the dining experience better than at Shinji @ Raffles Hotel.Though it quite pricey, overall worth the value.PS: Hope to see the Chef will present a different surpise in the next omakase dinner."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",By far the best sushi & sashimi in Singapore!,50,25 May 2013,"I never knew sushi can be so delightful that with each mouth it makes me actually stop and savour the art behind each carefully prepared pieces of sushi and the freshness is undoubted. Exquisite! I usually avoid most ""tomago"" at sushi places and to begin with I am no fan of eggs but this is not that case when i head to Shinji, the tomaga has no ""eggy"" taste to hit and the texture is slightly springy and compact. The uni or sea urchin is creamy and makes me ignore my cholesterol levels. The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays. I must say it comes with a premium price tag but in my opinion if you are craving for excellent sushi then you can't go wrong with Shinji."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great dining experience,50,13 May 2013,The ambience was fairly light hearted. All the dishes were great and with just enough theatrical execution without bring intimidating or too mysterious.With my pathetic japanese we still kept enough banter between the excellent sushi chef and had a great time.The freshness and quantity of uni more than justify for the price tag.The sushi were all very well balanced between the rice quantity. The vinegered rice was well moulded and have enough flavour on its own and complemented the raw fish beautifully.In fact we enjoyed the meal so much we had 3 bottles of sake between us and the sushi chef.It is not the cheapest place to dine but its well worth it as its as good as a 3 star michelin kaiseki in Kyoto.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Quite extraordinary - but pricey,50,4 May 2013,"Agree with Neil French on this one - the prices (minimum $350 per person) are indeed second-mortgage-inducing. But the food is extraordinary - tasting the sashimi and sushi at Shinji was the equivalent of opening - and consuming - an old, very good bottle of Bordeaux versus your standard table red. A new standard was created that won't easily be surpassed.Service was solid, good selection of wines and sake, no one tried to kick us out at the end even as our conversation extended into the wee hours. Incidentally, we had a sushi-hater with us at the table, who decided to go with the flow re the set menu, and thought it was amazing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb each time,50,22 April 2013,"My 3rd visit to Shinji and the experience always brings a smile to my face each time. They have a main dining area and a smaller one, and this time, i got a space at the cosier smaller section. Opted for my usual 12 pc lunch set (they have 9 pc, 15 pc and a OMG omakase set). Service was fantastic as usual, from the waitress to the sushi chef. The chef though japanese, helpfully said each piece of sushi in japanese and english, so that we can learn along the way too. Each piece was delicate and delicious, especially the 3 types of tuna, the uni, the unagi and egg. Even the miso soup you can tell was lovingly made and tasted good. Dessert was pineapple from okinawa (wow) with jelly. Fully booked again for lunch so do call ahead for reservations. 1 of the best japanese joints in south east asia, believe the majority here, it is that good. 1 reviewer who wanted to stand out gave Shinji a poor (2 star) rating and i was offended by everything he or she said"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best dining experience,50,23 February 2013,"Been to many fancy places, but never felt as special @ Shinji... You of course get a 5 star service from Shinji just like you do from other establishments at this level. But something about seeing your food handcrafted with care, skill and passion make dining experience at Shinji extra special.The seafood is as fresh as it can be. The poor prawn was alive and kicking 5 mins before it landed on my plate in the form of sushi...the seafood selection is wide range, from the usual tuna to abalone to conch to sea urchin to white bait to ......The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wonderful experience,50,17 February 2013,"Just recently went to Shinji for my birthday and it was such a unique, fun and special experience. The food was incredible, the sake delicious and the sushi masters lively, entertaining and very warm. It was super expensive but one of those ""once in a lifetime""experiences. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",over rated,20,25 January 2013,"Certainly superb sushi amazing specialities like abalone, urchin and puffer fish butThe Chef who prepares the food in front of you and is obviously an expert isn't an expert in communication certainly in english,we had more explanation of dishes from the prawns that were still alive!The main problem is the food is insubstantial, there is no decent portion of fish and no steak, too much sushi and not enough sashimi, ok maybe its authentic but i left unsatisfied. Theres no imagination just a lot of really nice raw fish and some small cooked dishes also nice but not superb a grizzly bear does a similar job.For 600$ a head i felt id had a really nice starter. In my opinion it doest compare to Nobu London or even Zuma and certainly not a patch on the food served in the aman resorts I've visited.Service is excellent although you only get wasabi with some dishes."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore!,50,24 January 2013,"Went for dinner and had a great time. The food is fresh and the service is tip top! Apparently, the restaurant is so big on seafood from Japan only, they closed during the New Year period when Tsukiji market was closed. The master chef Oshino is a very talented and entertaining chef, and though it looks expensive, for the quality and amount of food..... super place to be dining in!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Destined to be SHINJI,50,22 January 2013,"We attempted to charm our way into Shinji Raffles without a reservation.No way----downhearted and hungry we had no idea where to go.Suddenly, an angel appeared (I will call her J) and said, ""follow me...."".We found ourselves at SHINJI OUE TOWER where we enjoyed the finest sushi the four of us have EVER had!!!!Chef Kikuchi is an artist. The fish is so fresh and delicious ---the preparation creative and artistic.We are world travelers and dine in the finest restaurants----this is one of them!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've ever had,50,23 December 2012,"My wonderful and now slightly broke boyfriend took me to Shinji for my birthday.Service was both faultless and intimate, the chef an absolute master. The quality of the sushi, sashimi and hot dishes was eye-opening - I made the mistake of asking if they had any salmon, to be told in no uncertain terms that no self respecting restaurant serves this fish! The bill was accordingly eye watering but both of us felt 100% justifiable, with this level of excellence you really don't mind."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Authentic sushi,50,11 November 2012,"Probably the best sushi place in Singapore. You wouldn't be disappointed. Expensive. Service is perfect, staff is well trained, fish and seafood are extremely fresh. Make you reservation in advance"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ridiculously tasty. Very expensive.,50,28 October 2012,"There's not much to say about the sushi really. It's extraordinarily good, served in a small cozy room by the sushi chef. Extraordinarily good. Couldn't ask for yummier sushi. However pay attention to the price. If this were in Japan I would say it is overpriced. Since it is in Singapore perhaps it is appropriately priced. Currently they offer a low cost dinner option at SGD$220, then ""omakase"" at SGD$300 or SGD$450. Anyway the food is great just make sure you're ok with the pricing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best place for sushi in Singapore,50,7 October 2012,"Received a warm welcome and were promptly seated at the counter. The master chef Oshino San attended to us and what an experience it was. The fish was excellent, meticulously prepared and beautifully presented. The timing of the meal was perfect. The other small dishes and the sake we were recommended were an excellent complement to the meal. We got a little insight into the seasonal fish as we bantered happily with the chef. It was not cheap but then an excellent sushi meal usually is not.The whole experience left us feeling very happy and satisfied."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Shinji,50,3 October 2012,"Shinji and Au Jardin are probably the only 2 restaurants in tripadvisor's top 10 deserving of their placing here. There are many other good restaurants in singapore that are languishing in the lower ranks and they are beaten by Mcdonalds and Starbucks. sometimes tripadvisor's restaurant ratings just beat on a different drum...Anyway back to Shinji. Definitely a top 10 restaurant here in terms of food and service, and probably the best restaurant in raffles hotel. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the price is prohibitive but if you have to import fresh seafood from Tokyo twice a week, and you have to spend 6 years learning how to make an egg roll worthy of Shinji, they sort of need to charge this much. And yes, going for lunch instead of dinner will be lighter on the wallet. We took the 12 pc sushi lunch set and boy, was it a procession. Like all great japanese restaurants, they don't serve you all 12 pcs at 1 go. They first give you some appetizers, and then the sushi, piece by piece. By the time we had the 12th piece, and dessert, 2.5hours passed! and i was stuffed beyond belief. And of course, each thick fresh piece of sashimi on the perfectly vinegered rice was heaven. And of course, the egg roll which the chef took 6 years to learn how to make. Service was great, and the sushi chefs were very personable as well. Will need to return for more lunch sets"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Japanese food but better be invited,30,3 October 2012,The place to be in Singapore for the Japanese food lovers. The restaurant surfs on a wave thanks to a two-Michelin-starred restaurant linked to this one; having said this the quality of the food is excellent and everything is quite fresh and the dressing perfect. The service quality is also nice and the chef does not hesitate to visit personally his guests at the tables. Only shadow : excessive prices.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi I have had,50,28 September 2012,"Obscenely expensive, but obscenely good. I went with my wife there yesterday. The counter setting is very intimate and customer friendly - the chef makes the sushi right in front of you, including grating the wasabi root! The fish was obviously fresh and of the highest quality. My favorite was the sea urchin (we were served two different varieties from two islands) which I had never tasted before. Visit this place at least once in your lifetime."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Memories of Tsukiji,40,18 September 2012,"Yes if i want to have a tokyo fix , i will visit my favorite sashimi place, most certainly one of the freshest sashimi & sushi in town and you will be paying for it . Be prepared to spend average $350 ( without sake ) and about $500 with sake . If you want to be sensible, go for set lunch ."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",perfect morsels of sushi,40,1 September 2012,"easily one of the best high end sushi restaurants in singapore, the freshness of the fish is incomparable, and the temperature and texture of the rice is intentionally perfect. every morsels brings out the best of the ocean flavours. patrons are seated around a large sushi counter apparently carved out of one piece of wood though i thought the lighting seemed a bit bright. people talk in hushed tones in reverence to the zen-ness of the place. its interesting they dribble some soya/mirin dressing very lightly over every piece of sushi, but sometimes it does seem a bit salty for my liking. it is not cheap so best to go for lunch as there are 3 sushi sets from $75-180, and the omakase at $250. i hear that at dinner a similar omakase goes for $450. having been to sushi kanesaka in tokyo, which was simply mind-blowing with the variety and quality of the fish, shinji would suffice for folks not able to fly to japan for a sushi meal."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best in class,50,20 August 2012,"Food: This is the best sushi/sashimi in Singapore. Obviously its super expensive and you won't getaway for less than $250/person - some (but not all of the price) is accounted for in the produce being air flown from Tsukiji. (If you want something that is great, but less expensive, try Tatsuya at Goodwood Park Hotel where you will start around $150/person). The dishes served at Shinji are more traditional sushi and maki dishes (you won't get many torched sushi dishes). In terms of execution it was all top notch and there were no flaws whatsoever in the sushi rice, the freshness of the fish or service.Service: Excellent. Ambiance: Traditional Japanese setting - mainly counter seating (which is my favourite anyway so you can chat with the chefs about what is in season). There are 2 or 3 little private rooms I think."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",wow japanese is great!,50,14 August 2012,This restaurant is expensive but food very good. We go for birthday night and enjoy alot. The tuna and ebi prawns very fresh and sushi very nice. I want to go again but very expensive.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,40,28 July 2012,"I went to Shinji this week as it was so well reviewed. The place has an elegant feel, with prompt service. I ordered a sushi platter and every item was good and tasty. Pricey, but to be expected."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi Place in Singapore,50,3 July 2012,"Super fresh and yummy sashimi. The chef is very friendly and nice, very attentive. Service was fast. We order the omakaze. U will spend 500 more or less per person. Amazing experience....i went home super full that nite."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sashima you can find in!,50,1 July 2012,Best value will be its weekday lunch. Fresh and delicious Japanese suitable for business entertainment
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you can't go to Hong Kong or Tokyo ...,40,1 July 2012,"Shinji is certainly the best sushi in Singapore, easily surpasses Aoki. Is it worth it? That depends, if you really want very good sushi, and are stuck in Singapore, then paying SGD 500 per person (including sake) is the only thing to do. What is unfortunate is that it does really measure up on a regional scale. Of course, it is more expensive and no where as good as the places in Japan. But, what about Hong Kong? I frequently dine at Sushi Shin in Hong Kong and find it to be slightly less expensive, and far better than Shinji. Recently, I was in Tokyo (ate at Kyubei), Hong Kong (ate at Sushi Shin) and Singapore (ate at Shinji) all within a month. Over such a short period, it was easy for me to compare, and while Shinji was the most expensive of the three, it was also the worst."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A delightful Japanese experience.,50,28 June 2012,"I've been to Hokkaido and tried several accomplished restaurants there and Shinji's food is about the best sushi you can get in Singapore. The food is served with very little seasoning as it is really fresh. Moreover, the chef will add a subtle twist to the sashimi and the whole experience for that dish will be enhanced tremendously. The chef also brings in seasonal food and changes his menu regularly. In addition, they have a list of really good Sake that goes very well with the food. To top it all, it was really a personal experience with the chef serving the food with a lot of attention and humour."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best sushi in Singapore, but outrageously expensive",50,3 June 2012,"Having lived in Tokyo for eight years, there are few things I dream of more often than finding great sushi outside of Japan. For Singapore this is it. Unfortunately you feel like you are selling your soul to the devil every time you dine. Its about 75%+ more expensive than comparable quality in Japan. But what to do?"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Business Lunch - superb!,50,24 May 2012,"Amazing sushi! We lived in Japan for 3.5 years and this is the best sushi I have had outside of Japan. Conveniently located in the Raffles Hotel. The set menu is amazing, its expensive, but it actually worth it with the quality of the sushi and the experience overall. I tend to go at lunchtime which makes it a little more affordable"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",best sushi/sashimi ex japan,50,19 May 2012,simply the best I've had outside Japan. a massive wallet destroying exercise but umami to the max.

However, after tasting Star sushi places in Tokyo, I found the quality vs. price is not the best. You can go to good Sushi places and eat fatty tuna or Oh toro anywhere but you can find the real delicacy of sushi not necessarily from the material they use but how they cook the fish (with vinegar, sugar or sometimes steaming sea eel). Overall I guess I cant complain considering that everything has to be imported from Tsukiji and the price gets higher."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",SUPER,50,13 April 2012,"excellent sushi. I was amazed for sushi to be so good. but in my humble opinion, the price is way too high. almost $400 with plum wines. but then again, the wines are really really good! If you are going to stay at Raffles Hotel, this is the BEST OF BEST OF BEST SUSHI in singapore. 5-star!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ginza sushi without having to fly,50,5 April 2012,The food is most definitely worth the hefty price. This place (out of all the Japanese restaurants in Singapore!) is the place we'll go to when we're craving good Japanese sushi and we are never disappointed by the chef's creations.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite sushi- feels like I'm in Japan!,40,30 March 2012,"Exquisite, small and delicate sushi assortment freshly made by the Japanese chefExcellent taste! They taste even better than they look.:)Charming and humorous chef! He's a celebrity chef in his own rights!Japanese-styled wooden bar counter, brimming with Japanese customers, that's a sign of authenticity and good quality!Great hospitality from the service staff.Need I say more? Oishi!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese in Singapore - complete dining experience!,50,15 February 2012,"This has got to be my favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore!I have eaten there about 5 times in 2011 (3 times for lunch, twice for dinner) and have never been disappointed - the service and quality of the food is always consistently mind-blowing.Run jointly by Joni Ong & Oishi-san, hospitality is at its very best, with Oishi-san's Japanese take on hospitality and Joni's candid, unaffected & warm demeanour.My family and I have always felt very much welcome there.Counter seating - and usually packed over lunch hours - be sure to make a reservation in advance! Some would complain of the lack of privacy since it's a rather communal seating arrangement, but I myself have found it to be quite an experience in itself, and extremely authentic. :)If it's your first time there, be sure to1. Make a reservation2. Ask for Oishi-san to serve you3. Opt for the basic set for lunch (I always go for the 9 pc set, being petite and constantly on a diet, I can barely finish the 7th piece - or the slightly more premium one, when my paycheck's come in)4. Make sure you have 2-3 hours, with someone you deeply care about so you can slowly enjoy each dish, banter with the sushi chef and drink some sake with your loved one.The sushi melts in your mouth, is so fresh you half expect the fish slices to perform a little musical and dance around on its rice ball. <3<3<3 worth every penny. (even though it's a hell of a lot of pennies you're paying!)For lunch I tend to get away with paying $150-200 per head while for dinner it's about $350-400 with Sake, per head."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Ultimate sushi experience,50,29 January 2012,"This is a pricey place, so do not gow if 300S$++ per person will make you feel unconfortable. But if you can afford it and if you want to experience something extraordinery make sure to visit Shinji.The two hours I have spend there count among the most exciting and amusing time I have ever experieced during dinner. Can't wait to return."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Again and again,40,31 December 2011,"Never disappointed.
Been here several times, service check. Food double check. Ambience check.
What more can I ask for?:)"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not sure if it is worth,30,10 December 2011,"I visited shinji on mid November. It has nice authentic decor with beautiful wooden counter. We order omakase. Entire experience was ok but I just simply felt painful when I paid the bill (nearly $600). Of course with this price it should be good quality but I ususally concern the cost performance and it makes me feel not worth for it. As I mentioned it was ok. Food is good, Service honestly so so, ambience very good. I believe this price range should show something special and wow theguest. Just it doesn't make me feel happy after the meal like everybody commented and make me feel to come back. If I am rich, it doesn't matter but I rather recommend to go to Japan and have same quality in more reasonable price even pay for the air ticket."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase the way I like it,50,4 December 2011,"Omakase roughly translates to ""chef's recommendation"". @ Shinji, you get to choose the chef you want to serve you. The sashimi is always fresh...and sometimes, the chef will share a joke with you. (I particularly find one chef really cute! :) ) My fave at Shinji is the uni (sea urchin) which can be served in so many ways...whatever the chef deems the best way to serve it. Sometimes, it's in season and you'll have a range of choices. There are different omakase sets to choose from and I usually go for the $250 set menu (excluding taxes and service charge). The lunch set starts from $75. I have yet to try the dinner omakase set. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore,50,29 November 2011,"Pros
(1)Best sushi in Singapore by far. Another sushi will taste like crap after you try this.
(2) Excellent service.
Cons
(1) Counter tables so not much privacy
(2) Expensive"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth it - highest quality sushi & excellent service,50,16 November 2011,"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. If you are a sushi connoisseur, this is a must. They only serve the highest quality sushi - the fish is flown in from Japan 5 times per week. They have an excellent selection of sake by the bottle & carafe. Service is faultless and decor is simple, aesthetically pleasing and very Japanese. It is very expensive, but absolutely worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in Singapore!,50,29 September 2011,"Shinji is without a doubt the best Restaurant in Singapore! Set in the historical Raffles Hotel you are made to feel like Royality as soon as you enter the restaurant. Impeccable service, unbelievable food quality & flavor, excellent wine & sake menu, and authentic Japanese ambiance. This is a 12 out of 10! Bravo!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best experience in Japanese restaurant,50,20 September 2011,"This was my second visit to Shinji. First time was Jan 2011.The food quality was maintained at its highest standard.Dinner only have 3 menu aside from that so long as you can name it and they have the ingredient, they will custom made for you. Especially for my small children.I still remember when we first stepped into Shinji main entrance, the waitress asked us ""Do you have reservation?"" We said no. She said, ""Sorry our Sushi counter is full!"" Funny... In Malaysia we always reserves for private room but why in Shinji the regulars only book their Sushi counter?This trip we booked our Sushi counter seats and realized that it was a great enjoyment having dinner at the Sushi counter!We enjoyed watching the Sushi master, Kokuchi San who has 14 years of preparing Sushi and Sashimi experience in Tokyo, Osaka and Indonesia, prepared our food and it was an art... So amazing.Mr. Kokuchi not only explained to us why certain fish or seafood had to prepared in particular ways, he also shared his life experience with us. We were like having dinner in an old friend's house, exchanging our experiences.Only thing I have to highlight that is if you choose to dine in Shinji, don't expect you can have high quality food with cheap or reasonable prices. They are real expansive!It is very very expansive compare to what we can have in Malaysia.It cost us about RM4000 for a dinner of 4 adults and 2 children.BUT it is a life time experience. You shall never miss it if you are affordable.We sure will return to Shinji if we travel to Singapore again.Thank you Kokuchi San for making super mini tamago sushi for my daughter and super mini tamago hand rolls for my son."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Second mortgage prices...,40,12 September 2011,"...on the other hand probably among the top five Japanese meals I've ever had, and certainly the best in Singapore. Difficult to balance the cost and the experience, but would I go again? Probably...taking a few heart-stimulants first."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi and sashimi like in Japan,50,19 August 2011,"We had an amazing lunch on the restaurant's first anniversary. The sushi and sashimi were absolutely stunning. Same quality as in Tokyo, only slightly less expensive. Perfect service. I'll go back when next in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",To die for...,50,12 April 2011,"I was lucky enough to dine at Shinji by Kanesaka last night and it was incredible. If you're in any doubt as to whether to go there, just do it. It's not cheap but hey, this is Singapore. The food was stunning - I just wish I could dine here every night. I lived in Japan for 5 years and this was on a par with the best sushi that Japan has to offer. The chef was just gorgeous and so accommodating. The only downside (and a very minor one at that) was that not all of the wait staff were Japanese. But I am really splitting hairs to find something to complain about. One of the best meals I have ever eaten..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great time, but be prepared to fork out $$$",50,3 October 2018,"Great time to celebrate with my partner. We booked 1 month in advance, and need to secure the booking with a credit card guarantee.We had the degustation menu of 10 courses, and a bottle of sake. No complaint of the food, all dishes were memorable, especially the uni dish and wagyu beef.The restaurant had 2 seating timing, and we were informed that second timing was full on that day - but the restaurant kept the number of diner to a minimum of 10-12 pax per seating."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Experience the bar as a starter,40,24 September 2018,"I had planned to head to Gluttons Bay market for a chilli crab, only to be severely disappointed by the running of the Singapore Grand Prix and therefore unable to access it. I was aware that Marina Bay Sands nearby hosted some celebrity restaurants, and I had heard of Tetsuya's Waku Ghin, so changed my plans to go there. I wasn't particularly dressed for the occasion, however the staff greeted me with no difference, and I was promptly seated to access the bar menu (the degustation that day was $450, and a bit out of my budget). I had the most amazing umekomachi as a cocktail, then an exceptional beef tartare that was perfectly mixed with wasabi soy with fine egg topping, then a toro bowl where the fish was exceptional but the rice was a bit gluggy and underwhelming. Overall a very good experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",If you want Michelin Star food in Singapore thats different then this is a MUST GO,50,23 August 2018,"My wife & I are on honeymoon,having got married after living together for over 35 years, so we wanted something different and we certainly found it at Waku Ghin , Top quality 2 star Michelin quality food that was very different to the majority of Michelin star restaurants , top ingredients that had been imported from all around the world & turned into a magical theatre of dishes.Their signature dish Sea Urchin was amazing ! All staff were so professional and attentive especially Kimme .We had the 10 course tasting menu, with wine pairing, very expensive but worth every penny because food & wine were TOP OF THE WORLD"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Everyone should experience Waku Ghin at least once in their lifetime!,50,20 August 2018,"Bar none, one of the top 3 dining experiences I've had in my 4 decades of existence and I've been to the very best across the world. Waku Ghin reminds us all of how food should be enjoyed and savoured. Simply exquisite!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A good preview at The Bar,40,11 August 2018,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit at The Bar at Waku Ghin, with a more casual dinner setting and delicious cocktails. The grilled vegetables with anchovy sauce was simple but well prepared. I also enjoyed the trout and the wagyu steak. Dessert choices were beautifully presented on a tray and we ended up with the chocolate cake. Service was warm and friendly, they even gave me the cocktail recipe of the ""sake-margarita"" that I really liked."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Pricey, but worth it!",50,19 July 2018,"Delicious seafood and great service, but for me the wagyu was really the star of the show! It is 10 courses and then some delicious desserts. Pricey, but definitely worth it,especially if you have only been to this caliber of restaurant in the US and Europe."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Overall an interesting experience,40,15 July 2018,"Service was excellent with explanation as to what we were eating. The executive chef checked if the three guys at our table were full near the end of the meal and recommended beef rice which was more filling than the alternative pasta with tomato and soba. There were two birthday guests and the strawberry shortcake to celebrate our birthdays was light and not too sweet. The reason I picked very good and not excellent is because unlike a 2 star in Tokyo where every dish surprised me and was exquisite, here it was a mix of exquisite/really good and OK, so so. The mackerel tataki was OK as were the wagyu and cold soba. However, the cold pasta with tomato and basil was really refreshing, the Bouillabaisse (stew with scallop, lobster, crab etc) was delicious and went very well with the very light bread that accompanied it, and the soft poached egg with truffle and caviar was a lovely mix of texture and taste. The signature dish, the shrimp with sea urchin and caviar was a good mix in terms of sweetness (from the shrimp) and saltiness (from the caviar)."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",THE BEST,50,11 July 2018,"The best food and the best experience too!!! The degustation menu was pricey but it's worth it! We were here for hubby's birthday and the staff was so nice, they printed a Happy Birthday on the paper menu and put a Happy Birthday on my husband's dessert!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dinner at a 2 Michelin Star Restaurant,50,8 July 2018,"The food is European inspired Japanese cuisine. There are Japanese styled dish like their signature Marinated Botan Ebi with Uni and Oscietra Caviar. But with their Ghin Bouillabaisse, their use ingredients like white miso for the Bouillabaisse with Spanner Crab, Hokkaido Scallop, Nova Scotia Lobster and Kinmedai. The Kinmedai and Lobster was seared at low heat to change the texture of the flesh. The delicate way of cooking the ingredients displays simplicity and elegance.The service was impeccable and an overall great experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Gastronomic experience,40,2 July 2018,"saved up this month to treat my family for a meal here. to be honest, i remembered the food to be better a few years back but it did not disappoint nonetheless. If you plan to visit waku ghin, i think its better not to have heavy/oily meals before hand."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite tastes,50,18 June 2018,"From the minute you walk into the restaurant, you join a rarefied environment that makes you feel like you've left the world behind. If you're a previous customer, the staff knows what you've had previously and will present new menu items for your omakase dining. Yet some familiar favorites must be had - the Uni and botan shrimp with caviar is just heavenly. Definitely a place to impress the date but it's a going to cost a pretty penny."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointments with this so call 1 Michelin Star Restaurant ,10,10 June 2018,"Total disappointing experienced to celebrated my Birthday in this restaurant. When the restaurant first newly opened in Mbs we visited the restaurant was wayu beef steak served for each guest, after the restaurant got Michelle Star we were back to this restaurant again due to we missed n love foods to our surprised was such a disappointment the wayu beef steak became a slice of beef each guest. Menu remained the same, price the same but amt of beef is cut down. N during payment time, they asked whether we have Mbs memberships card, which I told them I had registered few months ago but I haven’t collect the physical card frm the mbs Customer service n i told them I hav ecard in my phone but the staff insisted she wanted the physical mbs Memberships card , without the physical card she cannot credit the points, which was kind of disappointed. Few days later I went to Mbs Customer Service counter to collect my card n told them about the incident I had in waku ghin , the staff in waku ghin requested me to show them my physical card then can credit points so the Mbs customer service staff actually told me show e card memberships frm the phone also can credit points. After hearing my incident the mbs customer service staff requested me to let them photo copy the receipt to help me appeal . Unfortunately, waku ghin refused to credit back those points. This is a so call 1 Michelin Star Service "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Food quite good but Standards have obviously dropped,30,1 June 2018,"This is our 2nd time there. The 1st being some time back before they were awarded the Michelin star. We had a very good impression the first time. With that reference point in mind, and taking into consideration it is now Michelin star restaurant - we walked away this time sadly disappointed. On the whole the food was still quite good. But for S$ 450 per pax and 1 star - we expected better overall dining experience. Let me illustrate point for point below. As background, this was a birthday celebration for my wife. (1) This special event and her dietary restriction have been clearly spelt out to the restaurant by email of which they have acknowledged. Yet upon being seated. We were asked the same questions again ad verbatim per their email. And to cap it, they asked in front of both of us, if this was a special occasion. I wonder does anyone read the correspondences? Anyway, so much for any surprise dinner occasion there. They ensured the element of surprise is gone. (2) The ohmei A5 beef were of best quality. However, they sliced it so thin in the way of sabu sabu style. It is sacrilegious to use such thin slice on the teppan hot plate. That was just poor use of great beef. Teppan hot plate should always use steak cut and NEVER paper thin slice. (3) Abalone - This was soaked in anchovy sauce that was too strong and the sauce overpowered the natural taste of fresh abalone. Another no-no. (4) Dessert - This was the biggest surprise of all. They gave us a small birthday cake with candle. After the blowing of candle etc, they gave us 2 small slices from it. What happened to the rest of the cake - was a mystery. Normally more restaurants would have packed the rest of it for us. But Waku Ghin was really unusual in this aspect. So now we waited for our degustation set dessert. Normally most top restaurants pride themselves of their artistry and creativity of dessert. But Waku strangely does not. In fact, it appears the 2 small slice of cake above was our degustation dessert. Again this is highly irregular. Most top restaurant would have given a complimentary slice of cake followed by the proper dessert set. In addition, maybe even a dessert trolley. So on the whole for the price and the restaurant ranking - the restaurant need to do way better then that. I felt there has been a some fair bit of cutting corners on cost. The grace and classiness were just missing in this place. At the end of the day, we just remembered it as a rather expensive restaurant that does not provide value nor the requisite service.As a digression. The close comparable in style and food would be U-kai tei in Tokyo which is also 1 Michelin star. But this one beats Waku Ghin hands down in quality of service and food. For that, I would always do seconds or thirds, unfortunately I cannot say the same of Waku."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An Amazing Dining Experience,50,28 May 2018,"We had our own private room with our own private chef, so this was a very special evening. The chef brought out a box full of assorted fish and shell fish, all still moving around - can't get fresher than that. I can't decide whether the uni, abalone or the wagyu was the best dish of the night - everything was amazingly delicious! We ended up with about 13 dishes with wine pairing. For your foodies, can't recommend this place enough, a must do in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Delightful experience ,50,26 May 2018,"Was treated by my wife to a great meal here. We had the ten course degustation set, starting with the carpaccio of snapper with bitter salad, ice plant and Sudachi. This was parried with Billecart Salmon Champagne. The second course was the marinate Boston Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Osietra Urchin. This is the signature dish of the restaurant. It was paired with the Masuizumi Junmqi Daiginjo. Third course was pan seated fillet of Ayi with Daikon and Fennel, paired with Tengumaj GorinFourth course was the Tasmanian Abolone with Aonori, paired with Resling Domaine WeinbachFifth course was Braised Canadian lobster with Tarragon, paired 2016 Pierro Chardonnay Sixth course was charcoal grilled Tasmania beef with 2015 Meo-Camuzet MarsannaySeventh course was Japanese Ohmi Wagyu with Citrus soy, paired with Couvent Des Jacobins. Eighth course wa the framed rice with snapper and consommé, followed by Japanese tea. Desert was Japanese Mandarin GranitaOverall it wa a delightful meal"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",10/10,50,24 May 2018,"This was our number one choice while visiting Singapore, it didn’t disappoint. We read reviews from others commenting on the price but I felt it was worth every penny. Fantastic having an interactive chef, food was delicious and the wine pairing was perfect. The head sommelier was amazing. We will definitely return if we visit Singapore again and I recommend this place to everyone."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fancy Dinning,50,14 May 2018,The 8-10 course set meal at Waku Ghin is nothing short of phenomenal. The impeccable service and quality of food is worth every penny and definitely a great place to bring your loved ones for a wonderful celebration.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Gastronomic foodie experience ,50,25 April 2018,"Been waiting to experience Waku Ghin for a while and boy did it not disappoint. By far the best food experience I’ve had in Singapore so far. The food was sublime and especially their signature dish of sea urchin. Absolutely heavenly! Although it’s quite pricey, it was worth every dollar. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great especially for celebration of special events,50,23 April 2018,"We recently celebrated our daughter's 21st birthday here a few weeks ago. We had a private room to ourselves and Chef was very good in explaining ingredients used and style of cooking. We have been to Waku Ghin a few times and they have never disappointed. They have a few regular dishes including their specialty dish, which is always superb. Thouroughly enjoyed this birthday celebration dinner. Thanks for taking care of us."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb creativity and almost Perfect,40,21 January 2018,"We came in a party of 6 for dinner and was seated in one of the four private rooms with a Teppanyaki table setting. Chef was very friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the 10 course meal and if we had to be very critical, we could only find fault with the lobster which we felt the broth was overly tasty that it might have overkilled the natural freshness and original taste of shellfish. Good recommendation for pairing with an excellent sake from Ishikawa Prefecture. The signature Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar was certainly two thumbs up.Services was also excellent except for a mixed up with the drinks. I think the creativity with Japanese (and also Australian) cuisines fusion were superb. Easily an Excellent rating restaurant but the prices charged probably doesn't allow any room for minor let-down."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Food and serice flawless, world class restaurant, one glitch that almost ruined it",40,16 January 2018,"Waku Ghin has delivered all the way on food and service. I made a mistake on the date of the reservation on my calendar and the day before I thought I had a reservation they called me and asked me where I was. Totally my fault, they changed my reservation to the next day, great service.I had the tasting menu (like everybody else) with wine pairing and the food was simply out of this world. My favorite was the Uni and the beef, just amazing. Every dish was masterfully prepared by the chef right there, he answered all my questions but was also very non-intrusive. The service was outstanding... However there was the room next to us with a group of five, yelling and screaming the entire time (except for the smoking breaks they took). It was so loud I had trouble hearing the chef in front of me. I kept complaining and I get the idea that it I hard to compromise between paying customers. The couple next to me moved to the main dining room because it was to loud. I see what the problem I, dealing with an obviously drunk group, however my experience was almost ruined.Waku Ghin is expensive, and the experience should be perfect, that is why I gave them only a very good rating.Dessert is served in the main dining room with a view of the light and water show."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Truly amazing , Dining at its finest.",50,13 January 2018,"Totally outstanding food , a true experience. Dining at its finest. if you want fine dining Japanese style, this is the place.
Jaw dropping seafood , in such creative ways."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hands-down the best uni dish ever,40,27 December 2017,"Waku Ghin is located within the Marina Bay Sands complex, a massive structure comprised of a hotel, casino, high-end shopping and celebrity chef restaurants. Waku Ghin is the child of Japanese-Australian Chef Testuya Wakuda, whose Sydney-based restaurant has been one of our favourites. Conceptually, Waku Ghin is a semi private dining experience where food is served counter style in several small rooms, ranging in capacity from four to eight diners. There is a fixed price ten course menu that features luxurious seasonal ingredients. The final two courses are served in a larger dining lounge where one can overlook the 8 pm light show that takes place at the adjacent lagoon. This also allows the restaurant more flexibility for their second dinner seating. Now to the food: In generally, the dining experience did not disappoint. The meal started out with tuna belly sashimi, followed by Waku Ghin’s signature dish – uni served in a sea urchin shell with Botan shrimp sashimi and caviar. Heaven in a sea urchin exoskeleton! The third course was also a highlight – perfectly cooked filet of Tachiuo with foie gras and Okinawa spinach served in dashi – a deadly combination. The next three courses were a little bit less successful: the seared Hokkaido scallop was a little on the tough side, albeit tasty, the char grilled spayed open Carabinero shrimp was on the dry side, and the poached lobster could have been more tender (the claw was delicious, but the tail was somewhat chewy). This was made up for by a stunning Wagyu beef dish that melted on the palate, followed by a rice bowl with grilled Wagyu which was quite delicious also. Dessert consisted primarily of a chocolate mousse cake – it tasted good, but came across as short on creativity. Service was impeccable, and the wine list was large and ranged from reasonably priced wines to a 58,000 $ bottle of something that I can’t remember and would never order, even if I had the cash.Altogether, we had a lovely evening at Waku Ghin. I would rate the food somewhere between four or five stars, but given the price of the meal at close to 500 $ Can per person, one should reasonably be able to expect perfection – and perfect it was not."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",What a joke !,20,23 December 2017,"Everything is in the title... Good products for sure, but almost no work on them, same menu since day one, those small ""Teppanyaki rooms"" where the Teppanyaki is almost not used, but the exhaust noise above your head is working well, maybe to break the ice cold ambiance in this restaurant. Nothing that my palate will remember. But a paradise for all the people who eat with their eyes (and mostly social network junky).The only thing I will not forget, is the bill..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Breathtaking and Inventive,50,29 November 2017,"Went to Waku Ghin on first time visit to Singapore, persuaded in part by TripAdvisor reviews. Were not disappointed. This place is VERY expensive (e.g. more than Alinea in Chicago!), and situated above a large casino in the flashy Marina Bay Sands complex- never a good sign.Nevertheless, the meal soared above expectations, the best Japanese cuisine we've ever experienced (note: never visited Japan itself). Among the standout items:1) the signature dish (pictured), a savory medley of tender raw shrimp, succulent, sweet uni and caviar. To die for delicious2) the abalone, steamed on the griddle on a bed of sea salt (!), and covered with lemon slices and seaweed, then served in its shell with a savory seaweed sauce- earthy, complex and delicate flavor.3) the lobster, slow cooked in a delicious spicy Asian sauce4) tiny chocolate mousse cake, with a tiny garland of gold leaf, intense, tart and sweet.The young chef who cooked our seafood, in a small private room shared with two other couples, was friendly, skillful, gracious and humble. The service was exceptional, not overbearing, but attentive and thoughtful. We had an amazing meal at Waku Ghin and recommend to Singapore travelers without hesitation. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive but so worth it,50,12 November 2017,This is definitely a bucket list experience. You feel like royalty from the moment you check in and the evening just keeps getting better as the night wears on. The food is incredible and the staff really help keep the drama alive - making time to show you the fresh produce and describe it and allow time for photos. We also added in the matching wines and we are so glad that we did - it just completed the experience beautifully. The completion of the meal in another area of the restaurant was a gorgeous finale.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A totally different experience,50,6 November 2017,"Visited the bar and had a la carte menu. It was a totally different experience! You cannot have this great Japanese cuisine even if your are in Japan. The service was perfect! At the end, we had beautiful desserts like gems. Certainly I will try what they have at the main table next time in the near future. Worth visiting Singapore for only having dinner here."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best restaurant in Singapore,50,30 October 2017,"The standard of the food offering here is exceptional. It is a set menu which ranges across seafood. The meals are prepared in front of you. The wine list is very good. The service is excellent.
There is no better place to eat in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",More a branding and marketing exercise,20,26 October 2017,"Extremely disappointed – as someone who had enjoyed Tetsuya’s food for decades from his early days at Rozelle, it was a total letdown. Of the many meals we have had at Tetsuya’s this wouldn’t rank in the top 50.The rating reflects more the $ charged and the lack of meeting expectations – the food had a certain quality but not to be compared with Andre, Nouri, Odette’s, Blackwattle etc. where we had dined the previous few days.It’s not though that we created these expectations, they promote Tetsuya Wakuda extensively and you naturally make some assumptions.As the Marina Bay Sands says “With its long list of awards, Waku Ghin is universally acclaimed as one of the very best restaurants in Singapore. Tetsuya Wakuda’s masterful European Japanese dishes are created in front of diners’ eyes by personal chefs for an unmatched fine dining experience”I’ve eaten at so many of the world’s best Chefs Tables in the past couple of years and this doesn’t compare.Typically, the chef does everything in front of you from showing the produce, to preparation, then cooking and presentation to the diner – all the while involving the diner and discussing what he is doing.At Waku Ghin, not only was the chef relatively young (and by comparison to Tetsuya, inexperienced) but he rarely talked and seemed almost embarrassed being asked questions.There was no interaction and no involvement that perhaps would have made it worth half the money.The dishes were not created in front of us, the preparation was done in an outside kitchen and then brought to the bench in front of us where the young chef played and then served without communication.In our home town, have enjoyed Raita where all my expectations have been met at less than half the price and the seafood has been even fresher.Tetsuya should be embarrassed – the final insult was the finishing touch of giving my wife a fruit jelly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Worth it ,50,23 October 2017,"This visit was in the making for quite a few years and it did not disappoint. Over four hours, we were taken through a food journey like no other. It was not just about the food, but the making memory that was formed. We were all treated to food, drinks and service of the highest quality. I would find it hard to top this experience and would recommend it if you were planning an unforgettable night."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A lovely meal ,40,14 October 2017,"We decided to splurge on Waku Gin with a family member one Friday evening. Being from Sydney and having all eaten at Tetsuya, we were interested to see whether the S$400+++ per person menu was worth it. The restaurant is located in the celebrity dining area above the casino. Waku Gin is nothing like Tetsuya. The restaurant only seats a small number of guests at each of the two sittings each night in rooms of approximately five. When we arrived (prior to any other guests) we were escorted to an area where we could have a pre dinner drink. We were then shown into our room where we were served our first eight courses. The guests at the earlier sitting were a mainly tourists from Asia but there were a few more local guests. The staff firstly showed us a box of examples of the type of seafood we would be eating. Most of the menu is seafood with two beef courses. The seafood came from around the world including Canada. We were then served some entrees including sashimi and their specialty uni and caviar dish. The chefs then started to cook in front of us the various seafood dishes which included braised lobster, abalone, and fish. We also then had two courses of beef (one Australian and one Japanese wagyu beef), rice soup with snapper, then moved to the main dining room for dessert. Dessert included cake and petit fours. Overall the service was very attentive and polite. The food was very fresh - the freshness of the food was the real attraction. However the restaurant felt a bit cold and soulless ... maybe because of the layout and being quite dark. It was a nice experience however we were honestly a bit disappointed that it wasn't a bit more special and distinctive. Being so expensive in Singapore, we had expected better. The restaurant seemed to lack somewhat a bit of personality. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great as usual, but stale bread!?",40,7 October 2017,"We came here again with family who were in town. The menu changes by the season and the choices were interesting, though we were happy the singature dish of uni was still the same. There was a lobster bisque-like dish which was delicious and I wanted to soak up the last bits with a bit of bread, but the bread was stale and rubbery. I couldn't believe it. I love this restaurant but I was really disappointed by the stale bread, simple thing but at this price point everything should be great and this was a big fail for me. Otherwise the rest was great and the sommelier was excellent, but since our first visit two years ago, I feel the quality has declined just a bit."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The best restaurant in the world,50,6 September 2017,We went to this restaurant not long after it had opened. While it is expensive it is the most amazing dining experience we have ever had. Food was totally different from most other restaurants but absolutely beautifully presented and had the best flavour ever.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Thoroughly satisfying meal,50,19 August 2017,"From the start - cocktails, to the end - dessert, I was amazed by the amazing service, the freshness of ingredients, the ambiance and creativity. Take my money! Will be back here again"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japan on a plate,50,15 August 2017,"Although we only walked in for the bar dinner rather than the restaurant dinner, we were treated as special guests.Food and wine are fabulous and the wagu beef amazing.We were fortunate that Tetsuya the owner was there and he generously spent some time with us. Next trip will definitely be the full experience. Decor was amazing with wonderful pottery from an Australian artist on display. Truly deserving of the Michelin award."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Higher State of Consciousness,50,6 August 2017,"The online thesaurus has 38 synonyms for Delicious, 44 for Remarkable ... I'm going to have try hard not to use them all in this review. This is 6 star dining in city spoilt with 5 star food.The menu is fixed, with seasonal updates occurring around an iconic heart of signature dishes.As an example, the Marinated prawn, sea urchin and caviar is nothing short of perfection. Sitting at the 8 seater teppanyaki counter those who had never tasted it sighed in surprise and delight, while those who'd enjoyed the pleasure before looked at their friends and cheered in delight, wistfully remembering the ecstasy of their own first time.Having been twice now, the impact of such a light but flavorful, richly salted, sweet and sour balanced dish isn't lost, even a note, the second time. I've not eaten a seafood dish as good in my life.This is a statement I must have made 5 or 6 times on my first visit no meter the dish - vegetables, rice and beef. A charming young sommelier guided us through the world of sake, and after a fascinating beginners introduction we settled on one of the houses own sakes, created in partnership with an artisanal brewer in Japan. This was delicious and much like a good wine with European cuisine, enhanced our meal even further.The dishes flow like ambrosia. One plate of perfection after the next. Strangers sitting along the counter all now firm friends, bonded through whimpers of pure pleasure.As dinner finished and we praised our chef, we were led to a lounge for desert. Delicate chocolates, a light aperitif, and a slice of the best melon I've ever had! I know this sounds ridiculous, but in a menu that consisted of the mind blowing and better, this humble melon deserves a mention. It just goes to show that a manic obsession with sourcing, respecting and preparing the very best can transcend food to heavenly places.Your going to pay handsomely for this euphoric meal, and it is worth every single penny. You'll leave feeling like something has changed in your life, something wonderful and for the better. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique dinning, would do it again!",50,3 August 2017,"I've been eyeing this restaurant for so long from IG posts. When I had a chance to visit Singapore I booked one month in advance to secure my spot. I went solo as none of my friends were able to justify the price. In my opinion, you live once, you have to try it! The dinning experience was so unique, this is my first time in a very fine dinning restaurant and I must admit I was not sure what to expect but I know that it should be worth the money! Service was impeccable and the food was, unique and of great quality, everything was so delightful from start to finish! I love the privacy of the experience, I was with 2 other couples and really like the interaction of the chef cooking in front of you and the waitress that seems to pop out of no where whenever you need refill, serving and when you finish your dishes. I hardly have to lift a finger, only there to eat, eat and eat!! I would actually do it again in the future if I had a chance to go back to Singapore, just hope their menu change daily as I wouldn't want to go back to eat the exact same thing again, this is of course due to the price of the set menu. Though their signature Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar can stay!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent!,50,29 July 2017,"Waku Ghin is a must visit for any serious foodie. A very enjoyable dinner with the freshest produce and excellent service. Especially enjoyed the botan shrimp with sea urchin, the restaurant's speciality. I've had the privilege of meeting Chef Tetsuya at another function and he is by far one of the warmest and most humble celebrity chef I've met. Kudos to him for flying his flag high in Singapore! "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The BEST on our 12-Michelin Star Trip!,50,17 May 2017,"We are foodies and just completed a trip to Singapore and HongKong with a combined 12 Michelin stars. Waku Ghin for us was the most pleasing experience overall - and we had a lot of fun on our trip! What was so outstanding about it?- it's like having a personal chef prepare your meal right in front of you, interact with you, and explain interesting tidbits - outstanding dishes!! I agree with the other TA reviews - the Uni, Shrimp, and Caviar (lots of Caviar) signature dish just blows the taste buds into heaven! The abalone was just amazing (and I am not usually a fan);- Sake & wine pairing; we are picky with our wines after some other eateries' tasting menus we're trying to be too smart by half; but the sommelier perfectly adjusted the wine selection and we tried 3 deep Sake tastes; and 3 wines plus champagne. Generous portions. Well paired!!- a huge amount of food AND Sake/wine ... actually it was too much food quantity for my spouse, and left even me trying to find more space in my stomach- a serene interplay between the bar, culinary, experience, and architecture. They really thought this through. The one downer: when leaving after a fabulously satisfying evening, the door of Waku Ghin lets you out on a balcony overlooking a gigantic casino - that was an unfortunate counterpointAll in all, Waku Ghin beat out other, more highly rated establishments in our experience. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional Precision in Cullinary Art,50,5 April 2017,"Simply outstanding.
An incredible experience, the best restaurant we have dined in and that includes 2 & 3 Star Michelin."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Faultless,50,1 April 2017,From entry to exit the service were impeccable. One of the best dining experiences ever! Best dish was definitely their signature sea urchin dish! Price tag of over $500 per person means its definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Looking forward to trying out Tetsuya's in Sydney.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in a life time experience,50,28 March 2017,"Not sure what to write, this is a culinary experience on a whole different level! All the dishes are prepared in front of you in a private room, so no distractions from other tables.
A must go for any serious food lover!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Wonderful for special occasions,50,26 March 2017,"Very personal service. SGD450++ tasting menu is the best I've ever had & worth every dollar. Very beautiful presentation & extremely tasty dishes. Had wine and sake pairing at SGD250++ which covers 8 different types. Loved the sake, didn't fancy the whites so much and liked 1 of the 2 reds, but all personal preferences. Extremely good desserts as well! Deserves Michelin Star! "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",I prefer Tetsuya's in Sydney,40,18 March 2017,"""They say better say nothing if you don't have something nice to say.""Well I would like to say that Waku Ghin was a lovely experience. In that the food and service were impeccable. My objection is with a few others things though. The food with matching wine was $700pp so that was what I thought we would be paying at the very most - I was wrong. We were asked if we wanted a pre dinner drink before being asked if we wanted the matching wine option - a bit naughty considering that my husband and I both ordered a glass of champagne (which I think we were charged close to $100 per glass). Secondly they offered a truffle dish in addition to what they had on the menu, that too was approximately $100. Finally there was an expectation for a tip to be given - not happy about that either. We ended up forking out $1,800 for 2 for one very special night out. It was good - but my advice would be if you are inclined spend that sort of money fly to Sydney and eat at his restaurant there. So much better in every which way imaginable. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A unique culinary journey,50,11 March 2017,Everything was just so perfect .. from the meet and greet all the way to the farewell .. and of course the Japanese cuisine at another level all together .. a unique experience like no other .. guaranteed ..
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb!,50,12 February 2017,"Let's be honest - Waku Ghin is an expensive restaurant! But if you can afford it, I would recommend to go. It has a set menu and you can pay extra to get dishes with truffles. You will sit in a chef table and food will be made and prepared in front of your eyes. Which I always love to see as it's such a fine art in my opinion. We didn't order any wine there as we wanted to try some good sake, as its a fine Japanese restaurant. The sommelier recommended one sake and we loved it - one of the best we've ever tried!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular!,50,7 January 2017,"The setting, level 2 of the ultra posh Marina Bay Sands mall and casino, is understated, chic elegance. As you approach the doors two attendants open them and bid you into a dark, slick bat/ lounge area where if you've arrived ahead of that pointed time for one of the two set mealtimes, you can indulge in incredible cocktail or mock tail and if tempted try a French oyster or two. Advice: do the cocktail and defer on the oyster... over the next three hours or so you are going to eat some of the finest (Japanese) or otherwise food on the planet.You sit in a private room at a Omakase style bar with just six people. Your chef starts with a presentation of the raw seafood ( the Canadian lobsters we're still moving) that will be incorporated into your meal... don't worry there will alsobemear courses: in our case Ohmi Wagyu and Tasmanian Grass fed beef. Do opt for a sake to accompany your meal....it's a rare selection that you won't find anywhere else. Our dinner consisted of 9 courses including abalone and marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and Oscietra caviar. Terrific selection of wines available by the glass or bottle. Once dinner is complete you move to a lounge overlooking the harbor for light dessert and beverage of your choice. Amazing desserts!It is not cheap, but from start to finish you are treated as royalty and most likely eat better than most royals. DO make an advance reservation, and unless you are a night owl, the 5:30 seating is ideal. We left at 9:00!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good Atmosphere!,50,28 December 2016,"I would recommend if celebrating any occasion with loved ones, this is quite a place to consider but price is really high, service is good though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing food,50,28 December 2016,"It was a special occasion for us and so we splurged on this evening - 9-course dinner with 3 other desserts. Every dish was fantastic. Needless to say, their signature dish of sea urchin, caviar and shrimp was perfectly balanced and fresh. But for me, the best dish was the grilled abalone. I have never had abalone like that, and it was perfectly cooked. I don't want to comment on every single dish. But two general comments. (1) The sauces that they made to match every course were creative and amazing. (2) The attention to detail and the ""show"" part of cooking was memorable. Our chef was a young man but so well-trained and knowledgeable that it was a great conversation the whole meal through. It is hard for me to imagine how this place cannot earn at least 2 Michelen stars. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An experience,40,14 December 2016,"It was a treat to dine at Waku Ghin given its rave reviews and the overall experience was memorable. The quality of the food and produce was first rate- lobster, sea urchin, caviar, wagyu and abalone. The best dish was undoubtedly the botan shrimp with caviar- a unique creation bursting with umami and very refreshing. The abalone however didn't quite cut it, tasting rather bland and falling short in texture. I very much preferred the accompaniment to the abalone as opposed to the abalone itself. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth checking out. On another note, it was a pleasure meeting with Chef Tetsuya at Savour. One of the humblest and nicest chefs I'ce met despite his fame. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional meal,50,11 December 2016,"This restaurant is a bit hard to find but if you do, this will be one of the best experience of your life. Enjoyed a 10-course dinner. We had a table in front of the cooking plate and could observe how meticulous and professional they are. All dishes were absolutely delicious and what was striking was the quality of their products: as fresh as if it has just come out of the water. Great wine, great sake, one of the best meals ever in my life. Very expensive though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but an experience,50,4 December 2016,The variety of dishes offered by the place is phenomenal. Every restaurant should learn how the food should be cooked and served. The good things come at a price so be ready to sacrifice your wallet there :-)
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but Fantastic,50,8 November 2016,"There is a tendency with expensive, top flight restaurants for snobby reviewers to pretend the food is only so-so. No question it is expensive, too expensive in comparison to some other meals we've spent $1k and above on (Atelier Crenn and E by Andres come to mind immediately), but several of the dishes were phenomenal. The cost, I'm certain, is due to the quality of the ingredients, none of which come cheap.With 10 courses, we passed on the wine pairing, which we almost never do, but we worried about the noted 8 pours in 10 courses, and they wouldn't let us share a tasting. We opted for two glasses each, and all the by the glass choices were high quality, among the best in the world.1) Hanadai - fantastic sushi dish to start off the tasting.2) Waku Ghin's signature dish - marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Hard to go wrong with these ingredients, and it was as good as advertised.3) Seared amadai w/mushrooms, another solid dish.4) Special - it's white truffle season! A generous portion (to match the sky high price) of white alba truffles went over a potato puree with a poached egg and caviar. The highlight of the evening for both my wife and I.5) Steamed king crab - great show, steamed over a mound of salt, with a lime sauce that created the best crab dish I've ever had.6) Abalone - this was the one miss. The abalone at French Laundry was unbelievable - best I've ever had, and Waku Ghin's was tough and unpleasant - a disappointing dish.7) Lobster - braised slowly in front of us while the previous two dishes were cooked. Very tasty, but not as flavorful as I expected.8) Wagyu w/wasabi. With these ingredients, you can't go wrong, and it was phenomenal.9) Steamed rice consommé - an incredibly elevated play on miso soup - a highlight for me.10) Traditional japanese green tea - a very pleasant end to the savory courses.11) Honey ice cream w/lemon granita, very tasty.12) my wife got what she said was the best rice pudding she's ever had, and my chocolate mousse was solid.Overall, a phenomenal meal in a fun teppan setting. It's hard to meet sky high expectations, but while I'd like the price to have been less, the crab, sea urchin, and wagyu were world class dishes."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointment ,40,6 November 2016,"Went to Waku Ghin with high expectations. With the dinner menu priced at $450++ and wines being heavily marked up, you are going to spend at least $1.5K for a couple, so naturally you would expect a wow. But it was not the case, as the majority of the food courses were decent but not outstanding. Service was superb and almost impeccable, except that the upselling efforts by the staff were on the heavy side. Ambiance is pleasant. Decor is first class. Wine list is excellent. Conclusion. Waku Ghin has failed to impress us: indeed it is a decent establishment, but there is a number of restaurants in Singapore offering even better food while being much more affordable."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",ORDO AB CHAO,50,28 October 2016,"Each course and its matched wine was a building crescendo of taste fantasies. on reflection, there were personal preferences - different for each patron - but the pathway remained as tantalising as the crumb chase of Hansel and Gretel , until the very last vestige.As good as the best - anywhere."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite dining,50,19 October 2016,"We dined here as a couple and everything was just perfect. I loved the intimacy of just two couples in the room watching the chef work his magic. The 10 dishes were fantastic, particularly the marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Great ambiance and really just fine dining at its best. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","A unique service & experience, decadent menu but perfect execution",50,18 October 2016,"I was dying for a gastronomic dinner after a dry period of the last few months and some poor restaurant experiences. So I was really looking forward to this and it did not let me down. The menu was as decadent as it can be. From caviar, foie gras, uni, scallop, abalone, fatty tuna, A5 Wagyu and several other usual suspects to the introduction of new ingredients I had never come across before like sea grass, large botan shrimp etc this menu was a compliation of the biggest hits in the food world. I have had a similar experience in Robuchon before but whereas Robuchon was more show-off style and not much good mix of flavours, at Waku Ghin everything was like a journey of flavours and each distinct to each other. The staff were great with attention to detail and style of service. Can only expect this from a Japanese chef. I dont know how they do it but its heartwarming experience. Bravo, needless to say I would only recommend this to whoever can afford it. Its is $660 per person including a couple of drinks."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakaze in Spore,50,15 October 2016,"The omakaze here is excellent, it's fixed set menu and the portions will blow your stomach away. Food is fresh, the signature dish is the uni with shrimps. I personally like the lobster bisque kind of dish and the beef as well. I can't describe anymore how good the dishes are until you try it. Reservation is a must and if you have to book weeks in advance with credit card being charged first, it's very normal. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Recommended,40,20 September 2016,"Great ambience, great food, great service...... Except for that price, I could get much more than what I get in many Japanese restaurants in Japan.
It is still recommended as it is one of the better Japanese restaurants in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally not worth it!,30,12 September 2016,"Nothing to shout about.....food was alright, not fantastic. Over rated & overpriced!!!! There are many other restaurants in Singapore that are a lot better. If you want to experience some extra-ordinary culinary delight, don't waste your money on this one."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",disappointing,10,3 September 2016,"What’s all the fuss about? Nothing special. In fact for these prices (one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore) it was profoundly disappointing. They appeared to be doing things to win them Michelin stars and to impress rather than make interesting and tasty food and be sincere. There wasn’t a single dish which stood out on my fish/meat menu and the person I was with's vegetarian one. There are better Japanese restaurants at Pan Pacific and even Kinki beats it. Not worth the money, wine was exceedingly overpriced even for Singapore and the whole experience wasn’t especially enjoyable. Felt forced and insincere."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in Singapore ,50,27 August 2016,Food is just out of this world. Thoughtful and skilful use of condiments and garnishes to bring out the flavours in the freshest ingredients - makes you realise great food is just that simple. Impeccable service and one of the widest selection of sake just adds on to the whole wonderful dining experience. Definitely worth more than the one star it's been given by Michelin.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Is the crazy price for the ingredients or culinary skills or the venue?,30,18 August 2016,"After the dinner three months ago, I was still not in a position to answer the question above, because the ingredients are all high-end, the venue is exclusive but the culinary skills? Honestly I can't tell. I can't even recall any memorable dishes any more ..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A perfect experience,50,30 July 2016,"We had the incredible privilege of having a private chef in a private room, and the dinner was a delight from start to end."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Premium (and fresh) ingredients,40,30 July 2016,"Enjoyed our dinner at Waku Ghin. Started at 530pm and ended just before 8. Food gets served pretty quickly which was even better for me since I get reallyimpatient waiting. Don't think that they are too strict with dress code as the couple next to us wore tshirt, jeans and sneakers. Very meticulous team, they give you a copy of their menu after your meal and I was very surprised that they edited the title of my second dish (I'm allergic to raw crustaceans so I didn't have raw shrimps with my uni). They charge a bit differently for water, instead of charging per bottle they go by $20 per person for still water (so drink more guys haha)! In terms of taste, above average, but I'm giving the experience 4/5 as the price of the meal was on par with the ingredients used (uni, tuna, king crab, lobster, abalone, wagyu) - very worth it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely stunning,50,26 July 2016,"This is what food should be all about. No fancy cooking, just pure, fresh ingredients with the clever use of condiments and garnishes to bring out or enhance the flavours. The selection of sake is also second to none. You just get the impression that the owner and everybody who works here knows food, knows what they're doing and are passionate about it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Restaurant Review,50,22 July 2016,"Amazing restaurant. The food is very delicious. At the end, they give you a paper where it shows everything that we have ate. The service is very nice and friendly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Little modern Tokyo,50,15 July 2016,Tepanyaki style in MBS. Always pleasure to come back and never feel like being in the casino as you got into the restaurant. Very cozy and well received. Food for each courses were delicate with the young chef and even its not as good as the authentic one in Japan but it's another great place to visit. Good selection of Sake and wine lists but too much mark up on wine lists. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Just when you think you had seen it all!,50,14 July 2016,"A truly unique dining experience. This restaurant has it all. Classy yet sobre interior decor. Fantastic service. Sublime food.Great desert room with Armagnacs by Darroze made specially for the restaurant and chef Tetsuya and depending on your timing, a front seat to the great MBS laser light show on every evening! From the moment you walk in you are taken care of and subjected to the Waku Ghin experience which is, to say the least, amazing and wonderful. They serve a 10 course tasting menu with emphasis on seafood. This is the most special of ""special places"" and was one of my most (if not THE most) memorable dining experiences. If you pocketbook can afford it (perfection does not come cheap!) it is money well spent for a special experience. Thank you to the entire Wahu Ghin team for a great time last night and to chef Tetsuya! Oh and when you leave, you are handed a memento-- a menu of what you have. Classy to the end!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Date night on last night in Marina Bay Sands,50,11 July 2016,Well all I can say is that we had a truly amazing and wonderful experience at Waku GhinFrom the time you set foot into this establishment you immediately know that you are going to be well looked afterThe service staff are amazing with every detail taken care off with smiles all around making you feel comfortable and welcomeThe freshness of the ingredients used are by far the very best and of high qualityThe preparation and cooking of these ingredients where on show in front of our eyes as we where left in oar on how the flavours married together and left a gastronomic explosion of taste and flavour on our taste budsA huge THANKYOU to Chef Suzuki for a fantastic and amazing experience 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Have you really had fine dining if you haven't dined at Waku Ghin!,50,29 June 2016,"We planned our entire Singapore travel schedule around our Waku Ghin reservation and there was definitely a huge build up to it.. Lucky for us, Waku Ghin didn't disappoint and it was certainly a meal of a lifetime. Service was impeccable, the seafood as fresh as can be, and the flavour combinations simply outstanding."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Celebrating our birthdays at Waku Ghin,50,28 June 2016,"My son and I have the same birth date and wifey kindly booked Waku Ghin for the dinner celebrations. This is my second time there. Our first time was about 7 years ago and we were lucky that Chef Tetsuya was there too for the F1 weekend. Food was of a very high quality and the seafood was as fresh as you can get, though pricings have gone up - degustation was SGD 450 pp and wine pairing SGD 250. The highlight was the uni/caviar/prawn combo for me. Most of the items were similar to the previous time.Desert was at another area with a nice view overlooking the Marina Bay. If you have a special occasion to celebrate and willing to spend, Waku Ghin is a nice place to enjoy Marina Bay Sands."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Exceptional ingredients, great cooking mastery",40,11 June 2016,"An evening to remember. We arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Both of us let the barman design a drink around a single ingredients- sake for me, which resulted into a delightfully surprising result. We had a lovely chat with the sommelier around their wine list and were finally taken to our salon, sitting down at a bar in front of the cooking teppan. Followed 10 dishes that were all delicious, great ingredients, fantastic cooking and seasoning, very decent portions (how can one get out of the place feeling hungry as I read in some reviews is a mystery to me). I even enjoyed abalon, which I usually don't like. Great wine list too.The only slight area of improvement - the staff si sometimes so passionnate that they come a little too often to ask about the dishes and discuss, which may interrupt conversations. This is all with the best of intentions though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but not wow,40,3 June 2016,"Being Asia's #6 best restaurant carries a lot of weight and burden as expectations would be high. To start with the decor and ambience in pleasant and relaxing. Nothing to complain about. The service is exceptional. The waiters are attentive, pleasant and professional. I would give the service 10/10. Now to deal with the food which is the most important element in a restaurant. The dishes are genuine and creative. May by not as one would expect from one of the best restaurants in the world but still there is thought and effort behind the dishes. The taste is good. Some dishes such as the King Crab and the Wagyu Beef were creative as well as tasty. Others were just good, nothing exceptional. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin A Top Tier Japanese Experience in Singapore,40,24 May 2016,"The Sea Urchin and Caviar is a must for foodies. I would recommend showing up a bit early for your reservation as I really enjoyed watching the Marina Bay Sands casino just before entering into Waku Ghin. No cameras while watching the casino players, but it was a very interesting sight to see. Staff a Waku Ghin are exceptionally well trained, and sophisticated. For Mandarine speaking guests they have very elegant staff who can explain each dish in Mandarine. Service is what one should expect of a world ranked top 50 restaurant, attentive, with wonderful presentation. We opted for the wine pairing and the full menu. The wine pairing was very clever and went well with all of the dishes. I would recommend for the full menu doing the first seating. For us it was timed well to watch the Marina Bay Sands water show while having desert from the scenic Waku Ghin tea room. A very high end private experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing,50,23 May 2016,"Probably one of the best degustations I have ever had.Wasn't exactly creative, but the effort that goes into the freshness, preparation was phenomenal.The signature uni with caviar and shrimp was a fantastic blend of flavours. The seafood broth with rice was so clear and refreshing....absolute delight.The service was impeccable. Mood, ambience was great.Have to go!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Talking about Japanese Fine Dine: Head to Waku Ghin… You won’t be disappointed!,50,22 May 2016,"The best Omasake dinner I’ve had! It’s true that it is costly (400+ per pax) but then again, for the experience as special as this…it’s all worth it ☺ To start with, the service you’ll enjoy is very exclusive. Together with 4 friends, we had our own private dining room… own Chef and Sous-Chef that took extra good care of us all through out the night plus army of staffs that treated us like we are the most important people in the world! We started with cocktails. Very interesting cocktails that I never had anywhere else but there… Then we were escorted to our private dining room. The chef took time explaining the 10-course meal he prepared for us. Every detail of the 10 beautifully presented dishes has been kind of whispered to us while we were enjoying them. Except for the main dish which we were asked to decide on (based on the menu), all the rests were the Chef’s choice. There’s of course over flowing sake that accompanied our sumptous meal. And for the finale - we were once again escorted to the main room where all the guests are directed for the much-awaited dessert. Well you can already guess by now that we’ve once again served with nothing but the best. The one thing stuck in my head is the “black forest” that looked nothing like the usual. There are only 4 private dining rooms and 1 dessert room. So it is a must to call in advance and reserve. If you’re reading this, you must be really considering Waku Ghin ☺ I’d say first that am jealous! Second, you won’t be disappointed. Enjoy!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Top quality ,50,5 May 2016,"Unbelievably good food in a friendly atmosphere. Excellent ingredients perfectly prepared. Forget your classic tepan experiences for a totally reinvented cooking discovery. From sea urchins with caviar to perfectly stemmed lobster, every dish was incentive and perfectly realized."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glorious food ,50,3 May 2016,"Still one of the best restaurants on the planet ... Food, atmosphere and attention by staff is fantastic .. A must on your dinning experience list"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fine dining at its finest,50,2 May 2016,"If you are a foodie and have the opportunity to splurge, Waku Ghin is one of the finest venue with a luxurious culinary experience to offer.Setting aside the difficulties we had navigating our way around Marina Bay Sands to find the restaurant, the whole dining experience really started as soon as you walk in the door.Service and Experience: Awesome. I love how there is a ""private"" room where it is simply you and the chef as he cooked the dishes in front of us. It's not a teppanyaki bar so do not fear having any eggs being thrown at you. ;)Meal: Exclusively exquisite. There are no other place to taste the dishes.Price: $1000+ for two and it was worth it.Notes: If you are allergic to seafood or if you (or your date) is picky with food, I certainly would have to suggest you think twice about going as you may not find it enjoyable in many levels."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",his signature dish really is amazing,40,20 April 2016,"With the Michelin guide coming to Singapore, I figured we should try this restaurant while we could still get tables. I had trouble with paying this much food for essentially minimally cooked ingredients. After receiving my Visa statement, I still don't think this was worth it but I am glad I tried it. The restaurant is beautiful. You are seated at individual stations with maximum 8 guests. I found it strange that they were so insistent on us arriving on time as the whole room eats together and yet a couple arrived about 45 minutes into our meal and had an abbreviated version of our dinner. It was off-putting simply because they were SO annoying about the time issue beforehand. The food was good but because it is seasonal, you have no say in what you eat. Therefore instead of the salt smoked Alaskan king crab (which I can also get at home but is still a treat), we were served Atlantic lobster, which I grew up eating fresh out of the sea every summer. Needless to say, no matter how fresh it was before it got on the plane, it's not going to taste as good as in Canada. The signature dish was very tasty. Unlike my expectations, there is some sort of marinade (the chef confirmed it) to the shrimp so it is not just a pile of raw ingredients as some critics have suggested. Dessert is served in a lounge with a view and was very nice French style chocolates and cakes. Was it worth $1700 for 2 people? I don't think so, but I'm glad I tried it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Elegant simplicity,50,6 April 2016,"Waku Ghin is a unique dining experience, well worth adding to your culinary destinations list. Seated in groups of 6 in front of a Teppanyaki-style arrangement, our food journey for each dish began as the chef cooked most dishes right in front of us with prepared produce and ingredients.While this final stage of cooking looked easy and effortless, don't be fooled! The real effort towards each dish is done out of eye and likely before you woke up that morning!Dishes are all deceptively simple and designed to hero a particular ingredient - mostly a seafood.We were impressed with every course. All were complex, elegant and simple. The wine list was extensive and we were guided by the somms with ease. We later toured the impressive wine cellar and chatted with he somms until we were the last patrons to leave.Brilliant 5-star dining."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Delicious Food, Attentive and Personalised Service",50,4 April 2016,"If you are looking for a more unique, personalised fine dining experience - this would be it (at a great financial cost).The food was delicious and cannot be faulted by any account. The waitstaff and chef asked if we had any dietary requirements and would tailor the menu accordingly if we did have any. We didn't and was blessed to experience the wide variety of fresh seafood that this restaurant featured. For me, the most outstanding dish was their signature marinated Botan shrimp with Sea urchin and Oscietra caviar (don't have a separate picture unfortunately) and for my partner, the lobster (see picture below) was a standout. We both agreed that the Wagyu was the best that we've tasted (picture also below).My expectation was that there would only be one chef's table that seated 10 - 12 people, but they actually have 4 rooms, each with their (teppanyaki-style) grill. Although that did not impact the excellent service in any way, I didn't expect there to be multiple chefs serving multiple tables. Perhaps if you are considering going here, go with friends or family that fill up one room (our room would seat 6 people) so service and your experience is seamless, i.e. not impacted by your neighbouring diners.For me, this restaurant is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very expensive, and in Singapore there's also a 10% service charge and a 7% tax on top of the bill. I would consider it one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and would cost at least approximately SGP$500 per person. If you add drinks, it can easily be more than that.Price aside, the food, service and restaurant is definitely 10/10, I highly recommend you try it if you are considering it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best dinning experience ,50,1 April 2016,"By far the best dinning experience ever! We reluctantly passed through Singapore on our way to the Maldives (now we wish we'd stayed longer). Back to Waku Ghin... we enjoyed a private dining experience, with our own chef who cooked approx a dozen tasting dishes in front of us throughout the night. Each dish was presented impeccably and tasted even better then they looked! From the hand crafted ice dome in my husband's scotch, to the fresh ingredients used through out, this was an experience of a life time. The staff were extremely professional and our chef was wonderfully polite, we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with him through out the night. For dessert we were moved to a large open dinning room, with views spanning across the bay, allowing us to enjoy the 'Wonder Full' light and laser show in seclusion. As we left, the chef basically chased us out of the restaurant to personally say goodbye. The evening cost us approx $1,300 (AUD) for the two of us but in my opinion it was worth every cent. Not every dining experience here would cost the same, however we did enjoy some great wine & scotch with our food. Despite Singapore exceeding all our expectations, I've said many times that I would go back to Singapore just to eat here again, so much so, we are planning a trip next month! I can't wait!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A once in a lifetime experience.,50,28 March 2016,"As huge fans and regular patrons of Tetsuyas in Sydney, we were keen to visit the sister restaurant in Singapore and were not disappointed. With only 25 diners per night, it certainly makes it expensive but gives the opportunity for a unique experience. In our own room with 5 diners, we were highly entertained by our chef who prepared each course in front of us. Our Japanese chef had worked in Sydney for some years and had excellent English. The food and ingredients were stunning and as expected, the service was impeccable. Moving to the Dessert Room is a wonderful conclusion to a perfect evening."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sky-high price for dinner, worth trying",40,23 March 2016,"This is certainly the most expensive restaurant I've tried so far, by quite a wide margin. Is it worth it? Perhaps....after all, the dishes did feature all the premium ingredients - truffles, caviar, lobster, wagyu beef... There's hardly a weak dish (for me it was the abalone, which was rather rubbery). Even the simplest-looking dish like a bowl of cold japanese noodle can be impressive.And of course you pay for the showmanship, as many of the dishes are cooked right in front of you. All the staff were professional and informative, including the Japanese chef in our room who explained each dish (he spoke excellent English). Drinks were very expensive (water for S$ 20++ !), and even having a glass of cocktail and another glass of wine could add to your bill substantially.But I think Waku Ghin could afford to be less rigid, and offer cheaper options for the set menu. In many fine dining restaurants, some premium ingredients are offered as optional supplements. After all, not everyone is crazy for caviar (or truffles, for that matter). Many years ago I went to Tetsuya's in Sydney and while it was a different cuisine (more Franco-Japanese than pure Japanese), it was much more affordable, with the same high level of technique in the dishes and a top service."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",excellent japanese experience,50,15 March 2016,we enjoyed our Counter with only four People in the room. the Food is excellent. the ingredients are of the highest Quality. worth the high Price you have to pay.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best of the best,50,15 March 2016,"one of the best restaurants I've eaten in!
the dishes of the set menu complemented each other very well, cocktails were interesting
service very professional"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dinner and Cocktail at the Bar,30,12 March 2016,"We started with mojitos carefully prepared and offering a very refreshing start to dinner. For starters we had the Aburi Tasmanian petuna ocean trout with a hint of chili and the Lobster sandwich. They were good and refreshing though calling it the Lobster sandwich a sandwich was a total misunderstanding of the word sandwich. It was just lobster meat in a bisque with two pieces of toasted bread on the side.Next came the Spaghetti with lobster and Spaghetti with king crab. They were both good but unexciting, with no highlights to stimulate our taste buds. They could use a better quality of pasta. The third movement came with Grilled wagyu beef on rice, a very tasty and favoursome offering and the Marinated tuna (Tonbo) set on seasoned rice. Compared with the Grill beef rice, this was really a let down. The seasoned rice is dominated by the vinegar used in the seasoning. The rice was too mushy for our taste. For drinks, we had Negroni, Waku Ghin martini and a Waku Ghin citrus. All tasty and exciting drinks to go with the food. However what stand out is the baby peach cured in truffle oil. An excellent accompaniment to the martini. Each bite explodes with favours. However, there was one on the mushy side, indicating a spoilt baby.They were many service staff but no one opened the doors for us. But finally made up for in the send off.Summary out of 10 points:Food 6, Bar List 8, Ambience 7, Food Value 5, Cocktail Value 6"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very expensive, but you got back what you paid",40,1 March 2016,"A friend who has been to this venue many times suggested us to try it. It is a somewhat fusion Japanese venue, or they are serving a mix of Japanese foods plus some western dishes.I think they only serve a fixed menu of the day during dinner hours. We had many present surprises with the foods that they served, starting from the very first course. For the entire dinner, there were only 2 or 3 courses that were less impressive; nevertheless, still tasted ok. One of the most unexpected surprises was the noodle in a cold soup with lime juice taste; it was such a refreshing dish after the heavy meal (before the deserts).The only drawback that I could think of was its price tag, approx. S$700+ per head. Nevertheless, you are getting back what you paid through the services that they provided and the foods that they served. Should give it a try when you are in town, and of course when you can afford to indulge yourself with a fancy dinner."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience ,50,27 February 2016,"Had our anniversary dinner at Waku Ghin. We were greeted to a room with 4 sittings. The chef cook & serve in front of us. Foods were luxury & tasty, like works of art ! Very enjoyable ! I must say it is not the type of restaurant that you go often as the set menu is about $500 per head. But it is definitely worth a try if you love high quality Japanese food. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Omakase,50,27 February 2016,Waku Ghin definitely is one of the top Japanese resto in Singapore. Located on the 3rd floor of MBS casino. The seafood cooking is fantastic. The dessert also super felicious. Chef Tetsuya is rank 9th at this time of writing in Asia so definitely a must try.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",5 years and NO menu changes,10,24 January 2016,"Since the past 5 years it's the 3rd time I have been invited to Waku Ghin.My first visite was definitely a 5 stars rating, the 2nd 3 and the 3rd deserved this terrible point.The first visit with this OMAKASE menu, (meaning for me that it's a daily preparation and chef Tetsuya will have a lot of creation and will follow the season), was good even if the portion were RIDICULOUSLY small and didn't deserved the SGD 400++, but what to do with this aspect of the Japanese cuisine...For my 2nd visit the menu was exactly the same, did chef Tetsuya built his reputation with 1 menu, with only 8courses?The answer on my last trip.... YES!!! SERIOUSLY.....Almost the same menu with the same display... But now the worst is the confidence and the arrogance of your teppan ""chef"" that assumed they don't have to do the job as the reputation is established in the 50best.SGD400++ and had a Macdo or food court because you are still hungry is absolutely a joke and a tourist trap for MBS."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",All the gourmet food you can think of!,50,20 January 2016,"I've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney and I loved it so I was very excited to go to the one in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the new trendy hotel, Marina Bay Sands. It was around 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it was closer to Casino and the shops and the restaurant was on the second floor. Welcomed warmly by the staff, we sat in the very private room in front of the teppanyaki grill. We ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate the night ($50 per glass, the drinks are very expensive) and the chef brought out all the ingredients that they were going to use. The menu was not on the website and they don't give it to you till the end of the night (this part was the same as the Tetsuya's in Sydney). The menu included carpaccio of flounder with bitter salad, marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar (signature dish), slow cooked New Zealand John Dory with charcoal grilled eggplant, puree of potato with soft poached egg (onset eggs) truffle and caviar, warm salad of abalone with asparagus and Chinese olive, braised Canadian lobster with tarragon, Japanese wagyu (Shiga, and it was A5 rank) with fresh wasabi and ponzu, and then a rice or a noodle dish to finish then gyokuryo (highest quality green tea) and two desserts. Overall, amazing food and service, I enjoyed a nice interaction with the chef. When you pay $450 per person, it's a bit hard to get something wrong. Everything was perfect. The sommelier was knowledgeable, we had a lovely cocktail made by a very polite bar person and our floor staff was very attentive. The hard thing for these restaurant is that people have different expectations so if one small thing goes wrong or it's not what they were expecting, people do get very disappointed. The food was cooked to perfection and I couldn't fault the service. Tetsuya is a world known chef and I loved his food. A lot more seafood compared to Sydney and I would have to say that the food was more Japanese then the one in Sydney. I had a glass of sake after the champagne instead of wine but I would recommend wine with the meal as well. They have a great extensive list of sake and wine and the sommelier is there to give you any advise. It's a once in a life time experience, but if you go, don't expect anything and just enjoy the night. Ask questions to the chef, they are more than happy to explain anything if you are interested. It's an amazing experience no questions asked about that."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in lifetime experience! ,50,20 January 2016,"The price made me worry, it's the most I have spent on a meal and our bill was around $1400 for my wife and I, but we had said yes to everything and his included cocktails, beers, sparkling water and sake. We said yes to all options! The service, food and ambience is 2nd to none and had the most lovely feeling about it. It's quiet, no music and we were whispering, it all added to the feel and experience. The food is stunning and has so much quality, each of the 10 courses and 3 deserts, were world class and were presented in a way that even foodies like my wife were forced to take pics of each meal. All the photos shown are a true reflection of the amazing attention to detail they show on every step of your experience. It was like a performance, as you watch them prepare most of the courses right in front of you and we were sorted with just 2 other couples, but still felt very private as they speak to each group separately and we never feel like a group or anything. It was the one booking we made well in advance of course and planned and we do not regret it. We took to the 2nd sitting at 8:30pm so I suggest to watch the laser show first, then hot the casino for a look and then to dinner. It's all a few mins walk from each over.This place deserves its popularity and demand and we are impressed and delighted to encourage people to make this a special occasion experience. We will never forget his meal and their attention to detail. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very overpriced, no atmosphere and average food",20,26 December 2015,"Please do read all the reviews in the ""poor category"", they are spot on. We are a relatively young couple (early 30s) who go to these types of restaurants a couple of times a year. We can afford to go (not every week!) but we also expect a lot as they are a treat for us. If you meet this criteria then hopefully our review is helpful - please don't go here, it's a huge waste.Waku Ghin has to be the biggest disappointment we've ever experienced, and the most expensive (we spent twice what we spent at the fat duck, and it was a significantly less amazing experience).Do they do anything wrong? Not really but it's that they don't really do anything amazing and with this price tag, you really have to (for two people, it cost approx GBP 800 or around USD 1,500 - we had matched wines, also there was about $150 in tax and another $150 in service, added to the quoted prices). So here's what really didn't work for us:FOODThe menu is omakase, so the chef chooses the food. At no point were we given a menu of what was to come or emailed after, which was disappointing (even though the waiter said we would be). The chefs often announced the meals before they were served but their English was not great so often we had no idea - appreciate the benefits of having Japanese chefs but at these prices - and not being in Japan - we would expect there to be some way to convey what we were eating and some information about it. At points there were young female helpers who came over -not quite sure of their role other than occasionally to clarify what the chefs had said, but this certainly didn't happen for every course.The food itself was fine - our favourites were the oysters, sea urchin and abalone. The rest was fine but nothing special. To top it off my husband felt pretty unwell at the end of it.WINEIt seemed odd to be asked about wine straight away when we had no idea about what food we were being served (see above). We felt forced to do matched wines as they weren't forthcoming with information to allow us to pick a bottle and weren't particularly helpful (there didn't appear to be a sommelier to talk us through the options). Either way the bottles of wine were so expensive it actually seemed sensible to do the wine pairing at $250 per head - that gives you an idea about the cost of the wine list. Although three of the wines in the wine pairing were sake, so if you aren't a fan of sake then it's a bit of a waste. The other pairings were pretty good.SERVICEBoth the waiters and chefs seemed robotic and not actually interested in engaging with us, other than to serve the food and say what they needed to. You are seated in small rooms with a chef preparing the meals - we tried to engage but didn't really get anywhere and it was quite uninspiring (compared with Burnt Ends we had been to the day before which was great to watch).ATMOSPHEREUrgh. So dull. We were seated in a room with four other people. There is no ambience. I would say this vibe might work for older businessmen and that's about it. Certainly not for couples - not good for a special occasion. Just lacks any ambience.All in all, we would recommend avoiding Waku Ghin. Save yourself the money - this just isn't up there with the top restaurants. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very Japanese,40,16 December 2015,"We began with a chilled soup of Japanese sweet corn with Australian winter truffles and saffron ice cream. The flavour of the corn came through nicely in the soup, not being too sweet, and the saffron ice cream avoided the strongly metallic taste that saffron often brings; the truffles were not overly aromatic, but they added a pleasant additional and subtle fragrance to the soup (17/20). Next was a dish I recall from earlier visits to Tetsuya, marinated botan edi (a large Japanese shrimp) with sea urchin and osetra caviar, presented in a hollowed out sea urchin shell. This was an attractively presented dish that had excellent quality sea urchin and good prawns, the saltiness of the caviar balancing the richness of the sea urchin, and the prawns giving a different textural element to the dish (18/20).The teppan grill came into play for the first time with the next course, with pan-fried fillet of ayu (sweet fish) on a bed of daikon and fennel. This was a very simple dish, and although pleasant and in season, the quality of the ayu was not in the same league as several I have eaten in Japan, where considerable effort goes into ultra-seasonal sourcing (in some cases the fish is sourced from different places according to two week mini-seasons, ensuring the absolute peak of quality). Still, this was a perfectly enjoyable dish 16/20).Next was Alaskan king crab, steamed under a copper pan on the grill in front of us on a bed of sea salt, served very simply with lemon scented extra virgin olive oil from Italy. This was a dish with nowhere to hide, and the cooking technique was faultless, the crab cooked exactly right, the lemon adding just a hint of acidity to balance the crab (19/20). Next was abalone from Tasmania, grilled and served on a bed of fregola and tomato. Although the abalone was good, again I found it less so that some of the remarkable abalone I have eaten in Japan (such as at Ryugin in Tokyo), though the Mediterranean accompaniments worked well enough (16/20). Canadian lobster was next, simply braised with a tarragon stock with a little paprika cream and a shellfish sauce using lobster shells and reduced for several hours. The lobster was lightly cooked, avoiding the chewiness that so often happens with this ingredient, and the light scented stock was a harmonious accompaniment to the shellfish (18/20).There was now an interesting contrast of two beef dishes. First was a tenderloin of Tasmanian grass-fed steak with mustard made from wasabi grown in Tasmania. This was also served with freshly grated wasabi from Japan. The beef was of excellent quality, lightly cooked, but the revelation to me was the wasabi. In the west we are used to being served ""wasabi"" that is in fact horseradish with green food colouring, which gives a simple one-dimensional heat. I have had real wasabi many times in Japan, and this delivers a much more complex flavour, an initial burst of spicy heat followed by a less spicy flavour, with almost a creaminess of texture. Wasabi comes in many different grades of quality, and the one tonight was of the highest standard, displaying a lovely complex set of flavour notes (19/20). I found the wasabi almost more interesting than the excellent beef. Immediately after this was grilled wagyu beef (grade A5) from Omi prefecture in Japan, aged for just over three weeks. This was heavily marbled with fat and had the rich flavour that comes from that degree of marbling. As with much wagyu beef, it ca be so marbled that you almost forget that you are eating beef at all, and this was the case tonight. This was served with more of the lovely grated wasabi and also maitake mushrooms, with a little citrus soy as a garnish; it is more a preference than anything technical, but I actually preferred the grass fed Tasmanian beef tonight (18/20). To finish the savoury courses was a dish of rice on which was placed a little flounder, which was then immersed in consommé. The chicken consommé was superb, clear and with lovely clean aromatic flavour, nicely complementing the fish (easily 18/20). Dessert was served in a separate room next to the wine storage area, with a view out over the water. Granita of Kyoho grapes (a variety from Jaan) was superb, the texture of the granita spot on and the grapes having excellent flavour (19/20). Japanese white peach was seabed on a bed of champagne granita, and although the peach did not quite have the perfection of some I have eaten in Japan it was certainly lovely, ripe and with delicate flavour (18/20). Finally, a little lemon curd cheesecake was excellent, and even better was a rich chocolate mousse made with Valrhona chocolate, with velvety texture (easily 18/20)."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Exceptional cocktails and small plates at the bar, with no reservation!",50,13 December 2015,"I went to the bar at Waku Ghin on a Saturday night at around 9:30pm. There was plenty of space at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan (they used Rittenhouse 100 rye), which was made perfectly. In addition I ate some Wagyu beef, which was spectacular. The service was exceptional."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Extensive wine list,40,7 December 2015,"This is my first time at WG and mostly probably last as the self indulgence cost was a bit too exorbitant for my taste bud. My wife had arrange birthday dinner week for me in Singapore to try the various fine dining spots like Les Amis, Iggy's, Odette, and Andre.You have been warned ahead upon reservation about the shared seating counter arrangement with griddle cooking fashion and the high prices for drinks and food.The 'funny or interesting or odd' part of the whole dinner was that it felt like a communal private wedding affair where all the guests in the same private room had to go thru the same ritual. In our case we shared the room with 2 other couples and had to hear the introduction of the seafood platter and truffle special offering 3 times.What most guests can't accept as in other reviews have mentioned, was the loud noise from some stranger sharing the counter with you. In our case, we had a loud matured guy sharing his resume or career to his new girlfriend and with the rest of the other guests. For such a high end (exorbitantly expensive) dining place, I would assume most guests would want some privacy and silence.We have never dine much in Singapore because service and food value has never been on par with other countries. The only reason wife chose to dine all these restaurants for once this week was because our annual France food and wine pilgrimage was cancelled due to the attacks.A reputable Japanese chef and friend once told me you can teach a sushi or teppanyaki chef the cooking skills over many years but you cant teach him the art of communication over the counter, which is a major pre-requisite for this cooking approach and in this aspect, half the battle is either won or lost with the customer.WG is prime for this aspect of dining experience since it's a counter griddle cooking style but only 3 items (lobster and 2 beef) out of the 10 menu is cooked in front of you. Most of the other food items are pre prepared in the kitchen. But throughout the whole dining experience the chef did not attempt to interact with the guests or because the lack of usage of the griddle or lack of presence of the chef since he is cooking in the kitchen instead, which I am trying to figure till today.Bottomlime, what's the objective of a shared counter dining experience when little is being shared except from some annoyance and loud noise from some other guests. I had to attempt to make small talk with the chef in attendance and ask him what sauce is he using, which area of Tasmania (Cape Grim vs Blackmore) is the beef from ? What grade is the Omi beef ?Just to reinforce what the earlier reviewer mentioned about the bread, I share the same sentiment that the mgmt need to quickly get a new pastry chef to relook at their pastry offerings. Or maybe have a meal at Andre and Odette just for the bread basket.Overall, food portions are small but of extremely high quality produce. I give them high marks for the food (except pastry), but low marks on the dining experience that's why the 4 rating instead of a overall 5.WG will get their 1 star but may be awarded 2 stars because of its extensive wine list, DRC is priced between $45k to 55k a bottle. Heard no high rollers have open a bottle yet.Just for name sake and if you do not mind paying $750pp and share a counter seat, pls dine here. If not, I think Andre, Odette, Les Amis (in order of rank) has better value and better fine dining experience."

The odd bit was the bread ..which, despite beeing apparently baked in house, looked and tasted like a baguette made ifor Supermarkets ! Rest was excellent, wish the lobster stock/reduction would have been more flavorful - the concentration was un sufficient - the signature dish was of course , as usual the real winner . Not a three stars in my view. But a good two stars . "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japanese gastronomic high end,50,3 December 2015,"Usually i hate malls and restaurants inside, and when you arrive to your private room, you can only be feeling trapped. But the food journey, the dining experience, the variety of dishes, the products and cooking quality is so high.. When you are invited to join the common dessert room with (at last !) a view on the marina, you realize it s exceptionnal. On top of that desserts are excellent, not far from a french starred dessert chef.. Service a bit rigid and overwhelming but the cook was nice and discreet which made it globally very good anyway. It s super expensive, definitely not worth any diner, but it s poshy place, singapore, far above competition, fully booked all the time, so just bring your platinum visa and forget about it and enjoy if you can."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","always at its best, innovative .",50,19 November 2015,"The pinacle of haute japanese cuisine. From the outstanding service to the awesome dish presentation to the taste. Very innovative and passionate .
Very individualised service at the tapanyaki counter."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Cocktails and oysters! ,50,6 November 2015,"We had cocktails and oysters at the bar. These surely must be the best cocktails in town, the bartender is a proper cocktail bartender. We had the Irish and the Canadian oysters, they were both delicious."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glad I went...! ,40,2 November 2015,"This place is expensive! The food was great and very well presented. Some amazing produce cooked to perfection. The restaurant itself is a little impersonal. We were in a 2 and had to share our kitchen with another pair. It was a bit awkward and quiet. Wine by the glass menu was a bit limited, but had some good choices. The special of the night was a couple of dishes using white truffle which was out of this world. Not sure I'd go back, given the price but I'm glad I went."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique experience, including the laser light show",50,24 October 2015,"A Top 100 World list place we just had to try. The location, above the large casino floor, is interesting but the noise is not a factor once you get inside. Seating is bar-like in front of the cooking table with several other diners, but only 6 people a separate room. The tasting menu is very well done, mostly seafood and well presented. The one glitch was no one offered us a drink before dinner nor a wine list. We had to ask if there was wine or wine pairings, after which they said, ""Oh yes"". Once that hurdle was overcome, the wine pairings were quite nice. After dinner and before dessert, you are escorted to a more conventional dining area with a window over the bay. While finishing dessert and coffee, you view the laser light show. A great ending to a wonderful dinner. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great stuff,50,21 October 2015,Real good stuff with top quality ingredients. Tho it is quite expensive. Personally i would have preferred a more simple serving of the wagyu beef as opposed to different sauces placed on it
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sea Urchin????,50,20 October 2015,"Based on the reviewers, I decided to try this restaurant. I am interested to visiting this place because, I can taste the pleasures of sea urchins.. and finalyyyy I tasted straight sea urchin ... and it offered a sense of truly exceptional.. WONDERFULL"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting Dining Experience from the mind of Tetsuya,40,19 October 2015,"We booked for our anniversary (6 weeks beforehand) because we had heard about this restaurant. Even though it doesn't quite rank on the World scale, it still is on every Foodie's list to visit. The communal-style dining booths are a bit hard to get used to particularly if you have annoyingly loud strangers as your dining companions (which we did). You sit up at a Teppan plate with your own chef who cooks for you. This is terrific and if you have a friendly chef, it makes for an great dinner conversation (which it was). We supped on a plethora of fresh seafood including sea urchin, Tasmanian abalone (we flew thousands of kms to eat Aussie local!) and scampi and finished with Wagyu. You are then transferred to a quieter dining room to finish your desserts. It was an experience that whilst very expensive, and not quite the romantic anniversary dinner we were hoping for, was definitely worth ticking off the list."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing restauarnt,50,6 October 2015,"This restaurant really is an experience. It is also outrageously expensive. The sea urchin was interesting to say the least. You sit in one of 4 small rooms. There were 3 of us in one room when I visited. Some of the food is brought to you already plated, and other meals are prepared in front of you by your personal chef. For desserts you go to another room. All great fun"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Expensive, but really good",50,13 September 2015,"This is the most expensive meal I've had in my whole life. Despite that statement, it's one of the best food I've had in my life. Since it's a 10 degustation course; we were estimating the cost of each dish, and more or less it's really worth the amount you're paying for. I enjoyed as well being right in front of the chef as they prepare the dishes in front of you. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An unforgettable dinner prepared by chef Masaya Suzuki,50,13 September 2015,I love Japanese food. And I particularly like sea urchin. So when I found out about a Japanese restaurant that incorporates sea urchin into its signature dish I had to try it.The restaurant is located in the Marina Bay Sands complex and one of the dele rity chef restaurants. I enjoyed the 10 course omakase menu prepared by chef Suzuki Right in front of me and 4 other guests - particularly the sea urchin signature dish. I was also introduced to a delicious sake from the Masuizumi brewery's platinum collection. I have never tasted such a smooth and well balanced sake before.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Elevated Contemporary Japanese....good, but not great.",40,24 August 2015,"Tetsuya Wakuda as a brilliant chef brings me back memories of my time in Sydney in 2000, so when I saw his restaurant in Singapore (back in 2014) was on the top 50 list, I needed to go! You have to meander above the casino floor to go to the restaurant, but once in you are transformed by the decor. Very stylish, very sleek. You are ushered to a room where there is about 8 chairs in front of a teppanyaki cook top where you chef prepares all sort of delightful dishes. It was very entertaining and inspiring to watch the process. The presentation was spectacular and visually very appealing, but the flavour (especially after our dinner at Andre) it was not great, mind you it was very delicious, but I guess I was expecting transcendence. Would I recommend the place, sure but maybe as a second or third choice of restaurants in Singapore. The food was wonderful, but I guess my expectations was a little too high."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting but overall not as inspiring as I would have imagined,30,23 August 2015,This was a good meal don't get me wrong. I liked the way you were seated in a group setting (I was on my own) and got you seat at the cooking table. The presentation of the fish was excellent and some of the courses were truly great. But some were really very average. The wine choices were relatively expensive - even by this type of restaurant standards. My bill for one person came to 630 Singapore dollars. That makes this one of the most expensive meals I have had in the last two years. This didn't make the top 5 meals and might not make the top 10 if I go back and look at it. So that's why it gets an average.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Modern Japanese Cuisine with Excellent Service,40,23 August 2015,"serving modern japanese cuisine, bringing new twist to the usual ones you used to have. excellent service, extensive wine collection available."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great Dinner,50,18 August 2015,"I tried Tetsuya in Sydney many years ago and that was memorable. I heard a lot of great reviews about Waku Ghin, I visited, and was not disappointed. The restaurant was nicely decorated , the food was excellent ( nothing too fancy ) and the services were top class. I liked to bamboo clams and steak most in the tasting menu, but truly , everything else was well executed. Thanks again, chef Tetsuya."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Simply The Best,50,17 August 2015,"Chef Tetsuya cooks the best food with the best ingredients ... Waku Ghin gives nothing but the best food and service ... The Botan Shrimp and Uni, The Ohmi Beef are our faves!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Over the top,30,4 August 2015,"I've heard that this type of ""ultra fine-dining"" is going out of fashion in Singapore. I must say after visiting Waku Ghin I can understand why. We expected the ten course menu to be decadent, but with such rich flavours heavy on protein we found it difficult to enjoy much past the 5th. This was largely due to the pace the courses came out - we barely had time to finish our matched wine before the next glass was being poured. Perhaps we eat more slowly than the other diners, however we believe an experience like this is to be savored. There were some stand-out dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed, such as the sea urchin with prawn and caviar. The heavier dishes such as the lobster were not to our taste. Moving to a more intimate setting for desert was a nice touch. The $1500 bill at the end of the night was expected but was it ten times better than other meals we've had in Singapore? Probably not."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Food Heaven,50,3 August 2015,"This is a must on the bucket list.Price is not a consideration, this exceeds any concept of value for money.This is art at its highest formHad the degustation menu with matching beverage. The experience from the moment we entered till we left AAA++"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Visiting Tets in Sing,50,28 July 2015,"Been loving Tets food in Sydney for over 20 years so when we were in Sing, couldn't resist when the opportunity to dine at Tet's venture in Sing. It's only seats 20+ people at a time, most dishes were cooked in front of diners. Some of the produces were flown in from Tasmania, Japan etc… Waku Ghin serves Japanese dishes, unlike Tetsuya's in Sydney (Japanese with a touch of French). Excellent meal… Excellent selection of wine and sake too…Highly recommend"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sadly Disappointed,30,24 July 2015,"I went to this restaurant with such high hopes (50 Best in the World, Friends highly recommended, etc etc…), I was summarily disappointed however. The food, yes, was quite tasty, was it worth what we were charged for it, however, no. We are more than willing to dole of money on a special dinner, this just wasn't all that special. It all just felt forced and a bit rushed (my brother characterized it as Benihana's Logical Maximum). We enjoyed the use of the Teppan grill and our chef was friendly. As a whole it just wasn't on par with its peer competitors we have dined at around the globe, especially given the exorbitant price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive!,50,13 July 2015,"The entire experience was awesome, all the dishes were beautiful, using the best ingredients and pretty culinary skills. Quite pricey $400++ exclude drinks for 10 courses, but definitely worth!

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Welcome to Singapore,50,11 July 2015,"One of our first meals in Singapore after moving from Sydney. Amazing experience, amazing food, once in a lifetime! We got a tour of the kitchen after our meal as we were so complimentary! Don't recommend for non seafood lovers."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Too expensive for average food,20,11 July 2015,"I've been to many top restaurants around Singapore but Waku Ghin was the most disappointed restaurant on my list. This was my first time here and will never ever come back to this over-rated restaurant. I was served with cheap and low quality seafood for $400/pax. A bottle of water is $20sgd. One small boston lobster was served for 4 people... Small abalones werent even from Australia and the beef was cheap. I think with the money I spent, I can fly to Japan to eat something better. Avoid this place if you expect good food for $400/pax. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic dinner. I thought the bill was in Yen though. But if you can afford It. Go there !,40,6 July 2015,"Fantastic experience. Served and pampered at a special counter. Had our own chef. The food was unbelivable, still remember the sea urchin dishes, and multiple creative variations around Japanese Food. One of the very best meals and services we gave had full stop."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Simply Superb,50,19 June 2015,"If you are going to splash out once in Singapore then this is the place. Everything from start to finish was superb. The very friendly greeting, intimate dining room with your own chef, theatrical cooking and sublime food with matching wines -all served very discretely and professionally. Yes it is mega expensive but( as stated many times in previous reviews) you know that before you go- just enjoy you only live once!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fancy, Fancy, Fancy! Pricey, Pricey, Pricey! Despite, Excellent Food and Service!",50,15 June 2015,"If I had to give a quick sentence that describes my dining experience at Waku Ghin, it would be: It is like Benihana Hibachi restaurant but with better food and impeccable service. Yes, I know...comparing Asia's top restaurant to a Benihana is almost profane. The only qualities that they have in common are the sous chef cooking in front of a group of 6 people with a flattop grill, and they both serve ""Japanese"" food (the quotes pertain to Benihana).Anywho, Waku Ghin was a delightful experience, from beginning to end. The wait staff was extremely attentive. Some people might be annoyed with that; however, with the money that you're paying for this meal, you almost expect the staff to give you a back rub or even spoon feed you your dinner (jokes). There was a moment where I dropped my napkin AND my chopsticks back-to-back (due to the consumption of a half a bottle of vino). Sure enough, the speedy waiters replaced both in a sec! The food? Amazing. One of the best meals that I've ever had. The sea urchin/shrimp/cavier was amazing. Both beef dishes (Tasmanian/Wagyu) were the simplest, most delicious meat dishes that I've had. The desserts? Yummy. The pastry chef made a special wild strawberry and lavender honey cream crumble for us. I made it clear to the waiter that I don't eat berries, except for strawberries. This was just in case they were going to serve a ""berry"" dessert. So, they brought out this special strawberry dessert for us. :) Everybody else got a luscious-looking chocolate dessert, which would have been excellent to try. Oh well! Overall, this dining experience was, truly, a unique one. And, yes, most reviewers griped how expensive it is. Yes, it is a pricey restaurant. Would I preferred to pay less for this meal? Of course!! However, the bottom line is that this is a top restaurant, ran by a very popular Japanese chef, located in a very expensive hotel/casino. I believe you get what you pay for. This kind of Japanese food is meant to be simplistic, adventurous, and opulent. My advice is to keep an open mind and enjoy the food. Smell every dish. Savor every bite. This ain't your local neighborhood's Benihana's! This is elegant food at its best."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Friendly staff Amazing food,40,15 June 2015,Fabulous restaurant very exspensive but great for a very special treat The staff are so friendly and helpful especially the sommelier who didn't overwhelm us with the prices of wine and selected a good Wine at a reasonable price The food is amazing and prepared freshly in front of you I would defiantly recommend this restaurant
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Part of the world's 50 best restaurants? Something is wrong here!,30,12 June 2015,"$400 each degustation dinner plus 10% service + 7% tax; now add $20 for a bottle of water ++ and $22 for a cocktail ++... so, dinner for two including two bottles of water and one cocktail $1100!!! Which we would have paid without pain if we would have had an amazing unforgettable meal as we expected but sadly this was not the case. Out of the 10 courses we only enjoyed the Shrimp with Sea Urchin topped with Caviar and the two slices of Kobe. We are aware that a degustation menu means small portions but honestly these people take this too seriously, our Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass-fed Beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi Mustard was ridiculously tiny!! I could even count the rocket leaves put in the plate as garnish. I won't make this review too long but the last savory dish Consommé with Rice and Snapper deserve a mention. I hardly found the fish and the consommé was so light and clear that with all due respect I have had better consommés at the hospital, sorry for the honesty. Same to say about the dessert. Melon? and a chocolate mousse? That was pretty ordinary for such an extravagant price! So disappointed after such a wonderful experience at Tetsuya in Sydney. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really disappointed,20,12 June 2015,we are really sorry for Mr Tetsuya but this restaurant is nothing compared with the one in Sydney. It was good seeing him at the restaurant welcoming the guests.It all started very well with the display of fresh sea food to be served followed by the sea urchin signature dish but that was it. The portion size were very small to the ridiculous size of the Tasmanian cape grind steak to close with a bland consommé containing white rice and poached fish. We really expected more for S$1100 for two people.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sorry, this restaurant is over-rated",30,31 May 2015,"We REALLY wanted to love this Japanese restaurant. I mean it's rated 1 of the top restaurants in Asia! The service was lovely and attentive but for the price, there are so many other fantastic restaurant choices in Singapore that are more reasonably priced and the food is better. We ordered the 10 course menu with wine pairing. The ""signature"" dish was a marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar - and while it looked beautiful, I didn't like it. I think it was one of those dishes that you either love or hate. For such as spendy place, I wanted to eat food that really wow'ed me. The closest I got to ""wow"" was the wagyu roll with fresh wasabi (delicious) and the abalone with pasta. One of our waiters kept telling us this was a French restauratn - there is just no way! It is totally Japanese and I'm sorry to say that the food is over-rated."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best Japanese Restaurant in the World,50,19 May 2015,"This is an absolute MUST! If you like Japanese cuisine (and even if you don't), you just have to go there. Each course is amazingly designed, both visually and in terms of taste, can be accompanied with wine or sake (huge selection available for both) and will have you taste Japanese food in a new way!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Unique experience,50,19 May 2015,"This was one of the best dinner I have ever had!In the beginning it was difficult to find the place. You need to take an elevator, which is somewhat hidden to level 4 the atrium. Make sure you know where it is.Once you are there it is a special, sophisticated atmosphere. The service is high class Asian style, which from my point of view is much better than western type. It makes the guest feel very special and is never annoying.Going into the separe you are seated at a big counter in front of the teppan grill, where we were in total four people. Even it is a counter, there is much space and privacy. We were seated with two other people, but we still felt comfortable.And now the food, the reason why you should go to this place, it was outrageous, just unique! A 10 course menu, mainly seafood, just one Kobe beef dish, but definitely great. It's a mix of Japanese and high European cuisine. The dishes build up well. The highlight, which are many, were the signatory dish, raw botan shrimp, sea urchin and oscietra caviar. New Zealand scampi with gnocchi, so pure and delicious. Tasmanian abalone with a type of risotto. My favourite, slowly braised Canadian lobster. It was so tender and the sauce to deep in complexity, this was one of the best dishes I ever had, and the best lobster I have ever eaten. The taste of slowly cooked made it so special, besides the quality obviously. Incredible! The Kobe beef was served with fresh wasabi from the root, very special, I never had this before.And the desert were very good as well, it is served in another area with nice views on the marinha bay. For drinks, as usual in Singapore, alcohol is expensive. Instead of having four glasses of wine for a hundred dollar, you should take a full bottle for the same price. There is a good choice, we took a new zeeland white wine, there was only one. I like the mineral taste of this type and it was good.This was a definitively expensive experience, but worthwhile the full experience. If you can afford it, and you like high quality seafood you will be overwhelmed in this place. Go there! Next time I am in Singapore I will make sure to return. A unique experience, with world class seafood!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic,50,26 April 2015,This is a MUST in Singapore. The food is spectacular and interestingly composed. Service and presentation was exceptional. View from the post dining room great too which allows you to chill and talk. Problem is getting a reservation.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",On my best 3 restaurant,50,23 April 2015,Since I step in the restaurant till the goodbye I had one of my best food and hospitality experience. Beside a great meal execute to perfection and great attention to details the balance of the dish was great. A linear crescendo that I really appreciate. Service was discrete but present at the right moment. Polite and with a smile that make thinks always better. Definitely in my best 3 restaurant since today. Thanks for the great experience. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Every course was incredible,50,8 April 2015,"I'm rating this restaurant 5 stars based on solely the food and service.
The food was incredible. To be honest I could hardly pronounce any of the ingredients, but the waitstaff who hand delivered our plates to us described exactly what they used."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive for average food,20,6 April 2015,"Second time round - why didn't I learn from my first experience? - both times were equally disappointing. Its about 500/pax if you dont have a lot of drinks. The food was nothing special - the gimmick is that they cook some dishes in front of like a teppanyaki - but it does mean if you are a couple, the timing of your dishes matches the other couple in the room. Their special is the uni, botan and cavier dish -but standard has dropped from last time because my first time round it was the only earth-shattering dish but this time it was less creamy, didn't blend as well and therefore forgettable. All the dishes were forgettable except for the wagyu beef which was the only good dish in the entire 10 menu. Completely disappointing"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great ingredients and faultless service,40,28 March 2015,"Online booking is a breeze and the email responses are rapid and thorough. The restaurant takes seatings for dinner only at 6.30pm and 8.30pm. Menu is a 10-item degustation where dietary restrictions are entertained. There is a bar outside and drinks can be brought into the restaurant proper. There are 2 private rooms/cooking stations where 7-8 guests sit at a table in front of a chef. The fresh seafood ingredients are presented to diners for their admiration before dinner starts. Diners are offered still, sparkling or mineral water with free flow over the evening for a fixed price per person. We had the famed botan shrimp with uni and caviar, abalone, scampi and lobster. A thin piece of ohmi beef was also on the menu. The Japanese chef was polite but not completely comprehensible. We enjoyed his cooking techniqes. At one point we were politely advised by a member of the wait staff not to take videos of the cooking, but that still photos were fine. After the savoury dishes diners then are invited to a lounge for desserts, where desserts, petit fours and coffee/tea are served to round off the meal. I found the food tasty and well-presented, although I think it is hard to go wrong with the premium ingredients used. I did not find the dishes exceptional in creativity - no real 'wow' factor. All in all, was happy I came, but do not think it's worth coming again in view of the price! One can get excellent Japanese (and other food) for a fraction of the cost with equivalent satisfaction."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Top 20 best in Asia,50,26 March 2015,Abit pricy $400++ pp but if you love seafood then this place is to be ...

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",a rarely 4.5 star for a japanese restaurant in Sg,40,21 March 2015,"it is extremely close to a full marks minus some of its logistic timing arrangement (fixed 8pm or 530pm dinner timing w totally no lunch timing) and limited window view , as well as some limited choices of wine/sake (some options only have a whole bottle rather than in per glass charging)Its standard is well-maintained from service to pleasant-looking & attentive staff (well diverse of races). Not to mention its standards in Culinary: primarily focused on most japanese-imported stuff with fusion. Freshness, Fine dining...They could be even more daring in their attempt, i felt safe but i would love to see some risks...All of us love the tenderness of its bread (little things score!) , and then its caviar, boston lobster, sea urchin, the honeydew is fibrous w natural sweetness...(two types of beef : Ohmi beef and sorry i forgot the other one)The abalone from aust didnt really fare on the highest range of scores...We can ask for another round of bread or cold dish too, however it is just too filling, though the meal is served only in degustation form(Side point: Luv their signage of their lavatories )Do NOT step in if you do not have S$500 per pax....is that why the server is shocked that i m a Singaporean (yet not a paid food critic)?"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Seriously!!!!,30,17 March 2015,"Was the experience relatively enjoyable? Yes. Was it worth $800 per person?No. Adjectives that come to mind. Pretentious & deceitful. Pretentious I was expecting. Deceitful not so much. On arrival we were offered Dom champagne in a gestural manner that implied it was on the house! The bottle was already open! It then appeared on the bill as a $550.000 open alcohol item! You would be right to think that our asking would be a sensible thing to do - but the feeling is 'if you have to ask, you shouldn't be there'. Any way, my advice: If your being shouted - go.If you feel the need to be showy - go If spending $1600 per couple on dinner is chum change - goYou are a major foodie - go If you do not fit into the above - don't go."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent romantic dinner,50,12 March 2015,"What more can you ask for in a restaurant when the chefs, service and food made me look like the perfect husband I am. My wife could not stop raving about our experience at Waku Ghin and the price tag was not an issue after our luck at the pontoon table. Perfect end to our weekend at sands."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great,50,4 March 2015,"This was a great experience with a good concept.For the savoury dishes, you are seated in a communal room that seats 4 with a chef who prepares some of the dishes in front of you on the grill. The chef was very personable and explained the dishes thoroughly and the staff provided great service.For the dessert courses, you are moved into the main restaurant area which over looks Marina Bay. The cost is $400 (not including 7% gst and 10% service charge), however is well worth it as it is a unique experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can't describe how good this place is,50,3 March 2015,"Being a harsh critic and being to so many fine dining restaurants in the world this tops the list.Starting with the service, the chefs, the food and the atmosphere.Yes it's expensive but 100% you will not experience this again unless you come here.10/10 and if we come back to Singapore we would be sure on making a reservation. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food experience,50,1 March 2015,"The concept is nice, the chef is cooking in front of you, you get the see the products before they are cooked, everything is perfect even if the seating is not very sociable as guests are aligned in front of the cooking table so difficult to interact with the other person but the one next to you. The food was absolutely amazing and so was the wine. At the end of the meal you are taking to a salon to have your dessert and coffee. The cake was really good ( not often the case in Asia !!!) and the staff is really helpful and friendly. It does come with an hefty bill to match though so be prepared to spend some serious cash to have this amazing experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Double Celebration justifies the price...,50,19 February 2015,"Was there to celebrate wife's birthday with her favourite niece, nephew and spouses. Interesting that the chopsticks were visibly damp - reason is to prevent food from sticking and apparently it's also a Japanese welcome. Food, ambience and service are as described by the other reviews.. price too. We thoroughly enjoyed the recommended sake and champagne! Thoughtful of them to provide a dainty birthday cake but even more thoughtful was an additional Anniversary dessert - they probably took the cue from our noisy Yam Sengs... much appreciated."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A real dining experience!,50,10 February 2015,"This was one of my best meals ever! I had been to Tetsuya's restaurant in Sydney and was blown away by that experience, so I thought I would treat my girlfriend to a dinner at Waku Ghin. The meal was an amazing experience. The service was exceptional and the professionalism of the staff was impressive. We were lucky to get a great table where the Sous Chef himself cooked for us! Wow! No menu, beautiful seafood that is presented to you prior to your dinner, and course after course of wonderfully cooked and unadulterated food! The attention to detail is amazing! From the choice of tableware, ingredients, to even serving Gyokuro tea! My hat goes off! The sake sommelier was an extremely nice touch also! Would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore. The highlight of the meal for me was definitely the urchins!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Romantic dinner ,40,1 February 2015,Took my wife for a treat - amazing food - equally amazing bill. From a culinary point of view really enjoyable but just so hard to justify the crazy bill.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The best dinner yet!,50,29 January 2015,"Yep, this is the one. The food was exceptional. The service impeccable. The chef friendly, knowledgable and very skilful. Don't eat all day so you can saviour the food. Testuya has well and truly excelled himself in this Japanese inspired restaurant."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant meal and experience!,50,24 January 2015,"Well worth the accolade of 7th best resturant in Asia (San Pellegrino) the preparation, ingredients and quality of cooking is top notch. A very different experience to Tetsuyas in Sydney, but that's what's great about it, it's not a Nobu style cut and paste job. Very well thought out. High attention to detail. Don't miss a cocktail at the bar before your meal!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of my Favourite Dining experiences!,50,14 January 2015,"Waku Ghin was one of the best meals I've had in my life - completely memorable.Having dined at many michelin/san pellegrino top 50 restaurants/hatted, usually most meals blur together making it hard to remember.Per Se is probably my favourite restaurant and one that i remember clearly and Waku Ghin is probably up there also.The food was amazing, the showmanship and experience made it a wonderful night out."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",High quality dining experience!,40,1 January 2015,"Even though it was quite pricey, we had a great time as the chef was very friendly and the ingredients were extremely fresh and unique. The highlight was the sea urchin with caviar! Heavenly! Would definitely come back again!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",In two minds,40,26 December 2014,"Loved the concept - personal chef etc - and their were some standout dishes (Sea urchin, Caviar). As a total dining experience though, just fell short of being ""wow"". Great, but not in our top 10."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",As expected,50,24 December 2014,"Having had the opportunity to visit Tetsuya's Tetsuya's in Sydney twice I did not want to miss the chance to visit this Singapore location. I was not disappointed. Food was innovatively prepared, well tasting- and served. Service was attentive and well executed. Seating might not suit everybody. Nothing to complain about."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Again and again... And again.. The best restaurant in the world...,50,7 December 2014,"After probably over 10 diners at Waku Ghin the last 3 years, it is each time the best gastronomic experience in the world...again and again and again..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Special Occasion,40,30 November 2014,"The entire experience is fantastic. The doors are opened as you walk in, the preparation of the first drink in proper Japanese perfection, the courteous nature of the staff, the chefs. And then the food - impeccable, sublime, heavenly. Expensive - but worth every cent for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Average ,30,20 November 2014,"With so many other places to have good japanese food in singapore (which aren't cheap either), this restaurant is really expensive!! Perhaps it's the fact that its in Mbs. But it's not bad, it's more for the atmosphere than the food I would say"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting concept,50,20 November 2014,"The concept of the restaurant is that you sort of have your own personal chef who caters to your culinary needs. Unfortunately if you are only two you will be seated with strangers, so if privacy is an issue you should probably take it up with management beforehand. The young chef was knowledgeable and combined service with excellent cooking. The menu is varied. The chef explained the concept is French cuisine with a Japanese twist, but for my western taste it seemed more Japanese to me. I loved their sea urchin creation and could eat easily ten of them. You can enjoy a laser show during dessert if you get the timing right, the laser show was at 21:00."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Highly recommended!,50,16 November 2014,"Nice arrival at the foyer from Marina Sands Mall where you can see the interior of the Casino.Great reception from the staff. Placed in a private dinning room at the chef's table!Amazing Japanese fusion kitchen where we were offered a 12 course dinner based in the best quality ingredients presented upon arrival!Perfect combination of flavors, and portions! Impeccable presentation!Pricy but worth every penny!!!Highly recommended!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore,50,15 November 2014,"I was here for a birthday treat given by my husband. A few dishes stood out in particular. 1. Fresh oyster given an Asian dressing (Alas, I have forgotten the names of the dishes) I would have never thought to pair oyster with vinegar. That was brilliant.2. Smoked eggplant. I would never have thought eggplant could taste like this. The smokiness that came along with the eggplant was sublime.3. Omi beef. Need I say more?4. Scampi. It was juicy, fleshy, tasty... I don't know if I could use any more adjectives for this.The gyokuro served at the end of the meal was a lovely touch.The only dish that we were a little disappointed with was the uni with caviar. Perhaps, the earlier dishes have built the expectations too high for this signature dish. Or perhaps, we were too used to the uni served at the sushi-yas. It did not suit my palate.Otherwise, it was a fantastic meal with impeccable service at Waku Ghin. This restaurant is easily one of the best in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Over rated and very expensive,30,30 October 2014,"The place has very nice ambiance. Foods are just average but very pricey. The service ws very good. Tried it once, guess that's enough for me."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally overrated - nothing special,20,26 October 2014,"The style of dining here is interesting. The courses are comprised of excellent quality ingredients, and some are reasonably enjoyable. The sommelier is terrible, and showed no indication of having any knowledge of wine whatsoever - best to make your own choices. Deserts well below average. Overall, very disappointing even without regard to the cost of dining here. There are much better options in Singapore (including, as the last reviewer suggested, The Tippling Club, and Tetsuya's in Sydney is streets ahead."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakase tepanyaki,50,18 October 2014,"It's very delicious, very simple, and only omakase. Reservation is tough though.. Very difficult but it's worth every penny. The appetizer is good, the Sea urchin appetizer is excellent, one of the signature dish. Everything is awesome."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth the experience,40,8 October 2014,"Our favourite meal in Singapore. Ever. Yes, it's expensive, but you get over it and realise you just had an out-of-body experience of raw (and perhaps blow-torched) fish. We were awed by the chef's before we even tasted the food. Then we ordered and ate. Then we told the chef to serve us whatever. It was awesome experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Don't believe the hype. Go to the Tippling Club instead.,10,8 October 2014,"We had high expectations of this restaurant on the basis of glowing reviews and previous positive meals at Tetsuya's in Sydney but sadly these were ill founded. The meal was good for the most part but not great but certainly not worth $400 per head. The 10 course menu is very meagre and small items which would usually be considered amuse bouche or palate cleansers are included as full courses. 2 or 3 of the dishes were memorable but not knock-out, including the kobe beef though this could also have been down to the fact that the portion size was so small - only half a small steak each. Dessert was small (notice a theme here!) and slightly boring. The options for those with dietary restrictions are also unspectacular and lacking in variety. My husband's first two substitute dishes looked identical. In addition, they were not prepared on the teppan and appeared from a hidden kitchen leaving diners with restrictions feeling less carefully catered for and therefore distinctly unloved. The sommelier had no idea about the wine selection and suggested entirely inappropriate but expensive wines despite a very careful description of what we wanted. Overall, a very disappointing experience. We had been fortunate enough to have a superb meal at The Tippling Club in Tanjong Pagar a few days beforehand which was truly spectacular and less than 2/3 of the price of Waku Ghin. If you want something really special, head to The Tippling Club instead and ask for a seat at the counter where you'll see some really interesting cooking in their open plan kitchen."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Memeorable Meal,40,3 October 2014,"Perched above the Marina Bay Sands casino gaming tables is this small twent five seater restaurant Waku Ghin from chef Tetsuya Wakuda. Every diner will end up with there personal chef. If the sea urchin starter with prawn and caviar is on the menu then you are in for a treat, the canadian lobster was mouth watering, so was the abalone from Tasmania, the wagu beef was sublime. Waku Ghin is restauarnt that Tets always wanted where he can source the best produce from every corner of the world. Start with a martini, the beverage list is well curated, with a fine sake selection. This is a world class restaurant."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Relax, it's only food",40,3 October 2014,"Highly anticipated, our visit was a little disappointing. From the hidden entrance into an almost dark room (sigh) which is way too self conscious and makes you feel like unworthy when you for stumble blindly into the nearest chair in front of a load of snobbish casino goers to the mini-restaurant rooms with 5 bar stools (err uncomfortable, I'm spending a fortune I want a chair back and not to get varicose veins) it was all a bit much. Yes some of the food was very delicious (the beef, some other stuff) but the famous sea urchin, well I literally had to gag it down. The wine pairings were good. We paid about $1800. It's too much for what it just faffed around food. Unless you are a food blogger I'd say don't bother"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Remarkable experience, everything was just perfect.",50,7 September 2014,"This is my second time at a Tetsuya joint and I can honestly say that it just keeps getting better. My first experience was at Tetsuya's Sydney for my birthday and everything was just amazing! So when I heard/read that Waku Ghin was rated even higher I knew we had to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday there. Booking was done via email and the team at Waku Ghin made it very easy. There are 2 seatings every night, 5.30pm and 8.00pm. We opted for the latter and the session usually runs for a minimum of 3 hours. 10 courses in total which includes the petit fours and a dessert. There were 5 of us in attendance and it worked out to be around $672 per person including GST and drinks. We were originally planning on wine pairing but that entails 5 glasses (1 litre) per person and that was simply too much for mum and grandaunt.They don't encourage sharing as there would be an additional fee to do so. Instead, we chose 4 glasses per the sommelier's recommendation: Champagne, chilled Sake, White and Red. My dad and I highly recommend this experience as we believe it heightens the once of a kind dining experience. I have to admit I had my reservations about some of the dishes. Just by browsing a couple of reviews I could tell that the sea urchin and abalone are star/staple dishes. I'm not a big fan of either (Sea Urchin in Tsukiji Market and Abalone at various Chinese New Year functions) and I was really worried I would not fully enjoy myself!At the start of the session, each dining party is assigned a personal chef and in turn they will showcase the live array of seafood we were to consume that night. Live, because they started wriggling right in from of my eyes. Honestly, the sea urchin was mind blowing! There was no taste of the ocean nor was there any imperfections with the dish. It was silk on our tongues and fragrant on our palate. Without giving away too much, the abalone was scored thinly and cooked to perfection. The marbling on the Wagyu beef was crazy (but that was to be expected at a place like Waku Ghin) and Chef Masa barely seasoned it before lightly searing it on each side. Writing this review was harder than I thought it would be because the experience was amazing but at the same time I didn't want to give away too much. I believe there should be an element of surprise when you see fresh ingredients respected for its purity and prepared just to enhance the flavours. In essence, all 5 of us agree it was certainly an unbelievable experience and very well worth the money we paid. Also, we now view food very differently and it leaves us wanting much more."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Perfect. Sublime. Gastronomic experience,50,29 August 2014,"It was a perfect night just what you would expect from Tetsuya. Yes you do need to take a morgage out to dine here but it was worth it! There was no pretentiousness at all, it felt intimate as there was only 7 of us at the table and didn't see the other guests, we had a chef all to ourselves and we had at least two wait staff. The sommelier was wonderful he made the night for us, his choices were divine especially the Pinot wine. He was so accommodation to my daughter (she's 8yo) and even picked matching drinks for her, at the end of the evening he gave us a private tour of the wine room. We also got yo go in the kitchen and have a peek which was awesome. The highlight of the night was of course the food it was so fresh and cooked just right respecting the produce. Everything was melt in your mouth delicious, perfect balance in taste. It really was a gastronomic experience. A must for any foodie. I don't understand how this could be number 50 in the worlds best restaurant list below Attica which I went to the week before (read my review). Unlike Attica the theatre was in the cooking & produce. This is what you would expect from a top restaurant and they definitely delivered. A memorable experience. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sublime beyond all expectations,50,24 August 2014,"The food here is beyond anything I've experienced anywhere in the world, and yes, I've eaten a lot of places! It brings a new meaning to 'fresh' with the base flavours of the main components standing tall, but perfectly complimented by subtle, beautiful flavourings. The sea urchin is incredible. The beef tastes like you could cut it with a spoon. I am dreaming still about the chocolate truffles we finished with. The matched wines and sake were excellent, although the wines were very familiar ones for us as Australians. Unlike the previous reviewer who didn't like the 'hibachi' style seating, we were ok with that because it is still intimate and serious service. There is no Benihana style theatrics in preparation or service. When I expressed interest in the grill (which is actually a very clever induction plate not a Benihana style grill) the chef explained how it all worked and, because I was interested, took me out the back and showed me around the kitchen. Service was unobtrusive and perfectly timed. Yes, we moved to the lounge for dessert, but then lingered over some very excellent Pedro Ximinez while admiring the view, which was a lovely way to finish."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive and Overrated - Benihana on Steroids,30,8 August 2014,"Well.... for the 7th best restaurant in the world, it was a disappointment. The service was amazing and at the same time lacking. You sit at a high hibachi table identical to Benihana. Only 3 courses are prepared in front of you, the other 7 or 8 are served from the kitchen. Your seafood is presented to you at the beginning of the meal and some still alive, which is fine.After the presentation it was hard to talk across all 5 us laterally. If were less than 5 then another 2 people would have been seated with us and would have had to join the family conversation.After dinner you are moved to the back room for desert, which is actually to open the table for the next sitting. For the price paid $400 per person plus 7% Marina Bay Sands service charge plus GST plus 10% tip plus drinks or wine it becomes a truly large bill. The Wagyu Beef and Lobster Braised was excellent, the other courses were ok but not a wow.It just comes across as a Las Vegas style, very expensive hotel restaurant. I would not go back and would recommend other Singapore eateries especially for what they charge and what you get for that price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely wonderful,50,7 August 2014,"This is a outraged gastronomy dinner... If you can afford it, don't miss it... Every dish is pure enjoyment and I am grateful to be invited to not one..but twice.... Both out doing one another."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best meal ever,50,30 July 2014,"Absolutely the best restaurant that I have ever been to in my life. The freshest ingredients, impeccable service, and friendly staff. The uni with caviar is my favourite. Just melts in your mouth. Over the past year, I have found myself dreaming of the food at Waku Ghin since our first visit, and had to come back again and again for a quick fix. Thank you Waku Ghin, every penny spent here is well worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Nice, but so expensive",30,15 July 2014,"I like to taste many bites for different flavor experiences. The chef knows what he's doing undoubtedly. The problem is that when we got out of the restaurant we weren't only hungry but disappointed...we paid 1.600 $, and we didn't think it was amazing...they charged a bit than 11$ for very very small coffee, considering what we were already paying. The staff attention is good, flavor is good, but I honestly don't think that the price is right. I like the fact that we had the opportunity to go, but wouldn't repeat it. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Like the restaurant at the end of the universe..,50,6 July 2014,".. the Lobster waved before heading to its culinary execution. Proving how fresh the food was. At the start chef shows you the selection of seafood that will be served. As an Omakase meal you get what is served but as in the case of my wife they check for allergies or dislikes. The food was exceptionally prepared - here is the run down of what we had:French Gillardeau Oyster with Ginger and Rice wine Vinegar.anMarinated Botan Shrimp and Sea urchin and Oscietra Caviarslow-cooked NZ John Dory with charcoal grilled aubergineTamanian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato - mmm best Abalone I've had in Singapore and from sustainable sources from TasmaniaCharcoal grilled fillet of Tasmanian grass-fed beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi mustard (beef from Cape Grim)Ohmi Wagyu from Shiga prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy (hand grated wasabi)Somen with Myoga and JunsaiGyokuro (green tea to clear palate)Desserts: musk melon, chocolate Mousse, Petit FoursI also asked for wine pairing which was an extra 250 dollars but complimented the food nicely, includes sake. The stand out dish for me was teh sea urchin - i usually don't like and Abalone - never had a fresh one before.they also kindly made the mousse into a mini birthday cake with hand written chocolate message for my lovely wife's birthday."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb,50,1 July 2014,"Words almost fail me in describing this meal. Our last meal at Waku Ghin was wonderful - hence our return visit - but in many ways this was even better. This isn't just about the fabulous food, its the whole experience; the theatre of the food being presented and cooked before your eyes, the beautiful presentation, the immaculate service and the venue. Yes it is expensive but we left feeling that it was money well spent. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than expected!,50,15 June 2014,"Having tried Tetsuya's in Sydney, I knew that Waku Ghin would be nothing short of amazing, and after dining there last night, I can say that I was truly impressed with the food, service and the whole ""chef's table"" experience. It was so much better than I expected!Every dish that was placed in front of us, was cooked beautifully and presented like a work of art. Staff were attentive, but not overcrowding and all of them had a lot of knowledge about the ingredients used in the dishes. There is no denying that the price per head is costly! But what you get is a lovely 2-3 hour meal, delicious food and an amazing dining experience that Chef Tetsuya created himself."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Tour de Force,50,14 June 2014,"This is an amazing restaurant with one of the best meals we have ever experienced. To start we did not love the location and the restaurant is quiet. We enjoyed our fellow guests but the seating is not for everyone. However, once the food starts to flow every bite is amazing. The quality and freshness is exceptional and everything is prepared for you in person so there is interaction with the chef. The beef was brilliant and the wine pairings perfect. We liked the change to the scenic windows for drinks and desserts and you get a chance to watch the laser light show. This is a culinary tour de force and though expensive we left feeling it was worth and it and very satiated. A must in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin - not that Great!,30,8 June 2014,"Was with a friend to celebrate her 40s birthday at Waku Ghin the food quality is very good, top notch and very fresh, we trully enjoyed every course of it till the end. However the Sommerlier's recommendation of each course of wine pairing is very bad taste! We told him at the start we don't want a lot of the drink but would like to taste the different pairing with each course, at the end the wine were too much and the birthday girl was feeling unwell. My feedback is ""food should make you feel good likewise for drink too"" you want to enjoy it and not feel sick after a meal. His comment was the drink amount is standardized, if it's it should be McD that is standardized ... for the price we have paid I expect customization. I enjoyed my last year experience with the Sommerlier at Andre he was personalized!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Miles away and miles in front of his Sydney restaurant,40,26 May 2014,"The product that Tetsyua uses in this restaurant is quite amazing, the dishes are simple, yet they still seem to change on the 3 visits we have had. His Sydney restaurant over the years has become dull and boring, though this is where you can feel a new sense of energy in the dining private communal rooms. Everything was faultless, the abalone and wagyu courses were divine!. Only qualms I could have were the service staff seemed a little lost for such an establishment."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very Expensive,50,24 May 2014,A beautiful meal prepared in an exceptional way. Everything was so fresh and of the best quality. The deserts were beautiful as we'll. Only problem was the price $1570 Singapore dollars was far too much for a single meal.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A long long way to go for dinner.,30,17 May 2014,"Restaurant Waku Ghin , Number 7 on the list of Asia`s best restaurants , Number 50 in the World 2014 and the Singapore base of Japanese chef Tetsuya Wakuda, a bit of a shining star of Japanese cuisine and media. The only reason I went to Singapore was to eat here so i was expecting big things and to be honest the `Meal of a lifetime`.The restaurant is situated within Singapore`s Marina Bay Sands hotel which nowadays is the country`s most identifiable landmark…..think of Singapore and you immediately connect with the triple towers and the swimming pool table top. The cost of this complex was “8 Billion” Singapore dollars. The restaurant itself is a bit of a strange place to get to so allow plenty of time if you`re going. Its on the first floor above the huge casino. I tried to get in via the casino but was politely turned away as i didn`t have my passport. I was sent through the exclusive shopping mall , up a lift and onto a totally deserted floor where i had to scout around before spotting the Waku Ghin restaurant sign.When i arrived i was the only diner in the restaurant. It got a little busier throughout the evening but generally i found the atmoshpere to be a bit awkward. No music…only silence. Waku Ghin ( Spring forth and Arise / Silver ) interior is split into various small rooms, each containing a set of seats and a counter housing an immaculate griddle. The restaurant where i was dining only had 5 counter seats so that was 5 of us dining on the early sitting. The other two couples arrived shortly after i had been seated , both couples arrived and sat in silence.It was bloody awkward to say the least .I chose not to drink wine as the prices were bordering on plain silly so i went for a cold Tiger Beer at $16 (£7.60) and a bottle of mineral water at $20 (£9.50) Justify that if you can.I left the restaurant feeling as though i`d just been kicked squarely in my Gonads . I very rarely whinge about a meal as you`ll see from my many blog posts but on this occasion i felt very differently. My Bill came in at $ 513 dollars ( £244 ) with no wine. The Tasmanian Beef course was omitted from the menu.The Abalone was “portion controlled”. The fine flavoured Wagyu was overpowered by the fresh Wasabi.The signature Cheesecake never appeared and i was served a “slice of Melon”…….We live and learn. I had a relaxing stroll around the stunning Marina Bay , took aboard a few thoughts on my life and then went and spent $2 dollars on an amazing bowl of Chicken noodle soup and a stir fry in Chinatown……finally , the food hit the mark."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Yum Yum for Freshness,50,3 May 2014,"I don't like its location, walking past the Casino to get to the restaurant didn't do that much for me, casinos aren't my thing. The restaurant is designed so that you get to sit at a counter in one of about half dozen rooms that seats probably up to about 12 people, which is nice and intimate, watching the food being cooked in front of you, I love that. Food was presented to you in its unprepared state and you were told about its origin. Each dish once cooked and served came with a full explanation of the ingredients. The freshness of the food was outstanding. Each dish was presented in such away that your taste buds were screaming out Yum Yum. For dessert you were escorted to a table that overlooked the city which was gorgeous and got to see an amazing light show, very spectacular. I loved every dish that was served to me, flavours were amazing, especially the Ohmi Wagyu, that was just delicious. You are definitely paying for the incredibly fresh ingredients, but the wine was way too expensive, over the top. Would I go back......maybe, maybe not. Service was excellent, but I would expect nothing less for the price. For similar price I personally would always return to the Tippling Club though. That's my favourite."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fabulous experience, delicious food",50,22 April 2014,"This is certainly an expensive dinner, so be prepared... but if you can afford to splurge, then don't hesitate! It is a different experience than what you might expect from most restaurants. You are seated at a bar with each course being prepared in front of you. The food speaks for itself - Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar, Tasmanian Abalone with Aonori, Braised Canadian Lobster with Couscous and Tajine Spice - are a few examples and are all delicious. The Wagyu Beef course was seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted. The staff is friendly and attentive. When it comes time for desert, you are moved to a table in a different room where you are able to enjoy a nice view as you complete your meal. Do it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",best restaurant in Singapore,50,15 April 2014,Awesome food and excellent service. Each course was amazing and spectacular. Much better than Tetsuya at Sydney. The chef himself was very friendly and it was a truly wonderful meal.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Japanese food,50,28 March 2014,"If you are looking for delicious food - waku ghin is the one! I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fabulous Meal,50,20 March 2014,"We went along on a Saturday night when staying in Singapore for the weekend.What a wonderful experience. We've been to Tetsuya's years ago and loved it. This is certainly different.You are seated in a small room at a tepanyaki bar and you have dinner with 4 others. We were forewarned about this possibility. We had a lovely couple next to us who were also celebrating a birthday. The couple on the end seemed nice enough but were a little loud and intrusive, but generally were fine.We did the set menu with the wine pairing. Staff were attentive and asked about allegies and dislikes ahead of time. FOODFabulous! It was beautifully prepared and presented. They rely on the freshness and quality of their ingredients to make the dish. And what quality they are.I actually enjoyed Abalone for the first time. We both enjoyed every dish served.WINEThe wine pairing was very good and complimented the foods brilliantly. I'm not a sake drinker so they substituted any sake pairing with a wine.STAFFFriendly, attentive and professional. Sometimes almost too efficient with the taking plates away and putting new things in front of you but it's a minor thing.DECORLiked it. It's dark but not cold. The smaller room idea is a good one. PRICEIt is expensive. It was somewhere we went as a treat. It is not somewhere you plan to go for the sake of it. Saying that though, we thought it was worth it and would do it again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Indugle in the Best,50,4 March 2014,"It was for a very special dinner celebration and we have decided to choose a very restaurant to indulge and Waku Gin was our first choice and the right choice ! This is one of those spectacular restaurant that is special from the decor to the food , the service and the presentation of each dish, every aspect was perfection. As it was our first visit, we got the manager to recommend a menu for us and each dish was well recommended as they were sublime and each of these dishes went so well with the next one. The presentation of the dishes was creative, the flavours were beautiful and the ingredients were special, fresh and of top quality. Yes, it was indulgence in every sense and $$$ but it was totally worth it ! We look forward to our next visit here again. Great experience !"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A great choice in Singapore,50,27 February 2014,"We went there with my husband 2 days ago and had a great experience. The food is high quality, the service is fautless, and the whole diner was really tasty.Of course this is an expensive restaurant and for a french person like me the air conditionner is way too high ( I will suggest people who are not used to air conditionner to bring a jacket or you'll be freezing). But the overall experience was really great. The beef was so tasty and tender, the abalon was great too and we were not deceived ( as it is often the case after a good meal) by the desserts that were a perfect ending to this great evening.The sommelier is french, and gave us good advice for the choice of the Sake ( they have such a great choice of Sake in this restaurant).We really enjoyed our diner at Waku Ghun and for sure we will come back."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant,50,29 January 2014,"We have eaten at tetsuyas in Sydney a few times and haven't really thought it was phenomenal, but I can honestly say that Waku Ghin was fantastic. Yes it is expensive and yes there is not that much food, but my oh my it is clever and inventive and tasty. Sitting at a table watching a chef prepare the food was magical as he explained where the produce came from and why different ingredients were used. It's what we thought momofuku would be and wasn't. Brilliant seafood and excellent service. Definitely highly recommended by us! Domo arigato Suzuki san."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",It is THE best restaurant I've ever been to.,50,28 January 2014,"The like 15 course menu was absolutely delicious, in a private room with our own chef. He was enjoying our company because my hubby and I like tasting new things all the time. Everything was exquisite! Very pricey, but so worth it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb japanese at astronomical prices,50,8 January 2014,"If you happen to be in Singapore, and you happen to gamble, and you happen to win BIG, then go to Waku Ghin! Upon entry you are guided to a small room with bar stools and a teppanyaki grill, seated down and introduced to the chefs (if you're friendly then you'll also meet the three or four other diners in the room). After asking about allergies and dietary requirements, the chef will then display the nights offerings (most of which are likely to jump at you). The most memorable dish for me was the abalone. It was cooked to perfection, and required no sides - this is surprising considering my hatred for abalone!The only disappointment was the Uni (the only other food that i have never enjoyed). Having said that, this was the best that i've had so far - outside of japan, and the combination of flavours with the saltiness of the caviar was excellent. I would definately recommend this restaurant. An added bonus was that our chef was extremely amusing and very charismatic, only adding to the experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Extraordinarily expensive, but extraordinarily good",50,8 December 2013,"I've had the good fortune to dine at Urazawa and Masa and view Waku Ghin as in that elite company. Of course it's excellent and fresh, what elevates a place (for me at least) is the uniqueness of flavor profiles, combinations and presentations. This place has them. You look forward to each new course and are often wowed. I wouldn't pay to do any of these places twice, but I don't regret splurging on this once."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",I had a great dinner at this restaurant.,40,23 November 2013,"After reading reviews on TA, we decided to have dinner at Waku Ghin. I was impressed by seafood of this restaurant. Ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Dishes were cooked excellent and beautiful presented. Price was reasonable. Staff was professional. These things made this place have a luxurious and romantic ambiance. I had a great dinner at here. Highly recommend. I will get back if I have a chance to visit Singapore again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional Quality,50,14 November 2013,"Anytime you are looking for guaranteed high quality and delicious food - count Waku Ghin among your options. I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great sea food!,50,10 October 2013,"All of their seafood was so delicious, very fresh. Especially their signature Sea urchin: it looked tough outside with all those spikes, but inside, it was sweet and tender. The service, for sure, was great. The view at night was amazing too."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Surprised Indulgence!,40,5 October 2013,"Tucked at the 2nd floor just above the smoke-filled Marina Bay Sands Casino the discreet door led us to this exquisite fine dining of modern European-Japanese cuisine. As guests of a surprised birthday gift specially planned by a very thoughtful hubby for his wife with some of her good old friends, we savoured the signature marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar, and Wagyu with Wasabi and Citrus Soy, the superb birthday chocolate mousse cake and lobster in the 10-course degustation menu. They are very good with a very deep pocket! Go all the way with a special room overlooking Marina Bay for a spectacular view of the daily 8 and 10 pm laser shows! Memorable indulgence with good friends! Thanks for a lovely evening!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Use here for important date or business dinner. Successful.,50,25 September 2013,"You will definitely falling love with the food and ambience. Excellent service, perfect foods and wine. Timing of serving food is also great. I have nothing to complain.If you go there for business dinner with your client, you will definitely close the deal.If you go for dating, she will be impressed by you. They will serve you only course menu like 9 courses. Beautiful presentation.What you pay is what you get. Be prepared for the bill."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent food - once in a lifetime must try!,40,23 August 2013,I celebrated my special surprise birthday dinner here with my husband back in May 2011. The fusion Japanese fine dining restaurant has a very nice view of Marina Bay at night and a romantic ambience! The food was delicious and unforgettable although it took him at least 3 months in advance to book the table!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can be better,30,13 August 2013,"Family of 3 went in February 2013 for dinner. Maybe I came here with too much expectation. I was not impressed, atmosphere was stiff and the service is not that great with exception of the chef who prepared the food in your presence and one or 2 of the waiters. Unlike some other restaurant of the same calibre or price range it lacks the wow factor. Moreover there was not much privacy, people are watching you all the time. Chairs are also not too comfortable. Food was just average. Will only go back if someone else is willing to give me a treat which I think is not quite possible except my hubby."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic food . Outstanding service,50,22 July 2013,This Restaurent is a must if you like to be adventures with your food. You cannot complain it is expensive cause it is worth every penny that you are charged !! My 13 year old loved the sea urchin signature dish and ordered it twice !! Long live Tatsuya and all his great staff 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really Remarkable - but very expensive,50,16 July 2013,"Having enjoyed Tetsuya in Sydney - we were very pleased to find Waku Ghin in Singapore. Although still a restaurant run by the same chef/owner, the overall experience was completely different. While we knew it was going to be expensive, especially with the matched wine course - we were very surprised when the bill arrived. We do not research the prices before picking a place - because we may financially talk ourselves out of a great experience. This was a very good experience, but the 1600USD for dinner for two with wine felt a little more than over the top. Each course was extraordinary, building flavors and textures at each pass. The chef we had was very engaging - but not overly involved in our experience - which i appreciated. We also did not engage in any way with the couple in our room. In hindsight, knowing what we paid - I am happy not to have shared the night with strangers - maybe I am anti-social - but this is truely a once in a very long while type of experience. I am surprised to read that the menu does not change much - our chef indicated that Tetsuya is in residence at least once a month for several days. If I were to repeat the meal and have the same meal - I would be very disappointed. The signature dishes (Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato) were incredible, as was the shaved kobe beef. Our timing was very good - as we were able to watch the early 9pm(ish) light show at MBS. I was surprised to be charged 10SIN for an expresso at the end - felt like being nickeled after spending 1.6 thousand...... I would not repeat - but would recommend to friends for a very special experience. There are many Michelin-star restaurants that are equal or better for much better value. I will though always return to Tetsuya in SYD - each and every trip."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Surprisingly Asian,50,11 July 2013,"The restaurant is very expensive, at the first glance. But when you try the food you understand that it's really worth visiting and trying. Traditional courses but all with some special flavor. Direct contact with chef and observation over the cooking process makes it very intimate. If I visit Singapore, I ll have second try."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good food but expensive,30,29 June 2013,Its a great restaurant however its pretty damn pricey! The uni and caviar dish was amazing but then again how do you go wrong with uni and caviar? I dont think it was worth the money but im glad i went to check it out anyways.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Add a touch of personalized service and creativity please,40,27 June 2013,"At $500 (USD$400) for a 10 course degustation menu, the entire experience is expected to be comfortable and unforgettable. The relative high quality with the high price is a given. Therefore I am sorry that I was not that impressed with the dishes compared to other Michelin-star restaurants I have visited around the world. I wish that after repeating the same menu for almost three years there could be some innovations in presentation, some seasonalities of ingredients and some surprises in taste. And perhaps a more permanent chef since it is not realistic to expect the present of Mr Tetsuya. While I still enjoy the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato, I have also discovered many attractive alternatives that offer equally great good outside the prestigious casino with genuine warm service. However, Waku Ghin is still a place to impress someone, given all the publicities the establishment had received."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great for biz and first date to impress.,50,28 May 2013,"My 2nd time here. The service is top notch. The service staff are ever attentive. The quality of food is at its finest and freshest. Brought my partner for a date and order a bottle of champagne, bill came up to SGD$1224, 10 course meal. Book in advance and u are expected to leave ur credit card details to them via a fax or email. With the understanding if u fail to cancel the reservation 1-2 days advance, $400++ per head will be deducted off ur card."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant WorldWide for me for the time being ...,50,28 May 2013,"Of course I didn't try all restaurants, but I tried many! And I don't give many feedback... This is slightly overpriced, with the wine it is around 700 SGD per person, but the 6 or 8 times I had dinner was an excpetional experience!Their flagship dish is so expetionaly good that I made it my profile picture!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great Chef. Great Food.,50,9 May 2013,"We were there to celebrated our 10th anniversary and the chef was very nice in giving us a specially made cake for the occasion. The food, though tiny in portion, was big in gastronomic experience! Love everything they served. Can't wait to go there again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience,50,8 May 2013,"Be prepared for a gastronomic feast. What a lovely evening we had there. The food was stunning, the staff outstanding and the attention to detail in the ambience of the place made the whole evening memorable. The chef's signature dishes were amazing. I was the only vegetarian person in the group and that certainly did not cause any issues at all and the soup of avocado with potato ice cream and tonburi at the start sent me to heaven straight away! Make sure you book as that is the only way you can guarantee a table."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fantastic teppanyaki-omakase dining, the best in Singapore.",50,13 April 2013,"We ate at Waku Ghin in early April - my wife, 10yo daughter and I. Enough has been said here about the nature of the food already - it's exquisite, and the local, Tetsuya-trained chef at your table will not disappoint. All courses will be memorable, but for me the grilled Tasmanian abalone was just divine. They were great with our daughter, and she shaved the wasabi for the table with the chef who was warm, attentive and personable in a way that we've rarely seen here. There are staff aplenty quietly swarming behind you to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and the service is of a very high standard. At the end of the meal, you're escorted into the dessert room, an elevated, large glass-windowed space of tables from which you view the light show at the Marina (a little reminiscent of Quay in Sydney). By this stage, I was only able to manage coffee and petit fours, having been wonderfully and cheerfully fed some of the world's best food. Expensive, but I'd happily recommend this as easily the best possible restaurant experience in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","""Very Posh Nosh"" at an Exceptional Restaurant",50,11 April 2013,"A fabulous experience, one not to be missed. Tetsuya's Singapore restaurant is amazing, the service is perfect, your meal is prepared by your own private chef on a high tech teppanyaki grill, and the food is absolutely amazing. 10 courses which were the perfect size so not overly full at the end of the meal. Sea Urchin, Wagyu Beef, Lobster, and more, just fabulous. After dinner, coffee taken in a lounge area, along with dessert wine and Petit Fours overlooking Marina Bay and the last laser light show of the night. An exceptional evening, with a price tag to match."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special dining experience,50,9 April 2013,"Eating at Waku Ghin was truly a memorable evening for me and my wife. Firstly, this was a meal to celebrate our marriage just a few days ago. Also Tetsuya is my culinary idol (unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to meet him as he has never been at his restaurants each time I have dined) and we were going to Singapore as a stopover on our honeymoon, so Waku Ghin was a perfect excuse to splurge on a mind blowing meal.The service here is top notch, you get your own private chef, and the food is absolutely amazing (as the restaurant sources only the finest ingredients in the world). Truly one of the best meals I have ever had! For detailed review of Waku Ghin, please see the following link:http://foodmab.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/waku-ghin-singapore-15-june-2011.html"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Cannot be better,50,7 April 2013,"Hard to understand the some mixed assessments of this extraordinary place. WakuGhin really deserves to be among the highest evaluted gastronomique places in the world. Five minutes in walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands, take the way thru the gallery of the casino (impressive), you enter a world which first reminds you on a simple teppanyaki grill. To a certain extent it has similarities, but what and how the food is prepared and presented is a class on its own. You must choose the menu, which is worth every cent, starting with unforgettable Gillardeau oysters, a Sea urchin, which cannot be better in Sicily, a fillet of Tasmanian Grass-Feed Beef, which for us won against the Wagyu and, and ..... Just order and let surprise yourselves, you won't forget the evening. And talk to the sommelier or to the well experienced service staff. If you like Pinots ask for what is not on the wine list. We had the recommended Ontago Burn Cottage, a dream to this menu, so the second bottle was a must."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",very good but also very expensive,40,3 April 2013,"Like many fine dining places in Singapore, the fitout is top notch, the service is faultless and the quality of food is usually very good. all these qualities were evident when dining at Waku Ghin. the food was delicious and very theatrical watching them prepare it all on the hot plate in front of you. the produce is fresh and the uni dish is amazing. however, there is a big price tag that comes with it. having dined at Tetsuya's in Sydney, i think it is a lot better value for money and i left feeling very full. i was not fully satisfied when leaving Waku Ghin. albeit a very different style menu at Tetsuya's compared to Waku Ghin, i prefer his original restaurant in Sydney."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",It's all about the ingredients,40,30 March 2013,"This is a quite unique dining concept. You're showing into small rooms, each with its own teppanyaki-style grill and a chef assigned to you cooks the various dishes from the tasting menu in front of you. There's some exotic and expensive ingredients here but the flavours are surprisingly subtle - too subtle for my liking. Once you're through with the savoury courses, it's into the main room overlooking the CBD for the evening light show across the water and the dessert courses. It's an enjoyable experience but definitely in the special occasion basket because it's quite expensive. The individual rooms, when there's only a few people in attendance feel a little cold and strange but it's nice to be able to chat to the chef."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing,50,23 March 2013,"I walked to the restaurant through MBS and did not expect to find such a perfect restaurant in the casino. We went as the big group of 9, sake Jumnai Daiginjo was very good beyond our expectation. Great food and warm service."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hard to believe there are 62 better in Singapore~,50,23 March 2013,"I was fortunate to first eat at Testuya's establishment in Rozelle, Sydney.Along with the local chilli crab, eating here was to be one of the highlights of a five day eating jaunt with a girlfriend for our respective birthdays.She has never eaten Testuya's food, but as a chef is well versed as to his creativity and notoriety ...she was blown away !Fortunately, once inside the calming environs one easily forgets you are on the 2nd floor of a casino.The private dining room was a haven.The staff friendly, efficient.. special mention must go to our 'private chef' Kaz, also formerly of Sydney who was most engaging both about the fare we were about to consume and local tips !{ Thank you, we took your advice and went the next day for lunch ~was worth getting wet in the afternoon thunderstorm}The next few hours was hynagogic.Whether it was the enlarged 'golf ball' in my scotch tumbler, to the simple but superb crockery the evening was sublime.No need to describe the ingredients..sourced world wide.Being asked whether any allergies or dislikes is welcomed..it would be dismal to waste any of the ten courses that one is about to indulge.The combinations presented were visually enticing...and tasted even better.With an excellent wine list and some great martinis the evening was worth the flight from Melbourne.I was fortunate to explore the cellar after dinner..it was akin to a library, with bottles from every conceivable wine producing nation.Dessert with a view, the BEST(must be an Australian barista) coffee in all of Singapore and conversation with fellow guests from Venezuela and Israel, completed a food experience second to none.Is it cheap ? Of course not. If however, one is ‘in’ to food and the experience of dining like this, it is affordable gratification.Enjoy."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience...,50,18 March 2013,"The most amazing gillardeau oysters, they are the creme de la creme of the oyster world... The trout is to die for! And the seafood salad a great sashimi plate. This was just the bar menu you have to go here....!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mesmerizing Moment of Magic,50,7 March 2013,"A birthday meal befitting of a royalty. Before the meal, I was rather skeptical, thinking that Waku Ghin is going to be like all those over-rated celebrities' chef restaurants; form over substance. But Wak Ghin is nothing less than spectacular.We arrived early were seated comfortably in the classy bar area. A sweet fruity white wine was introduced to whet my appetite and I was instantly swooning in delight upon the first sip. It was thus natural to get a whole bottle, which was extremely satisfying and lasted us through the 10 course gastronomic extravaganza~The dinner started off with the friendly wait-staff guiding us to a spacious 4 dinner Teppanyaki room, whereby cheerful chefs greeted us with an impressive array of precious seafood in a wooden box. It was not long before the chef started to perform his magic through transforming these fresh foods into divine dishes that were simply irresistible. We had uni, snapper, lobster, caviar, wagyu, abalone just to name a few. And they are all insanely delectable. The dessert was refreshing and unique, something I would crave for after a while...All in the all, Waku Ghin is a gourmet's dream come true. Since life's selection of tantalizing experiences are far and few, Wak Ghin is certainly one that is not to be missed."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the most fantastic dining experience in Asia,50,20 February 2013,"Waku Ghin offers a 10-course degustation menu with a private chef to prepare each dish in front of you to delight your senses. The restaurant offers modern European-Japanese Cuisine with the finest ingredients. We have come here on many occasions and each time we have enjoyed the service and the food. The consistency in execution is to be well-commended.This time round we started the course with the Oysters, Royale with Ginger & Rice Vinegar and Gillardeau with Lemon.Followed by Waku Ghin's signature dish Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin & Oscietra Caviar. The varying textures combined with the balance of sweet, fresh & saltiness of the caviar was done to perfection. This dish makes me want to dine here again & again.We were then served the John Dory from New Zealand with Roasted Eggplant. This fish was slow cooked in a pan rather than a water bath to keep the fish's freshness. It was moist but still can smell a hint of Smokiness.The steamed Alaskan King Crab with Lemon Scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil was perfectly done. The Alaskan King Crab was placed on a bed of sea salt which water was poured to steam the crab. The result was a perfectly cooked Alaskan King Crab leg which was juicy and tender.We always enjoyed the Australian Abalone with Fregola & Tomato. The basil leaves & tomato was a perfect combination with the abalone which was cooked on a hot plate. The tanginess worked so well with the freshness of the abalone.This was followed by another decadent dish of Braised Canadian Lobster with White Miso. The lobster was cooked perfectly. You wouldn’t usually match lobster with white miso but it works beautifully since the white miso brings out the sweetness of the lobster.The main event was the Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Cape Grim Beef. Cooked medium rare, this fine piece of beef is juicy, very little fat but has enormous flavours. Even by itself it is packed full of flavour and when complemented with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard it is a match made in heaven.Our Sampi Pasta dish was a special request we made. The pasta was cooked Al Dente and then covered in Scampi Oil. The Sampi Oil is made by the restaurant from grape seed oil (healthy!) and the reduction of many kilos of scampi heads and shells. It takes a lot of effort to make a very small amount and it smells and tastes Great!!!We finished the savoury dishes with our favourite tea Gyokuro served at 40C to clean the palate.The desserts at Waku Ghin have improved since we were there 1 year ago especially by bringing in the Spanish Dessert Chef from Santos. This time round our pre-dessert was Cold Soup of Strawberry with Lychee Granita & Coconut Ice-Cream. The extremely light pre-dessert was well balanced with the sourness of the strawberries, sweetness of the lychee and the coconut flavour.The Ghin Cheese Cake was light and airy. The cream consistency along with the lemon flavours was a great dessert which wasn’t too heavy.Our Finale was the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Vanilla Ice-Cream & Macadamias. The mousse was light & airy but still kept the decadent chocolate flavour.We even enjoyed the Petit Fours especially the Matcha Truffle & the Chocolate with Mandarin Cream. Spending SGD 400 per person is quite pricey but all worth it!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Worth every cent (all 120,000 of them!)",50,16 February 2013,"Despite its setting above a casino, Waku Ghin is one of the finest dining experiences I've had, ever, period: Ambiance. Service. Cuisine. On arrival, we saddled up to the bar for a quick drink. In response to my girlfriend's request for ""something fruity and sweet,"" the bartender thought for a brief moment before whipping up a delicious blended-blueberry something. There was alcohol in it, to be sure. But we couldn't tell what it was. A perfect drink.Dinner was prepared before us, teppanyaki style, by a single chef who tended to us for the duration of the meal. He was charming and engaging without being overbearingly chatty. Our ten courses included the following: (I missed a few items here, to be sure, as the sake flowed on... see full menu in pic below)- yellow tail- sea urchin- ocean trout with seaweed- abalone with rocket and Fregula pasta from Sardinia - lobster with bisque and tarragon - Tasmanian grass fed tenderloin aged 90 days with rocket and wasabi mustard- New Zealand red snapper- Mont Blanc with vanilla ice creamAll of it fresh and beautifully presented, yet simple: no foam bubbles anywhere to be seen! We washed ours down with a bottle of cold sake and some sparkling water. Waku Ghin is not cheap. But the (master) chef has earned his reputation and, in this case, does not fail to deliver once again. Bring your wallet and a healthy appetite! (oh and a shawl or wrap: the Aircon is quite strong!)"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food,40,12 February 2013,"Great food for a special occasion. The chef was able to accommodate to some special diet requirements e.g. No beef, etc. Dessert was served in a lounge overlooking the bay offering a fascinating view. On exit, one gets a even more fascinating view of all the filled up gaming tables at the lower floors!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mixed feelings,30,14 January 2013,"How to rate a restaurant that serves great food which however made us sick later that night?! We went to Waku Ghin last week, the concierge of our hotel highly recommended the place and most people on Trip Advisor liked it very much, so we gave it a try. We had a great evening with really nice food; we recognized most comments previous visitors wrote on TA: too expensive but good. Things went wrong later that night when I found my husband with his head in the toilet pot. The SIN$ 1.100 dinner came back out again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Something different,50,8 January 2013,"This restaurant is something for a very special occasion. It is very expensive but the tasting menu (you cannot order anything else) is excellent. The dishes are prepared in front of you and the ingredients are shown beforehand. From abalone, via sea urchin, soups, lobster and steak - there is something for everybody. Also special requests are catered today without any issues. The dessert is then presented in a special room from where you have a view on the marina. I really enjoyed the experience but the prices are a all the way up there."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Number 39 in the World,50,8 January 2013,"This restaurant offers a dining experience which is comparable only with the best. It is the 39th Best Restaurant in the World and the experience here is world class. We have eaten at many Michellin rated restaurants in France and the UK and this restaurant by Tetsuya Wakuda more than holds it own. The meal opens with each couple having a chef working opposite in teppanyaki style, four people to a room. There the tepanyaki resemblance ends, the chef discussing each dish and presenting it with matching wines on a degustation basis. After 9 courses with matching wines, one proceeds to the open section of the restaurant to enjoy two delicious desserts followed by coffee or tea and petit fours.We were lucky enough to meet Tetsuya in the kitchen after our meal and this was really the meal of a lifetime. Try it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A such expensive but services and foods are good enough,50,4 January 2013,"First time to try this restaurant according to #39 of World best restaurant , overall impressive and good job Since arrived the restaurant , warm and polite welcome greeting that I can feel , Atmostphere very good as a fine dinning restaurant should be Chef table price truly expensive , but the quality of food material were good , nice presentation and explanation of every course they served , one private table only serve guest more than 6 ppl which privately Foods so tastely and high quality , the beverages were so expensive as well , couldn't find a cheap one , then I had to ordered almost cheapest one Sake 165 SGD (75ml)However , the overall of that night was enjoy and unforgettable"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent for that special occasion,50,2 January 2013,"The uni (sea urchin) with caviar and crab meat is out of this world. This is their signature dish. The other dishes are all similarly very good. It is slightly pricey though, at around S$500 a person without wine, that is around US$ 400 a person. But for that special occasion, birthday, anniversary, I think it is worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Truly amazing,50,23 December 2012,"From the get go it was a sublime experience.The dining experience is very much ingredient focussed. A lot of places these days lay claim to being just that.Waku Ghin however is the true mascot of that philosophy ""Ingredient Focussed"".The pairing that was recommended and organised by Mr. Francesco ""Flamboyance"" Galdeano was spot on for every course.A truly excellent experience overall.Will be back the next time I am in town.Kudos to Chef Kok who was our chef for the evening. He was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than Tetsuya in Sydney,50,11 December 2012,"Having dined at Tetsuya’s in Sydney, my husband and I had high expectations for Waku Ghin.Waku Ghin offers an exquisite 10-course degustation menu created from some of the best seasonal produce imported from Japan and Australia. We absolutely loved the Japanese and European flavours and were completely blown away by the food. To some extent, we actually prefer Waku Ghin over Tetsuya's. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some very good recommendations from their extensive wine list.Guests are seated in front of a teppanyaki bar and the food is prepared right in front of your eyes by the chef. Our favourite dish was none other than the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar which was just sensational. The ocean trout, pigeon and the wagyu beef were also superb. We're rather surprised to read the negative reviews. In our opinion, Waku Ghin is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore and the world even. Sure it's expensive but the dining experience including the food, presentation and service is unparalleled. Our only complaint is that the restaurant decor lacks imagination but then again, you're there for the food not the furniture."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very good dining experience but not up to expectations,30,2 December 2012,"The signature dish ""marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar"" is the only memorable dish in the set menu. The other dishes were excellent on the night of our visit, and used first-class ingredients (Alaskan king crab; Tasmanian abalone; lobster; Japanese, not Australian, wagyu steak; etc), but NONE was sublime, the way they should be in a restaurant of this calibre.Great efforts were undertaken to make the experience personal: one chef in charge of each small-ish tepan room; high ratio of waiters to guests; personalised menu. However, the generally excellent service was not without glitches: my companion's glass of still water was refilled with fizzy water, and they charged S$20++ per person for water! I was presented with the credit card and credit card slip of another guest!!!So, overall, an excellent dining experience. But, at US$500 per person (if you have one of the cheapest wines or sakes on the menu, and including service and taxes), it should have been more amazing."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Disappointing, overall.",30,13 November 2012,"We travelled to Singapore purely to eat here, and although it was good, it was by no means the best dining experience we have ever had, and I felt quite let down after paying the absolutely exorbitant bill. We were prepared to pay, and would not have begrudged one cent of it had it been as good as we hoped, but it simply wasn't. The service was attentive, at some times too much so - having the famously $20 glass of water topped up every time you take a sip was annoying, but for the most part the staff were faultless. I found the atmosphere quite sterile, and I couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer who found the lack of music disconcerting, when conversation lapsed, the silence was profound. And the food ... it was all good, but I simply struggle to remember anything other than the sea urchin which was stunning, and the abalone which was not! I think that says it all, sadly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Felt ripped off,20,31 October 2012,"Expensive ingredients cooked up quickly. The chef was concentrating solely on cooking coming across as robotic. During the wagyu course, another chef came in to help but ended up chatting with the chef. It is a collection of elite ingredients such as abalone and lobster prepared simply and displayed pretentiously. The room seats a group of people at the teppan counter and it was simply awkward during the many waiting minutes with no music. Disappointed that water is $20 per person and a sip during dessert left a bitter after taste. It appears that rich businessmen with money to flaunt are the clientele rather than food lovers. Nothing stood out except the price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya - you never let us down! Waku Ghin is the BEST dining experience in Singapore...,50,12 October 2012,"We enjoyed our first Tetsuya experience in his Sydney restaurant for our anniversary in December. My partner surprising me for my birthday last week with a trip to Singapore and a booking at Tetsuya's latest venture - Waku Ghin. Waku Ghin is completely unique - I understand why there are so many varying reviews.Those seeking a sublime culinary dining ""experience"" will love it... those seeking anything else will walk away disappointed.Yes, it is expensive... but the quality service and food surpasses anything you will find in a swanky French restaurant. It's simple really - if you're not willing to pay, don't make the booking!Waku Ghin offers a set degustation menu, with 3 couples (6 guests) seated around a teppanyaki bar, interacting with their own personal chef throughout the evening. It is a rare occasion for a chef to show you the food he is preparing and cooking for you, let alone telling you the secrets of how he is doing it!I find the reports of food poisoning hard to believe. The food is fresh... so fresh in some occasions it is still alive when presented to the chef in front of you. Seafood and meat from Australia is flown in every 2 - 3 days.Highlights of our meal included the signature dish - sea urchin and caviar - which was a complete taste sensation, and the Cape Grim beef - we have never, and probably will never again, enjoy steak as tender and tasty as that piece of meat.THANK YOU Tetsuya for another very special evening... you're doing Australia proud!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive,40,10 October 2012,"My husband and I had three days in Singapore and didn't want to miss Waku Ghin. We were impressed with the attentive but discreet service. Staff were friendly when we initiated conversation. The decor is stark but not too cold. All of the food was impressive. The presentation of fresh seafood in a crate before preparation was a nice touch. We requested and received a tour of the immaculate kitchen. We were lucky to enjoy a laser show over the bay while enjoying dessert. We were offered extra petite fours and couldn't resist. Don't miss the coffee. All in all a brilliant experience but I do think it's overpriced. We knew what it was going to cost before-hand so weren't surprised. The bill was $1200 for two people including a glass of champagne, one of wine, a bottle of wine and extra petite fours (don't know if this cost extra). The personalised menu to take home was a lovely touch. I would recommend this restaurant to others for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya back at his brilliant best!,50,9 October 2012,"Yes, it is very expensive (SG$400 per head), however it both met and in some cases surpassed our expectations. It has been a while since we have been to Tetsuya’s Sydney restaurant and we always found the food to be a mix of good and great dishes. At Waku Ghin we are at another level, the food is absolutely fantastic. The regional emphasis of the food here is Japanese rather that Australian. The whole experience is taken to a new level with the “private” kitchen and dining room for all courses up to desert. Your chef for the night prepares and cooks most of the courses in front of you, providing commentary on what is being prepared, where it comes from and answers any questions. Our chef was a young Malaysian from Melaka, he was happy to explain each dish as he prepared it.The signature dish, Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar was a triumph – my partner, never one to be too experimental with food is now a convert to both Sea Urchin and Oscietra.With the exception of the Abalone (a food that has never caught our imagination) we thought the whole meal was fantastic. Our dishes included Pan fried Ayu (fish) with Daikon and Fennel, Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon, Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass Beef (Cape Grimm) with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard and Japanese Ohmi Wagu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy.Green tea called Gyokuro is the final course before you move to the more relaxed desert lounge. The excellent deserts (Soup of Strawberry with Lychee and Coconut and Ghin Cheesecake) is follow by generous quantities of devine Petit Fours with tea or coffee.Given our experience on this visit, it is very likely that we will be back the next time we are in Singapore.Highly recommended for a unique, fabulous and memorable meal."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special night out,50,4 October 2012,"We had a night out at Waku Ghin on the 23rd of September 2012 for my husband's 39th birthday, We had 5 guests so we fitted around the teppinyaki style table easily. It was a bit awkward at first as there was no music and as we were all sitting next to each other, table conversation was difficult. We all soon forgot about this however when our chef came out and introduced himself. This guy was amazing, he answered all our questions (believe me, there were A LOT) all the while preparing us an array of beautiful dishes. The food was excellent, I tried a few things that I hadn't before (which is rare as we eat out a lot). The food was very different to Tetsuya's Sydney restaurant, much more Japanese in style.We were lukcy enough to get a tour of the pristine kitchen before we made our way to the ''dessert room'' for another 3 courses of desserts (one was a birthday cake surprise...) along with coffee, tea and petit fours (and in our case a beautiful bottle of dessert wine)Yes it is expensive but the attention to detail and service is worth it. The staff even cleaned and boxed up our abalone shells after the meal so we could take them home with us to Australia, nothing was too much trouble.An unforgettable experience"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dangerously expensive but unforgettable,50,28 September 2012,"Clear some space on your credit card and don't miss this on your stop in Singapore.This is a dining experience like no other, its like having a very personal fancy dinner party, in your own flashy kitchen,(if you had one;)with a world class chef.If you have been to Tetsuyas in Sydney then you must go here....We had 5 guests, which was perfect to fit in one of the smaller rooms around the teppen. We had a really cool chef with a great sense of humour who explained everything and answered all our, I'm sure, tedious questions! But this guy was AMAZING, we wanted to know everything he was doing!The 10 courses sound like a lot but the food is light, yet still multi faceted. There is no choice with food except dietary requirements, to which they are very obliging. So some things may not be what you would normally order, but it's all about the ingredient experience rather than eating for hunger.Everything is prepared with great precision and care and fastidious order and cleanliness you would expect from Japanese fine dining. These chefs take their craft very seriously. Truly something to be witnessed. The service from all staff was impeccable as it should be in a place like this.We were very lucky to be given a tour of the large kitchen, before our desert courses. It was like an immaculate surgery. Just amazing.The only weird thing about this place is there is no music. Makes you kind of feel like you are there before its opened. Would be nice for some atmosphere. A big Thankyou to the staff at Tetsuyas Waku Ghin for making a birthday celebration one to remember."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great restaurant experience in Singapore.,50,20 September 2012,My wife and I are big fans of tetsuyas in Sydney so deliberately stopped over in Singapore to experience this.The food was divine and it is a great dining experience. 10 courses over a few hours finishing with dessert in the dessert room.We will definitely go back next time ee are in Singapore.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",WOW,50,3 September 2012,4 of us were lucky enough to eat here on August 22. Amazing food / staff. We had KAZ as our chef. Great young man and very knowledgeable re the food etc. If l could afford to eat here once a month l would. One off experience.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive as advertised but well worth the visit,50,3 September 2012,"Access was tricky, lifts behind Hermes. We had our own room which served 4 and our own chef to prepare in front of us, modern teppanyaki style. The uni and cavier was exquisite, out of this world, the abalone presentation was also understanding. The fish was delicate but the three servings of beef was one too many, each was wonderful but come the 3rd sliver, the experience was waning. The food service was excellent and the chefs engaging but we had limited interaction with anyone other than those directly serving us.All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner we will remember for the food and the company. You can't enjoy this except for really special occassions, which I will look forward to again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Heavenly and fresh,40,31 August 2012,"I don't know if there is a fish market just behind this restaurant.... but all i can say is. -->>>WOW<<<--. The ingredients were super super super fresh! Did i forget to say super super super? :) I frequent very high end Japanese restaurants all over the world that serve really fresh seafood but this place presents one of the tastiest i have ever tried in my entire life. In terms of creativity.... they are just one step below Iggy's. However, with every bite/spoon i take, it leaves me wanting for more. So much that i had to ask my mom and sister in law for their serving!! Thank God, women eat too little hehe. The dinner was a 10-11 course degustation but it felt like a 5 course one sigh..... that's probably why most reviewers here rate the value 3 to 4 stars only. One of the last dishes served in this place was the A5. For those who have no clue of what it is, its a sirloin steak (actually they serve strips only since its so expensive) that's very very lean but can beat any Wagyu's softness if it had the same proportion or thickness. The interiors are also a step down from Hongkong's L'ATELIER de Joël Robuchon. However, you'll be amazed with the Teppan table. It was spotless! You'll find out how they keep it in mint condition when you go there. For those thinking of bringing a date, i suggest you eat somewhere else. The degustation here is like a tour. When we came here, we had to wait in the ""lobby"" while they were preparing the room. Once we finished with dinner, we were led to another location within the restaurant for dessert and coffee. The moving about wouldn't help if you and your special other were into a very intimate and long conversation. There's just too many interruptions especially with the teppanyaki guy/ sou chef doing his cooking. Overall, i would say this is the place to be when you want to surprise your friends or family who have the budget and have no clue of what's in here. I'd probably be willing to visit this place again if i have the money or not really that hungry. If all else fails, I'm going to McDonald's afterwards haha."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tepanyaki 2.0,50,30 August 2012,"If you like (superfresh - oysters, lobster etc all are shown to you still alive) seafood this is the place to be in Singapore! But also for supertender wagyu beef. A 10 course (set)diner without being completely stuffed, some courses come from the kitchen but most are made on the tepanyaki in your private dining room. I didn't get the course after having had beef going back to a fishsoup but that's the only negative comment i can thinking off. Desert in a seperate room with comfy chairs. A great (yet expensive) experience and should you have any cash left hit the casino one floor below but better is to top it off with a digestive and a great view over Singapore in the skybar KuDeTa - all at Marina Bay Sands. You will enjoy it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Suffered severe food poisoning; no contact from the restaurant,10,18 August 2012,"I cannot recommend enough that you STAY AWAY from this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday dinner on a Saturday night. In the early hours of the morning after, he began feeling very ill and subsequently was terribly sick for 48 hours. He had to go to the doctor on Monday as we were worried about dehydration, he could keep nothing down. I alerted the restaurant to the problem on the Sunday morning. The only contact number goes through to a central revervation system with a voicemail recording. I left a polite message advising that one of their diners last night had developed food poisoning, and they would probably like to check with both their suppliers and kitchen staff to make sure no-one else suffered. I left my contact details and asked them to call me back. I wanted to know if anyone else was sick that evening. I wasn't even especially angry: food poisoning, while extremely unfortunate, can happen at the best of establishments with seafood and human error. By afternoon I still hadn't heard back from them and I left another polite message. I assumed the line wasn't staffed on a Sunday. I also sent an email as an extra precaution. By mid-morning Monday I'd still not heard back so called again. Again got the voicemail recording, left another message. Sent another email. On Wednesday, I got an email from the restaurant offering us a free dinner. What?! We didn't want or ask for a free dinner; in fact I will never go there again. All we wanted was for someone to care enough about the guest that they had charged over $1,000 and left vomiting for 2 days, having ruined his birthday celebration, to actually call and discuss the situation and make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. I find this absolutely deplorable. To this day I can't read anything about 'celebrity chef' Tetsuya without thinking what a bad person he must be; and what a culture he must be instilling in his staff and restaurants. This review is overdue, but I wasn't reviewing for Tripadvisor at the time it happened. I still want to warn people now. It's not the fact that my husband got food poisoning, as bad as that was; it's the fact that not one person at the restaurant had the courtesy, care, respect or basic professionalism to call for more details and information to hopefully prevent it from happening to any of their other patrons. Dine their at your peril."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Tetsuya Masterpiece with wonderful staff,50,3 August 2012,"A great restaurant that is pricey but is a dining experience with wonderful friendly respectful and knowledgeable staff. We had a great meal that will be remembered for quite some time, but even better was the conversations with the sommelier and the restaurant manager. Thank you for a great evening.Our only negative is that we were told to gain access to the restaurant through the casino. This was a big mistake as you are constantly having your passport checked and the passport is a smokey smelly noisy place that is not of the quality of the restaurant"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Good, fresh quality food",30,23 July 2012,"For the price that we are paying, we are expecting more than just fresh quality food. The few memorable dish we had was the appetizer made with Uni, botan shrimps and good caviar. The combination of salty caviar brings out the sweetness of the uni and shrimps.... divine. The other was the Omi beef from Japan. It is well marbled and grilled slightly plain with a pinch of salt. The taste was sweet and has a pleasant fragrance without the need for any seasoning. The meat was very tender and the fat just melts in the mouth. This is the next best thing to Kobe beef which we can never find outside of Japan. Lastly, the sake that was recommended by the sommelier was excellent. We could not have enough of it. Food wise, it is definitely above the average sushi restaurant but in terms of creativity, is was a tad predictable. The restaurant has a very sombre ambiance and the chef is very serious and quiet. Not a place for playful banter or party unless you book the whole place. It is definitely romantic enough to bring a date to."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",is a meal at this level really only about the food?,20,19 July 2012,"I have dined at most of the San Pel 50 and was quite looking forward to an innovative experience at Waku Ghin following a glowing review from a fellow foodie, but was a little hesitant given that it was in MBS and thus created to cater to the brash crowd that frequent this destination. I will describe the 4 components that pull a restaurant together seperately. Ambience, Food, Drinks and Service (not in any order of preference)Ambience- Pleasently decorated the segregated dining experience can be a bit of a hit or miss dependent on whom you have as your dining companions. 5 people in a segregated room for 8 courses glued to a Tepan table with the chefs commentary and no music, can mean that the 3 Russian speakers constantly requring explanations about what each ingredient is from a not fully articulate staff could either be a comedy or very cruel torture. For us it was indifferent as we were focussed on not being disturbed, but I can definitely see the downside to this arrangement.Food-Great delivery of some very well cooked if not technically complicated dishes. Given the same quality of ingrediants it would not take a culinary genius to put this together.The Abalone was truly tyre like though and Michelin may well prove to ask this restaurant for some tips on the other side of there business. The beef and lobster were beautiful and the Uni with Caviar and prawns, was very clever combining. Our chef was a plesure. exert s a major let down.Drinks- The wine by the glass selection is weak and the lack of a paired menu disappointing at this level. They tried very hard to up sell and get us to order a bottle of white and red, but as I was the only drinker of the two of us this was never going to happen. I did manage 6 glasses of different wines and the Torbreck was definitely a winner (Well done David Powell again). On the whole a collection of overpriced overly marked up wines aimed at the typical crowd who would be more driven by labels then a sound sommelier who could point you in the right direction. (When I fesiously asked what part of France my desert wine was from, I received a blank look, which was strange as a Sauternes can not b fro any where else) At this level and these prices a little training will not go far a miss.Service - Poor, badly in need of additional training and completely the ultimate let down for this restaurant. The staff generally needed to probably dine in true fine dining establishments, be given lessons in eloquence and understanding of what they are supposed to be doing and then let out on the training floor. This was an unacceptable element of the meal. Lack of knowledge was evident at every turn.Overall- At USD 1000++ for 2 people this was definately poor value. You can only rest on your laurels for so long Mr. Tetsuya. If this left the San Pel List i would imagine it would close in a year."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Set expectation before going: novel open kitchen dining concept, not so good for intimate dining",40,10 July 2012,"It was a dinner for a real special occasion. For a dinner that is more than S$500 per person without wine, I had expected the dining experience to have sent my spouse and I to the stars and back. The food is undoubtedly imaginatively executed and tasted fabulous at every dish. 5 stars for food quality. We were not sure we got value for our buck though. That is very subjective matter especially if trying to compare amongst restaurants in this end of the spectrum. As for the atmosphere, we did not enjoy sitting on a high chair (uncomfortable for thighs and lower back) at a open teppanyaki table with 2 other couples throughout dinner , and the conversations are audible to everyone else at the table. Maybe we are more conservative. Maybe it was also how sound travels around a small room and across a stainless steel surface. If you are planning on having a dinner where you can also enjoy your private couple space for intimate conversations then this dining concept may not be for you. It is a matter have having the correct expectations. Overall, it was a great meal and memorable creativity, however I do not think I will come back again for a while until the dining concept is tweaked."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not as good as I thought it would be...,20,18 June 2012,"My husband and I were i Singapore for a night before heading to our final destination Australia. My father in law made a reservation for this restaurant for me and my hubby and paid upfront for the menu as a gift for us. The menu was supposed to be tasting menu accompanied with wine for each course. After reading all the great reviews about Tetsuya and how great his restaurants were and after seeing the price of 1000 $ for a 10 course menu I really was expecting something extraordinary before coming to this restaurant. I was so disappointed. We sat down and got offered a glass of water and got served our first appetizer. I immediately thought - were is the wine which was supposed to go with our menu? Their English (believe it or not) was not that good (or did they pretend not to understand?) and it took them a while to see what we asked for. They said they had to check with their colleagues whether or not the wine was ordered!!! So we ended up waiting for them for the whole 15 min with the appetizer in front of us (we didn't know whether we should start eating it or wait for the wine) so that they could check whether or not we had wine ordered. For this much money I would expect the staff to be more professional in their handling of clients. They came back after a while with yet another colleague who, again (did pretend?), did not understand what we asked them about. In the end, after the whole 20 min of back and forth they finally agreed - yes, the wine was offered with your meal when you had purchased it...Wow - no sorry, nothing! So the dinner really started off bad, we had to argue to get what we had ordered, what un unpleasant start to what was supposed to be a high quality dining!In the end, the food was ok but definitely not extraordinary for what you would expect after paying so much money. The only original dish I liked was sea urchin - their signature dish I believe. Also, the waiters were not attentive and you had to wait for them to take plates once you finish a course."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but should have been much better,30,10 June 2012,"We had dinner at Waku Ghin in June 2012. We had the standard 10-course meal together with champagne throughout the meal.The meal started well with an orange-infused tataki of katsuo and the signature appetizer with uni, raw botan ebi and oscietra caviar. Both of these dishes were very good and similar in style and taste to what you would expect at a Nobu restaurant. You cannot get food that is much better than this anywhere in the world so we were in foodie paradise at this stage and expected this to be one of the best meals of our life.Unfortunately, the meal went downhill from this excellent start. We got a very bland and forgettable pan-fried fillet of Ayu followed by an overly rubbery teppan fried abalone served with what tasted like a standard tomato and basil pasta sauce. We suspect that the abalone would have scored higher points with the tyre making division at Michelin than with the firm’s famous restaurant critics. These two dishes were not to our liking and we braced ourselves for what was to follow. Luckily the dinner took a turn for the better with teppan fried lobster and two different beef dishes. These three dishes were all good, and based on premium ingredients, but the dishes were not memorable in any way (luckily we got a copy of the menu together with the bill – otherwise we would have struggled to remember the dishes). At this point, our meal at Waku Ghin felt too much like an ordinary teppanyaki experience. The savoury part of the meal was finished off with a somewhat boring consommé of rice and snapper followed by exclusive gyokuro first-flush tea.After this we transferred from the teppan counter to the dining hall overlooking Marina Bay. We finished off the meal with two forgettable French-style inspired desserts followed by mignardises.In conclusion, this was a good meal and the Osaka-born chef was excellent. However, at this price level we expect a more consistent experience and above all we think that a majority of dishes should be memorable. Sadly this was not the case and I do not think we will return."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Most Amazing Dining Experience!!,50,28 May 2012,"Most incredible dining experience....every course was special...the sea urchin was super....as was the alaskan lobster....the teppanyaki chef was proffessional and charismatic...every course had me feeling that it was unique and flavourful and the best so far...until the next one came along!!!And just when we thought it cdnt get any better...we were ushered into the desert salon for more amazing delights....even the petit four was divine...in spite of the steep prices, I cant recommend it highly enough...I wd do it all over again in a heartbeat!!The stunning ambience and fabulous wine selection doesnt hurt either!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Singapore is a must after Tets Sydney restaurant,50,18 May 2012,"I have experienced Tet's restaurant back in the hay days when he was on the other side of the bridge in a very small funky restaurant and he was a master of degerstation menu back then. When he moved over the bridge to Sydney CBD you knew that Tetsuya was becoming famous for his dining experience. So with our trip to Singapore last year we quickly booked a spot at Waku Ghin as it is a massive wait. So book well ahead. WOW it was the most incredible experience and meal ever. 10 courses and a take home box of truffles. I do not eat meat, so I was looked after well and my partner so did enjoy his 2 meat dishes and commented best ever meat dishes. The wine list is so extensive and the cost of alcohol is not cheep at all in Singapore and it was a night we were happy just to eat and enjoy the journey. It is not a cheap night out, so do take the cheque book as much more than the Sydney restaurant. But if you are a fan of Tet's then it is a must do at Singapore. You are so well looked after and it is so personal, that no one can beat what Waku Ghin does, well not found any better as yet. The ambience is an experience also."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Perfection,50,30 March 2012,"Our visit to Waku Ghin was unplanned, and having failed to reserve tables at Tetsuya's in Sydney several time, to be able to reserve a table at such a short notice was a good start. We were led to a private cubicle and the Maitre d'hotel started asking if there was any ingredient we were not consuming that night and if we liked some drinks to start with.The restaurant feels very private and classy, but not too extravagantly luxurious. We had 10 different course of the Best French Japanese Fusion Meals. Every course was both mouth-and-eye-watering, each perfectly portioned. Scallop, Sea Urchin with oscietre caviar, Bamboo Clam, Ayu with braised withlof, Abalone with fregola,Blackmore Wagyu and Tasmanian truffles were served in order. Each course has its own distinct taste and blend and with each course, the excitement just grows. To add to the excitement, Mr. Tetsuya himself came in to greet and accompany us, he explained briefly about the motive behind his first move outside Australia. Such a great gesture from the connoisseur. Surely this was easily one of the best culinary journey we have ever experienced. We had several good drinks to accompany the perfect meals including Gyokuro, the unique Japanese green tea made from selected young green tea leaves, Masuizumi, unpasteurized Junmai Ginjo made specially for Tetsuya's, Yalumba Viognier and 2001 Torbreck Grenach. To wind up the already a wonderful dinner, we were brought to a common area overlooking the Singapore Marina Bay where fireworks happened to be in display with Singapore skyline as the backdrop. Granita of Kyoho Grapes, Cheesecakes and petit four are served as desserts. Perfect Finish.The whole experience was considerably expensive, outrageously expensive by Singapore standard some may say but well worth it if it were for a special occasion. It is still a good value otherwise in my opinion. An example of culinary perfection and I would gladly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fabled gastronomic journey."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in the World,50,17 March 2012,"The best restaurant in the world, The best wine and dining experience to go with it.Tetsuya is the maestro now he has his dream orchestra. Beautiful design with the freshest ingrediants from all over the world cooked to perfection in front of you, Bellismo. Dom Perignon to go with the Cold asparagus and Oscietre Caviar then the Marinated Botan Ebi with se urchin and Oscietre caviar.That is just the first two courses. The worlds best Wagu beef from Japan, Canadian lobster, Alaskan crab, Tasmanian abalone etc etc. with wines from all over the world Chassagne Montrechet from France, Guwetz traminer form Alsace, Shiraz from the Barossa and some exquisite Sake .All presented and prepared in your own private dining room overlooking singapore.Tets we love you xxx"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular food and spectacular view in Singapore,50,21 February 2012,"I had to email to get a reservation beforehand and the restaurant is not that easy to find. However, the meal there was spectacular and on par with the 3 Michelin starred restaurants in New York. First of all we had a private room where the chef only served us. He explained every dish thoroughly and answered any questions we had.We started with a flan of salmon row from Hokkaido served in warm soup. The roe was perfect and the flan was great. Next was the sea urchin with fresh botan ebi from Canada topped with oestra caviar. The dish was fishy, salty and tasted perfect. The shrimp tasted like they were cooked, even though they were raw, and the sweetness of the shrimp balanced the brininess of the sea urchin and caviar.Next was the New Zealand John Dory with eggplant and sumi yaki sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked as was the eggplant, and the ginger taste came through in the dish. The French foie gras with South African mango was seared and spectacular. The mango added a perfect amount of sweetness to the richness of the foie gras and this was one of best foie gras that I have ever had.The seared Tasmanian abalone with pasta and tomato sauce was cooked perfectly and was a little peppery. The tomatoes and pasta added a nice contrast to the abalone. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and arugula added bitterness to the dish. The last seafood dish was Canadian lobster that was cooked with olive oil, garlic, shallots and topped with fresh tarragon. The lobster was fresh and sweet and the broth from the olive oil, garlic, and shallots was amazing. Our next savory course was Wagyu beef with fresh grated wasabi, garlic chips and spring onion. This was the best wagyu beef I've ever tasted. The meat was cut into cubes and cooked perfectly medium rare. The fresh wasabi was mild and perfect for the meat, which melted in my mouth. The final savory course was chicken stock with Japanese snapper and rice porridge. The fish was tender, the broth was great and the rice added a nice vehicle for both the broth and the fish.We moved to another room for dessert, which was granita of Kyoto grape. The granita was very sweet and the grape was great. This was a refreshing dessert. As we ate dessert, we looked over the harbor and across Singapore. The view was amazing as was the food."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sublime,50,18 February 2012,The best dining experience in Singapore. Exquisite ingredients and presentation and fabulous to watch the chef cooking in front of you. Tetsuya was there as well so the experience was complete.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Utterly Brilliant,50,20 January 2012,"Dinner at Tetsuya Wakuda's venture ""Waku Ghin"" in Singapore. There are two seatings per night and the first must have been running late as there was a 10-15 minute wait at the bar.The restaurant is divided into a series of rooms each with seats at a counter and large teppan. The majority of the dishes are cooked on the teppan in front of you by a single chef through the evening. Desserts are served in a single larger room with regular tables and a view of the bay.The dish highlights were the Crushed potato with smoked eel, Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin and Oscietre Caviar, Steamed Alaskan King Crab with Yuzu scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon.Service was excellent - friendly and well informed.I would recommend it as the food is utterly brilliant, easily among my favourites from the trip, I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Was this the best meal I have ever eaten?,50,27 November 2011,"If it wasn't it was certainly in the top 5. OK it was eye wateringly expensive for Singapore ($400 Sing for food alone) but the ingredients were the best quality in the world, they were beautifully cooked and presented and in a lovely intimate environment. Frankly I would rather have one fabulous meal like that than a dozen ho hum meals. Particular standouts were the signature dish of Sea Urchin with Oscietra caviar, the Alaskan King Crab cooked on the teppan on salt and the wagyu with fresh wasabi. We did have some excellent wine to accompany the food but it seemed almost redundant because of the subtle complexity of the flavours. In a word - superb!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting experience,50,20 November 2011,"There's so much to say - where do I even start? The whole dinner was a very interesting (and positive) experience indeed.We booked a degustation (priced at S$500 per pax) for two. The hosts were impeccably polite and polished. We were led to a teppanyaki-styled dining area which seats about 6 pax. The ambience was nice and cozy, with nice marble table-tops.As it was a degustation menu, it was pretty much ""fixed"". However, the chefs were attentive and checked if there was anything which we would like to them replace (i.e some diners may not want beef due to dietary retrictions). The food was exquisite, concocted from the very best and freshest ingredients sourced the world over, e.g botan ebi, abalone, sea urchins, wagyu beef, etc. The presentation was refined and reflected a fusion of Japanese and Western cuision, which underscores the style of each dish. The best dish was the finely sliced Wagyu beef served with freshly ground Wasabi, which definitely left us wanting more!Some of the dishes on the menu were prepared in front of you, where the Chef would cook it on the teppan, to your preference and liking. While the Chef did not demonstrate knife-juggling skills as you would expect in a normal teppan restaurant, he took great care in explaining each dish and how it is best eaten. This made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.The desert was served in a separate room, overlooking Marina Bay. We were treated to an unexpected firework display over the bay, as there were some ongoing celebrations. The Ghin cheesecake, which is their signature dish, was simply yummy! In addition, you could choose up to 4 different kinds of petit fours, all of which were delightfully good. Would definitely visit again, when they have a new seasonal menu."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",even better than tetsyua sydney,50,11 September 2011,"Love, Love, Love this place. Would have to say it was the best dinning experience of my life! A magical evening of taste sensations, best wine list I have ever seen and can not wait to get back"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth it!,50,5 September 2011,I ate here 2 weeks ago and had such a good experience! They only serve a 10-course degustation menu worth SGD 400. It is pricey but definitely worth it. See my blog entry for details of what I thought about each of the 10 courses:http://goodfoodishappiness.blogspot.com/2011/08/waku-ghin-japanese-fine-dining-and.htmlShould be worth a try for special occasions and that once in a lifetime experience!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not value for money,20,11 August 2011,"We were disappointed with this restaurant as we felt it was way overpriced. The two of us shared a room with two business men which meant it wasn't intimate at all. The chef was timid and seemed to be doing his job without showing any real enthusiasm. With exception of the beef and the dessert courses, we felt the tastes were not as good as the Nadaman Japanese at the Shangri-La where we stayed (or any of the restaurants at the Shangri-La). I don't mind paying a high price for food but when I spend S$900 for 2 people (including 1 bottle + 1 glass of wine + sparkling water), I really expect to come out raving about the food. This is the second time we have tried a ""celebrity chef"" without the chef and we been disappointed so we won't make that mistake again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","do not care about money, just care about.. products and quality",50,21 June 2011,"I am going there every months or almost... been to many restaurants in Singapore and abroad ( I am an expat..) but Waku Ghin is ""very special"". The best products, individual rooms, friendly staff, so what more you could expect ? and for the one who complain about the bill... my answer, don't go ! by the way, if you go to good restaurants in Europe, it will cost you much more !"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",overpriced teppanyaki,20,14 June 2011,"this was essentially a teppanyaki restaurant and you are paying a hefty premium on top of the air freight charges for flying in all the ingredients in from abroad. there is nothing ingenious in the preparation or the taste. It's obvious that tetsuya is trying to capitalize on his fame by charging maximum amount for minimal work. I agree with other reviewers that the lobsters tasted like rubber and the steak was tough. For the price I paid, I expect every dish to be exceptional. This, unfortunately, was not the case. Other than his signature dish of ebi and sea urchin, nothing was memorable. The atmosphere is also very sterile and not to mention no privacy whatsoever as the teppanyaki chef can hear every word you say, so the venue is neither suitable for business entertaining nor a romantic night out."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Beyond Expectation,50,9 June 2011,"Excellent concept, totally diferrent to Tetsuya. The chef cook infront of you and interact with the diners. Too bad we didnt get Mr Tetsuya to cook for us =(
10 courses, matching wines is available for $150. Bit pricey compare to Tetsuya
Staff are friendly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A seriously misunderstood restaurant,50,18 May 2011,"I'm not sure what planet the previous reviewers are from, but this is a ""do not miss"" visit when in Singapore. Sure it is expensive, but if you are interested in trying the best of the best you must visit. Tetsuya Wakuda's commitment to only using the best and freshest ingredients possible (even if it means sourcing them from far away) results in an unforgettable taste experience. The light and sensitive touch in the kitchen, with a focus on not messing with quality ingredients is no doubt due to his grounding in japanese cuisine. The sea urchin with barely-cooked lobster topped by caviar is an ethereal experience that I recommend to all. The only down side is a heavily marked-up wine list with no half bottle options, but the sommelier kindly provided 3 glass pours for the price of a half bottle. The service is immaculate and friendly. If this does not get 3 Michelin stars soon, a Senate enquiry will be warranted!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE- AMAZING!!,50,7 April 2011,"I cannot believe that this restaurant has gotten so many poor reviews...i thought it was absolutely fantastic. We came to singapore for only one night after a 2 week trip in cambodia, vietnam and laos. I saw this restaurant as listed as one of the top restaurants and since my family and I are very into fine dining we decided to give this place a try and we were NOT disappointed.Yes, it is VERY expensive so i do not suggest going there if you will be upset about spending all of that money on food- do not go if have budget restraints! However, if you get past that, the dining experience is incredible. We walked into the restaurant and were seated by the charming australian sommelier . He really made our experience. He chose amazing wines for us in our wine pairing. As the other reviews said, you sit in rooms for 5 to 6 people and since my family is 5 we had one all to ourselves. The service was quite attentive and the time between meals was great. Now, for the food...i do not have my menu with us so i don't know every exact name of the dishes but here it goes: our first dish was some exotic fish that reminded me of a tuna belly or hamashi but it was fantastic...very fresh. The thing about the food here is that it is not like allinea in chicago (LOVED) or fat duck (which i didnt like)...the chefs not into molecular gastronomy. The food is just the best ingredients (Thats why they charge so much) done simply and SO well...therefore, some people can misconstrue this simplicity as a waste of money...it's very difficult to do food the way they did even though it seems very simple. The only dish i was not crazy about was the sea urchin which is their speciality. I had sea urchin at Charlie Trotters in Chicago and i liked it better there. However, the kobe was phenomenol and i don't even like crab and i loved it there. The ingredients are so fresh that the menu changes daily (even though i don't completely buy that...it's mainly the same but a few things change like the deserts). One of my favorite dishes of the night was the egg with truffles and potato...SO delicious. The portions are nice sized but theres only about 6 real dishes (i don't count the soup) and then you're moved to the other room for desert. The room has a nice view and it's a great atmosphere change. We had melons and a cheese cake and the deserts were fantastic...a lot of times these 3 Michelin type restaurants mess up the deserts but their signature cheese cake was great. They ended you off with petit fours but thats it...that's always a disappointment when they don't do anything more at the end of such a nice meal...we always look forward to what we called ""the punches""-- the extra deserts at the end that are not on the menu but here's a heads up if you're into that. We ended up with a nice desert wine and some zambuca and a large check...but from the food to the sommelier and the experience, it's worth the money if you can afford it and appreciate cooking at its best."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointing & outrageous,20,8 March 2011,"We went in there expecting good food. The attention the staff gave us was outstanding but it was too much attention. Waiting was long. The food preparation was fun to watch . We had maine lobster tasted like rubber, the kobe beef from Australia got over cooked and well done. When we finished the dinner and when we saw the outrageous amount of sgd of 2000/- we almost choked. Felt like the kobe beef was stuck in our throats. Over priced, over cooked over attentive. What a disappointment !!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely no sense of occassion,20,29 January 2011,"We dined at the restaurant in October 2010, with great expectations. Perhaps I should have taken it as an omen when there appeared to be a question on whether we had a reservation. The night duly arrived and off we set to Waku Ghin. As we were aware the restaurant is in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex..... which is partially opened and devoid of people at 8:30pm.The maitre'd is English and is rather frosty in his greeting. We were shown to the private room which is a teppan grill with seating for 7 people and there we waited and waited and waited for 30 minutes before it was suggested that we may wish to have a drink. We ordered some San Pellagrino and perused the wine list. The wine list is excellent and really show cases Australian wine. It is a shame that the pricing is ridiculous considering the GST and service charge have to be added.Finally after the chef peeking through the door several times and the other guests had arrived, the food preparation begins. There were 2 chefs preparing the food that night and it seems that the chefs do not start until the teppan grill is full which begs the questions why not synchronise the patrons to the same time instead of 3 separate groups arriving over 30 minutes?The several courses duly arrived and whilst the ingredients are the freshest available none of the courses are outstanding in fact some are outright disappointing the abalone for example is tough, the Wagu Beef is a a mere morsel. Pity the poor 15 year old dining with his parents alongside us, he must have been starving at the end of the meal.During the meal one of the waitresses decided to open the sheer curtain to improve the ambience, it was delightful the Chanel neon sign lit up the entire room! She drew the curtain very quickly.In conclusion we paid approximately $S1280.00 for this experince. Both my partner and I felt flat at the conclusion of the evening. Neither of us could believe we had spent such a large amount of money and felt nothing. We have dined in some of the best restaurants in the world and this is the only restauarant where we have experienced an evening such as this."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The El Bulli + Fat Duck of the East... A foodie experience not to be missed when in Singapore,50,17 December 2010,"This is my 4th visit and everytime I have come here, the experience has been a tour-de-force for the palette, never once disappointing - standards still kept high. If you've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney's, this place ratches the ""wow"" at least 5 notches. Be forewarned that reservatiions here are difficult to come by - with at least a week or two prior recommended. The experience however doesn't start off too well as the lobby area before you get to the food looks strangely like a souless airport lounge with an empty bar area. Ushered quickly to one of the 3 or 4 private rooms, the show begins as you sit down in front of a large teppan grill and the chefs present the fresh food of the day. This is really the soul of Waku Ghin - the fresh ingredients. Unlike fat duck or el bulli - there is no magic molecular gastronomy - it is just simply the best of the freshest ingredients from Australia or Japan that money can buy - combined in the most delightfully simple of ways - executed to a science, but performed as an art in front of you... the loving way the chefs prepare each dish in front of your eyes is a visual treat in itself - not to be missed. A cautionary note here that with the freshest and best ingredients - comes a very hefty price tag with a wine paired 6 course dinner setting you back about $700 per person. Without the wine is $400.On to the food - WG's signature dish: Uni with bontan shrimp and cavier - does not disappoint. It is always consistently amazing. My other favorite is by special request only so try to ask for this : a lightly charcoal grilled tuna belly - with charcoal from Japan giving the tuna belly a wonderful just slighly smoky aroma and taste. Served with the tinest portions of grated ginger and fresh wasabi - it is an amazing palette kicker.The other courses are good - but the first two I mentioned are truly outstanding.The abalone (somewhere towards the end) - though visually stunning whilst cooking - is not to my liking as it come out a tad too rubbery and flavors clash. I would suggest you ask to replace this if you are not a fan of abalone anyway.The Kagoshima beef (Grade 5) at the very end served 2 ways - completes the experience with just the right amount of meat. Slowcooked for the last 30 minutes - it melts in your mouth.. paired with garlic chips (fr Japan) - to die for! Lastly, the palette cleansing tea at the end - is very refreshing and tastes very much like a seaweed broth and clearly some of the finest tea leaves used.Desserts are OK - so if you are already full and choose to skip - you won't be missing out."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori dinner,20,16 October 2018,"Unfortunately we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive for every order we made, and halfway through, the wifi broke, so no one could order through the automated system. They could not cook fast enough for a full house."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious and Fresh Salmon Sashimi,40,15 October 2018,"Went there and had the dinner buffet. The spread of items were quite extensive from sashimi to grill to some dishes.I enjoyed the salmon sashimi, pumpkin chawamushi and garlic fried rice the most.I found the pumpkin chawamushi very interesting which felt like a fusion of Western and Japanese cuisine.Service was good but could have been better. Some of the serving staff seemed new and inexperienced.My partner and I managed to order and finish 41 plates/bowls."

Food are fresh but BBQ items are mostly too overcooked when served, in the end a bit hard to bite on. I'm not sure if there's too much msg added but after the lunch we drank a lot of water for the whole day."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner ,40,6 October 2018,Decided to try this much heard about ala carte buffet for my birthday dinner. Food is above average with lots of choices from the menu. From sashimi to sushi to tempura to yakitori and many others. Sashimi was fresh and portion is served accordingly to the number of people. But service was a bit slow and orders left out towards the end thus it took a long time but was rectified after the supervisor was informed. Overall it’s definitely worth a visit but perhaps not on a weekend where the restaurant is really packed. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic ala carte buffet,50,3 October 2018,I came here for their 1-for-1 ala carte buffet by Chope.The sashimi was very fresh. The other dishes they served were tasty too. The served each dish we ordered in small portion so that we can eat more variety of food in the menu. I like!My husband and I kept coming back for this promotion because it is value for money and we get to eat our favorite Japanese food at a fraction of what we usually pay in other Japanese restaurant! Very good deal!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The people who work there did not seem to like their work.,20,2 October 2018,"I have been to Shin Minori since 2015. Usually for my birthdays. Or my Father's birthday. The service that was given today (Our dinner timing was 29 September at 7.30pm) compared to the first time we went, it really declined. I also saw that the table beside me on the corner, were complaining that they never got their food. That day there were 6 of us in a group. Our food was also quite slow but it was just how the people served it or approached us, it was cold and just seems like they do not like working there. Sashimi was not as fresh as the last few times I was there. Friends who were there for the first time did compliment that the BBQ / Grilled food were good. I am happy though that the menu still had Sword Fish because that is the only reason that I chose Shin Minori over other sushi place everytime. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth Ala-Carte buffet,40,2 October 2018,The Ala carte buffet price is worth and the quality is up to the standard. The sashimi are fresh and the grill meats have more varieties.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",service needs to be better,30,27 September 2018,Lack of service and food quality is not very good. orders take very long to come as well. waiting staff are not attentive at all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is okay, service quite slow, place is spacious",30,24 September 2018,"Menu to order was a little confusing at first. Each order you send is literally ""one piece"" - so make sure to order in larger quantities. (All the ""one piece"" orders came much later than the ""larger quantities"" orders.)Sashimi is usually served faster than the yakimono. Sashimi had thick cuts; pretty acceptable. Sushi had lots of rice (not my personal preference). Chawanmushi in different flavours was slightly disappointing - it was the default chawanmushi with sauce/topping on top.Atmosphere was still decent. Place could cater to big groups (I had a table for 8). Overall, still an okay place that is value for money, especially since it's ala carte buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",on of the best japanese a la carte buffet in Singapore,50,22 September 2018,"I was at Minori couple of times, it just can't be better for the price you are paying ,very huge and fresh selection of japanese food, reasonable prices for drinks and service was friendly and careful even they were so busy, so looking forward to be back when I pop by in Singapore again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher - Lunch Buffet,20,20 September 2018,"Went to Shin Minori (UE Square branch) due to the countless advertisements from google and videos. Checked out the price and realized that it is actually really really pricey for a buffet - could get one at the same price for 2 when this is meant for 1 pax - so obviously i was expecting to be of quality because of the value for one. The restaurant looked good and the ambiance was really good for something pretty classy, however, as what i expected was a buffet, it felt kinda weird (since everyone is used to the crowded, noisy, etc).Food has to be ordered through the ipad (which crashed couple times, lol), with not many many varieties for the buffet. and the buffet did not even have free drinks or desert for the price - was shocked as well as pretty taken aback. The food quality was pretty average, and the food serving was very slow - mostly waiting for >30 minutes per item other than the sashimi (cause it should be premade). There was quite many items which was ordered but not served as well. The people who were working at the branch i was in was not very enthusiastic and was not eager to help at all, all of them had a really unhappy look on their face and i naturally did not feel very welcome as well. Just as the buffet was coming to a close, the owner(i presume) - came in and told the chefs to prepare some food (which was the same as we ordered) for a shoot (more advertisements i guess) - and sadly, the presentation of those food was of a completely different standard. Firstly, i did not expect this kind of service or food quality for something of such a high value. And this really isn't going to be compensated with the ambiance of the location. Frankly, i felt that i've wasted my money there and that i could have easily spent the money on something more worth it.This was an utter disappointment. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,40,19 September 2018,Tried the buffet on a Wednesday. Food was amazing and service was fast. They have a lot more variety thn other buffet places. Loving the grill stuffs. Overall was good.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Slow Service,40,13 September 2018,"Went there with colleagues on a weekday lunch. Plenty of parking in the building.Food was relatively good. Sashimi was excellent. Thick juicy slices. Shrimp Tempura nice too. Sushi was average. The Chopped Tuna Belly Sushi was horrible. We left them mostly untouched (and was told by staff not to waste food).Service was acceptable but very slow. We waited almost 45 minutes for some dishes. After chasing for some orders in vain, we placed other orders, thinking that the earlier orders were lost in transit. But they all arrived together at the end, forcing us to eat when we were already full. All in, we were there for close to 2 hours.We ordered the a la carte buffet at $43.90++ each. Ocha at $1.90++ not included. With Entertainer app 1 for 1 main course deal, it worked out to only $28 per person. Not a bad deal. I was told similar offers are available on Chope. Come here if you like sashimi, have an offer and 2 hours to spare. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,50,11 September 2018,Sashimi is fresh and it is one of the very few places that serve swordfish sashimi in their buffet. Food is served quickly so you don't have to worry about waiting even when it's crowded. And there is a wide variety to choose from.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",$53 National Day promo or not?...,30,2 September 2018,"Went for above promo. Ordered sake for 2 pax, orange juice for another Pax. Service staff aren’t keen to serve 2 sake bottles, despite the tiny bottle size. Therefore they prefer to waste time running to-and-fro. When we requested for 2 bottles instead of the unnecessary running about, we were told : per table having the same drinks were only entitled to 1 bottle. To the management of shin minori; does the $53 promo means it’s for per Pax or per table?Have better business etiquettes, train your staffs better , to upkeep the service standards. For the template replies of “reduce wastage” , why not , for such future promo , introduce a wastage chargesas well?You are risking negative words of mouth , and a permanent loss of re-visiting customers with such inflexible tiles.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below Average,20,17 August 2018,"On 15 Aug 18 we went to Shin Minori for a birthday celebration and choose their 53th birthday promotion. All the service staff seems clueless of this promotion and NON of them could tell us much about the promotion. The staff can’t even tell whether they are serving house pour or not for the promotion! So naturally we have no idea how the restaurant track 53mins as we were not told. One of the waitress can’t speak English and seems unhappy all the time. Why put her on the floor when she can’t even speak basic English and seems reluctant to be there? Wouldn’t she better off as a food runner or at the bar?There were 3 service staffs and a Manager on duty, the restaurant is NOT full, yet it was so difficult to get their attention for service. Service was slow, lost our orders and we constantly have to get them to refill more sake and beer. Cold Sake was served in a Tokkuri which I thought it’s more appropriate for hot sake and tiny cups. Beer was served in a small rocks glass that most restaurants in Singapore would use it for ice water. The restaurant will only serve us ONE bottle of sake for 4 persons and a beer in rocks glass. I wondered why because they could use bigger glassware and we will take a longer time for refills! It was very annoying for us because we constantly have to wave to get their attention. So I do not understand the rational of them serving drinks in this manner when their staffs have difficulty coping with refilling drinks! Or perhaps this is their ways of limiting our consumption? The staff did not inform us of the last order but simply told us that the promo has ended and we cannot order anymore Sake/beer which I think it’s really unfair. How do we know 53mins has ended? How does the restaurant track the time when they are struggling with service? I approached one of the waitress to clarify on this matter and of course she don’t have any explanation BUT we cannot order the drinks anymore. So I told her to check with the Manager and let us know since she seems unsure. She didn’t come back at all so after 20mins we approached another service staff to get their manager over. She was quite defensive and claims that her staff told us about the last order which she clearly did not. Long story short, eventually she gave us another round – reluctantly and she insisted my friend finished the beer before she serves another one. This is bad customer service! She knows we are annoyed so why aggravate the situation even more? How much will this less than half pint beer cost the restaurant?? Seriously if the restaurant can’t run this promotion properly and thinking of cutting corners, please don’t do it because it is bad for the restaurant and reputation. Our bill came up to $311.90 which is not worthwhile for the entire experience at all. We’ve decided on Shin Minori as most of us had good experience previously and food was good. I can’t say the same for last night, other than the Sashimi the rest of the food were pretty average and nothing great about it. Suffice to say this will be the last time we will be dining at Shin Minori because there are better and nicer Japanese restaurant around UE Square!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An okay dining experience,30,14 August 2018,"The restaurant was easy to find while the ambiance was rather dated and tired. Staff was attention quick to clear dishes and refresh drinks. The sashimi was fresh and good, so was the maki and yakitori sticks in general. However some of the main dishes were very average and did not inspire us to even finish some of the dishes. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is so so but very slow in serving, lost our orders several times",10,13 August 2018,Very hard for us to visit this place another time because our multiple orders at repeated times were lost.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi,50,10 August 2018,The sashimi is fresh and juicy. We went for the 1-for-1 ala carte buffet only available through The Entertainer app. Value for money. I intend to bring my family there. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic sashimi,20,8 August 2018,Sashimi was very fresh and great. Overall food was good. Lunch crowd. We waited an hour for food from kitchen.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lousy service,10,5 August 2018,"Staff failed to explain the 53th birthday promotion properly, thus shortchanging my dinner party of drink ! When asked politely of them to just fill us up for the last time since miscommunicated, still insisted to stick to the time limit when they were the ones who never made sure we knew of our time limit ! Please train ur wait staff properly . Food wise, nothing to wow about . With the $63/pax price tag ,i could find better food better service elsewhere ."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Lunch,30,5 August 2018,Food comes in small quantities which was good so that you can try more varieties. However certain items with sauces were too savoury especially the teppanyakis
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but average for the rest,30,29 July 2018,"Food is ordered by tablet, seems to have inconsistency in arrival time for foods but mostly served quite quickly. Sashimi is served cold and fresh so that was very good. The BBQ skewers were not so good, they were served just a little warmed up. Seating was quite good. Even though it was quite busy, we have good spacing between all tables."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place for Sashimi lovers!,30,28 July 2018,"We went for the lunch buffet. There was a lot of fresh and delicious Sashimi. Very worth it if you are a Sashimi lover. There are other Japanese food (the usual sushi and handrolls) for those who don't eat Sashimi. When the lunch crowd came, service became quite slow. Our last 2 dishes took about 20min to come."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi and Jap food,40,11 July 2018,"We chanced upon this Jap buffet restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. Had a good time eating fresh sashimi non-stop. Restaurant was crowded and service was good, even though they missed out serving me my soft shell crab. A steal if you have Entertainer app.. $50 for 2 pax. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lousy experience,10,8 July 2018,"Was there to celebrate my kids birthday.Waitress could not understand english, and chose to ignore us upon seating us at our table.Our orders was missing in the system, asked for the manager, was again ignored.Wonder what kind of training was given to the wait staff, if at first you don't understand the guest, just ignore them?! Saw other tables guest, was waving for wait staff for service, and with visible displeasure as we were.Our bill came up to abt $200.00++, this is not a budget buffer, mind you.Was awarded favorite restaurant by bloggers, that is why we were there.Guess you have to be a blogger in order to get service.First time in my life, have to find food to fill up my stomach after a buffet lunch.Never again, will I step foot into this lousy restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Modrate Japanese Fare,30,26 June 2018,"Environment of restaurant comfortable and spacious. Staff able to respond for service. However, have seen better quality of Japanese buffet food elsewhere. Although electronic pad is used for making orders, there still seem to be items not being served. Thought that electronic orders would somehow be captured by the chefs and the service staff. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh and nice food,30,26 June 2018,Food served quite slow. Preferred a detachable iPad menu so to let other diners in the group can place their orders. Sad part was dessert is not included in the buffet. Restaurant quite noisy so not suitable to have serious talk there ;-)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,40,21 June 2018,Wide variety of food! Service was good and the dishes came fast. Salmon sashimi is fresh and thick. The birthday deal was value for money.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad,10,19 June 2018,I’m not going back there again. It costs me 60/pax for poor quality sashimi and sushi!!! So disappointing.....
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service,20,18 June 2018,Service was so slow. Alot of stuff we ordered did not come. Wait staff had to be reminded to check our order and still they bungled up.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre food and service,20,16 June 2018,"Went to their Katong Square restaurant on 15th June in the evening for their ala carte buffet. Food was of low quality, especially the sushi dishes. The yakitori items are either too salty or oily and the soup dishes are rather bland. Only the sashimi are worth trying as they tasted rather fresh. Some of the items we ordered were not served and we had to remind and chase the staff for those dishes to be served, even though the restaurant was not overly croweded .Service wise, most of the service staff were relatively polite and prompt in clearing the dishes . The only exception was the male manager of the restuarant, with a heavy malaysian accent and spoke maninly in chinese, was really rude and loud. When we had problem using the ipad gadget during ordering , the manager was standing nearby and thus we gestured to him for help . We were shocked when he walked towards us and raised his voice and asked us rudely in these exact words in chinese ""什么事？“ . He even stared at us as if we did something wrong. We were so taken aback by his rudeness that we were speechless for a while before we continued to ask him how to use the ipad. He did not utter a word and just pressed a few buttons on the ipad and walked off thereafter, leaving us wondering if our order was being placed. Never did we expect to receive such rude and bad service from the restaurant manager. Enough said, the full price (without any promotional discount) that we paid for such mediocre food and service was definitely not worthwhile and this will be our first and last visit."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent quality for a buffet. Good service though!,40,30 May 2018,"The ordering app worked great today, our orders arrived quick and accurately. Was apprehensive about the service based on reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. New staff Jay was especially helpful polite and friendly. You could see they try hard with English. What would have been nice was if tea was included in the price, instead of $1.90/pax"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Terrible service, average food",10,13 May 2018,"Went with my family for mother's day meal. And it just ruined the night for us.Firstly, they only offered buffet and not ala carte, which we weren't keen in the first place but since it was a special day, we decided to go ahead.Secondly, the ipad ordering system went down, yet some orders went through (multiple times). So we had to turn away a few repeat orders. But many dishes still didn't arrive. When we asked for an update of what were outstanding about an hour into the meal, the shocking answer was that they couldn't tell and told us to reorder via hardcopy. Then they proceeded to mess up our hardcopy orders. Some items never arrived and even after asking them to check, we waited for 20 mins with no news and updates on our food. By then, all the tables around us had already left and we were still left waiting for our food 2.5 hours after entering the restaurant.We would not have been that upset if the service was not terrible. Some staff was just blur, and one was just plain rude. When we highlighted these issues to the manager, all we got was a feeble and weak explanation. She didnt seem to understand the frustration and kept thinking that the issue was that we had outstanding orders. Service experience aside, the food was not worth it as well. Am never ever going back to Shin Minori again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Too much sauce with deep-fried items ,30,22 April 2018,"Went to the branch at Katong Square for the 1 for 1 ala carte buffet offer and was surprised at the stinginess of the cutlery, condiments (no ginger or wasabi on table), lack of plain water (1.80 for free flow hot tea/soft drink) and having to ask for more paper napkins. Ordering from the I - pad was a good idea as photos showed the items though some dishes didn't resemble the pictures eg. the fried asparagus, ebi, rolls inevitably came with a heavy slatherng of teriyaki or some other sauce, so salty and unnecessary that it spoilt the dishes!To be fair, the sashimi was fresh and tasty and the ramen with chicken quite tasty. Portions were appropriate small so diners could try more varieties. However the curry with rice was disappointing as the potatoes were not thoroughly cooked and we had to leave two pieces uneaten, such a waste of food. The pumpkin chawanmushi was unusual though rather too sweet. We wished there were more fresh salad choices as there seemed to be only the fried cabbage dish.Service was fine. Though busy, the wait staff were courteous and obliging.Verdict - only come if you can down endless plates of sashimi or bowls of ramen! Not a quality buffet but fairly priced with the one for one deal. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food but no special orders entertained,40,19 April 2018,"Tucked away at a really quiet mall (UE Square), lies this Japanese ala Carte buffet restaurant (it basically means that they prepare and serve whatever you order through the ipad). One annoying thing is that the app crashes from time to time and then we’d have to let in the orders again.The quality of food overall was great, and if you go during lunch and get the 1 for 1 (we went for dinner), this would be really great value for money! The staff were very conscientious in clearing the plates of food that we have finished eating.The main irritation was not we could not made any special orders - the feature on the ipad app does not work and the staff were insistent we could not modify any dish (basically we wanted the torches salmon aburi without the rice). Another surprising feature was that we were charged for drinks! Hot or cold green tea is usually included when we pay $40++ for a buffet..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet and Helpful staff!,40,15 March 2018,"(This review is meant for the Katong Square outlet)We were here for the ala carte buffet lunch and as we were early, only 1-2 tables were occupied then. (but shortly, many diners came and it was about 70% full).The restaurant is new (barely started operations no more than few months ago) has a nice and lovely ambience, cosy and it played Japanese songs and music which I think it was great and perfectly nice.We were ushered to a table by the staff, who was very friendly and patient in bringing us through the menu, and how to make the order via the tablet. It was quite ""high tech"" but once you got the hand of it, it was quite easy to operate.The spread of the buffet was quite extensive (over 100+ items), ranging from the sushi to salmon, ramen, udon, tempura, katsu etc. And quality was good too, would say most of the food items met our ""expectation"" or exceeded it. They were fresh, well marinated with tasty sauce and deep fried to perfection.The portion was great and relevant, to minimize wastage and yet sufficient to ""feed"" the hungry stomach. (anyway, you can reorder again and again)Service was overall good. Besides friendly and helpful staff, the used plates were promptly cleared despite of the quite big dinning crowd with only 2 servers! And our orders were also served quite fast unlike some other restaurants that would take a long time for the food to be served.Well, the only feedback we had were as follows. The airconditioning was very powerful and cold (at least from where we sat) and we felt ""freezing"" but luckily thanks to the hot ramen that saved us from the day!To our surprise, there was no dessert or cut fruits in the buffet spread. Usually most other ala carte Japanese buffet would have some ice creams, mochi, jelly and fresh cut fruits within the same price range, to be fair in comparison.Next, there was also no drinking water inclusive in the buffet! This was strange as most of the Japanese restaurants we had visited included that (not to mention some even included green tea, soft drinks or even coffee). A glass of iced water was chargeable at $0.80!!! Though refillable, we felt it was not worth it and so we skipped it (of course not ordering the other beverages as the price was not value for money).For pricing aspect, it was quite great value for money as there's an on-going 1-for-1 promotions for the buffet, so we ended up paying around $50+ for 2 persons, which was wonderful since we were able to try so many different Japanese food.We enjoyed the food here, having tried over 40+ items and if they would include drinking water and some desserts/fruits, it would receive a 5-star rating!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,40,25 February 2018,"Brought my family to their restaurant since my son didn’t have sashimi for a long while. It was almost closing when we got there, servers were too busy to attend us, and we have to wait a while though we have reservation before reaching. We were very hungry so placed orders for some sashimi and drinks first. Generous servings of food served, overall food quality is good. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",No fin with my nori at Shin Minori,20,21 February 2018,"The buffet menu is long, and encompasses all styles of Japanese cuisine (except shabu shabu). The quality is pretty awful, worse than Sakae Sushi. We tried this out with the Entertainer 1-for-1 offer; otherwise, at $41.90++ per pax it’s not worth it, with such poor quality. Contrary to other reviews, we found the wait time quite good. Service is pro-active. Maybe an acceptable choice for some, but sorry it ain’t us."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet (Using Birthday Voucher),40,21 February 2018,"Sashimi was fresh and in thick slices. However, the chawanmushi and the bbq stuff wasn't that great thought it doesn't matter as we are here for the Sashimi. Need to arrive early so that the wait for the orders will not be too long."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value for fresh sashimi,50,21 February 2018,Sashimi was fresh and buffet selection was extensive. Quality of food served was great for the price we were paying. Service staffs were attentive to refill iced green tea
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An awesomet experience,50,20 February 2018,I had dinner with my family at Shin Minori Katong Square and have tried their buffet. Food was delicious and service was great.My next visit to Singapore I will not hesitate to go back and enjoy their delicious menu.With lot of choices sometimes waiting time is an issue however our experience was wonderful. I cannot wait go back...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Midori,20,16 February 2018,Food quality was not as good as previous round and waiting time was very long as our orders did not pass through the system and wasn't detected by staff. We had to keep asking and resubmit order again..
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unacceptably Long Waiting Time,20,16 February 2018,"Although the food was value-for-money, the waiting time for the food was way too long. Furthermore, staff seemed to lack communication and coordination amongst one another. When the food arrived, the number of portions we ordered for each dish were inaccurate, usually giving us a lesser amount than we ordered. Perhaps the system of ordering through an iPad during peak hours could be revised and an alternative method for ordering can be implemented if the kitchen and staff are unable to cope with the overwhelming number of orders being entered in a short period of time. Hopefully this can be improved on ASAP. By doing so, this will naturally improve the restaurant atmosphere. Thanks. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Katong doesn’t consider Yusheng as food,10,13 February 2018,"Ordered a Yusheng from Shin Minori Katong, when we went to collect we are greeted by a very loud & attitude not so good staff but that’s only the beginning of the bad service.When we asked were the chopsticks already packed? His reply was the most ridiculous & absurd reply we ever heard. His reply was chopsticks are only given for food order, at that moment we were like, you mean Yusheng is not food?!Then he continued he ridiculousness, by saying we don’t normally give chopsticks for Yusheng because all people buy home to eat mah & house sure got chopsticks what. We were speechless by such ignorance assumptions & bad attitude."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible Service From the Manager,10,31 January 2018,"Horrible service from the waitress and manager. Waitress made a mistake with one of the apps, told us she will ask the manager will honour it...just to get the final bill without anything honoured and manager refusing. What happened to the service it use to have 3 years back?"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Everything is sweet except sashimi,30,31 January 2018,Sashimi is good but everything else is sweet..... not really value for money as the pricing is quite high and calories is wasted for the meal.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Poor service, average food",20,22 January 2018,Food quality are average and inconsistent. Food are served very slowly and staffs are not very helpful when checking on orders.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet dinner,40,20 January 2018,Went for dinner. Place was smaller than expected and tables were quite close to one another even though there were makeshift dividers. Sushi was not bad but cooked food can be a little salty. Overall a little pricey.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner Buffet,40,20 January 2018,"The food quality has improved compared to last time I dine here. The service is good too. They clear your plates regulary. However, the lights in the restaurant is quite dim. I don't like to dine in so dark ambience but because of the food, I will come back again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was above average,40,18 January 2018,"Great price, food was tasty and they had quite a spread for me to choose from. Heard good reviews about it before I decided to try it personally and it did not disappoint me."

Definitely worth every cent.
Seafood was fresh, grilled meat was juicy and service was timely.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Celebrations and desserts,40,15 January 2018,"I was a little disappointed as they do not have anything special for an actual day birthday celebration.A slice of cake for the birthday person would be a nice gesture. Nevertheless, we ordered a slice of cake and they provided the candle.The dessert and cakes were ala carte orders, not included in the buffet menu, yet the cake did not taste fresh.Other than these, the service and food were great!Will still recommend them for the Japanese buffet. There is a good range of varieties to choose from. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Lunch Buffet,50,8 January 2018,The lunch buffet at Shin Minori is great! The selection and quality of food is really good. The service staff are also very friendly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",the food not fresh,10,7 January 2018,the fish all is too hard and not fresh. it is weird when you eat the food with hard feeling. Fish is a soft meat. The shashimi is just ok.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food ok , seating terrible",30,7 January 2018,"Food was ok, the service was average but the seating arrangement for 2pax was terrible. 4 tables of 2 seaters were squeezed tightly together with a Wooden panel to separate but it was claustrophobic in the middle 2 seats coz it’s too close to each other. For the price of the buffet , the seating arrangement was terrible. Felt like fast food joint. Won’t go back again . "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant @ UE Square,40,2 January 2018,Celebrated my birthday at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant @ UE Square. Food was served quite fast. Very good!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quite a bad choice for Jap food,10,1 January 2018,"I went there with my boyfriend for a casual dinner. We tried most of the items on the menu ranging from the sashimi, yakitori, udon and so on, but hardly any dish tasted satisfactory. The yakitori had a sauce on it which was extremely sweet that the dish felt like a dessert. The miso soup was bland. The soup of the kake udon was okayyy but the noodles are too soft, not sure if it is cooked for too long or what. The sushi were also just okay, i personally think places like koh grill and genki have better sushi though.. The lighting of the place is also rather dim, so it kinda brings in the sleepy feel especially after some food. Overall it was not a very nice experience and we didnt really enjoyed it. Its certainly not worth the price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good ala carte Japanese buffet,40,1 January 2018,"Good ala carte Japanese buffet with several different dishes and cooking styles.
Buffet price does not include drinks and plain water is chargeable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome value for money,40,30 December 2017,"If you have a craving for sashimi, this is where you should go. And you get much more - an extensive menu that includes yakitori, sushi, agemono and much much more. A must try. I’ll surely be visiting again. My only gripe - the service could have been more attentive. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall bad,10,30 December 2017,Food was not fresh resulting in us having the runs for 2 days. Service staff was not friendly and had a bit of black face when we asked to top up the drinks. Overall we didnt enjoy the food as much as before. Standard definitely dropped. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Authentic Japanese food served,50,28 December 2017,The food served was fresh and delicious while service was excellent with the staffs always providing attentive service
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Its okay.. not worth the money,30,27 December 2017,"Paid $72.74 per pax with gst and service charge with green tea. Original price was $59.90++ during this ""festive"" period. Beverages needed to be top up separately. Went on Xmas Eve, restaurant was only 60% full, we were there from 7pm to 9pm. Its an ala-carte buffet, serving speed was ok. Salmon sashimi was quite fresh. Maki has too much rice, hence dont order too much. Yaki dishes, my friends love. Edamame was served hot, strangely. Mentaiko spaghetti was bland, dont try. Zaru soba was soggy, dont try. Chawanmushi was good, try it. Complimentary snow crab served was good. thank you. Good to try on non-festive periods, but still on the pricier side, wont go again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service & food quantity can be improved,30,25 December 2017,The food quantity is too little per serving then up we must keep ordering and their service of clearing the plates is quite slow but service standards still considered quite okay..
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice restaurant,40,25 December 2017,"The booking is fast, easy and simple.
Quite a lot of food choices, even though some of the food they serve very slow and have get wrong items serve to our table but they quickly response to us."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not too good,20,19 December 2017,Had the lunch buffet. Fish wasn't very fresh imo and some were slightly sour. Nothing that really stood out frankly quite disappointing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food choices not as great,30,18 December 2017,"Was here for dinner, I liked that they had a lot of choices for yakitori. But they did lack choices in terms of other cooked foods. Service was fairly good and price is also acceptable, overall experience was still acceptable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese restaurant,30,17 December 2017,reasonable pricing but space to small for good dining experience. Staff are friendly but they spoke mandarin which not everyone is able to communicate. Although the ordering process is good and high tech but the older customers will find it a challenge trying to use the pad for ordering their dishes. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing,20,16 December 2017,"This was not my first visit but i was greatly disappointed with the poor service and poor quality of food. The tuna sashimi did not have any taste, the grilled dishes we had, were bad. The quail eggs had a plastic texture, the chicken liver were hard and dry, the chicken skin was just hard and has a burnt smell. The service staff simply placed the plates at the corner of the table, despite space in the middle of table. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,40,14 December 2017,We enjoyed the food as the portion is decent and the quality is better than we expected for buffet. The only thing that can be better is cleanliness of the place as our seats initially were dirty which the waiter offered to clean up for us and the floor had paper napkins too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly staff & nice food,40,11 December 2017,Staff are friendly . Food is nice . Unable to try all as too many variety to choose. Will definitely go again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Japanese food,50,11 December 2017,"I have been to Shin Minori several times in the past. Always a great experience. Last week I had a visiting colleague from Japan (native Japanese). I decided to take him to Shin Minori. High risk, right ? Never take someone from a foreign country, familiar with how their food should be, to a restaurant of their heritage, for them to compare against, right ?I had confidence in Shin Minori, as my prior experiences were all great.My friend gave Shim Minori 2 thumbs up! (I wasn't all that surprised!).The sushi, Temaki (hand rolls) were great (but how can you mess up raw fish,right?). The cooked meals were also great (and that was where the real challenge was). Tori Wasabi Mayo (Grilled chicken with wasabi mayo), Kani Tenpura (soft shell crab), Yaki Onigiri (Grilled minced chicken balls), so many other items to choose from, all great.Great service. Great ambiance."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi ,30,9 December 2017,Sashimi are fresh. Wide variety of choices. Udon & Soba not to expectation. Overall rating is average.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of food but slow service,30,5 December 2017,"Liked the fact that the variety of food is really wide, but the service is really slow though. Some of our dishes took quite awhile to arrive, while others were forgotten. One came only when we were able to leave."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Little variety available & slow service,20,3 December 2017,"Went on a weekday lunch and there were only a few other tables occupied. Despite it not being packed, the food was being served slow. Coupled with the little variety available for its buffet, doubt we will return in the near future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent salmon sashimi slices!,50,2 December 2017,Came here with a few friends for dinner last week and was amazed at the more than 130+ items on the menu. The sashimi slices were thick and we had a huge spread of food on our table. Reasonably priced too!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",LOVE IT,50,2 December 2017,"this is my go to restaurant for jap buffet, esp with its 1 for 1 deal. cheap but quality food and a wide variety of choices !"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Just a gathering of old friends ,40,30 November 2017,"We are a group of 4 old school pals meeting up for dinner. This place was offered quite a good spread for an ala carte buffet! You get sashimi and sushi, tempura and some meat dish too. They also have noodles like soba and udon. Overall it’s a very good deal if you like JAPANESE food. Don’t expect fine dining but I’ll say that they are above average. I’d definitely return another day!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So far food not bad n fast service too.,40,30 November 2017,More variety will be good as no soft shell crab. If can provide drinks will be much more better as price not cheap for lunch buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,30,30 November 2017,Overall food quality is quite good and value for money. However the beef cooked in onion and special sauce has a very strong smell of beef and portion given is too big for 2.Tables for 2 are placed too close to each other so can be very noisy. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet ,30,30 November 2017,"This is my second time coming here for their Buffet. Food is still as good but I felt that the standard dropped a little. Their food portion became smaller. The maki we ordered used to have grilled cheese on top that made is taste so darn good but right now all they have is the just some sauce drizzled on top of it. Also the yaki tori gizzard that we ordered were so small. It was cut into very tiny pieces unlike before where it’s was much bigger. On a side note, the store fried beef was really good. You have to try that one. Our overall experience was good although our orders took some time to come. Food and service was good. Would give it a 3.5 rating if I could. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,40,29 November 2017,"The selection was quite wide and sashimi was fresh. Especially loved the salmon and swordfish sashimi. The maki rolls were great as well, it was rare to see innovative maki rolls (like rainbow roll, dragon) offered in a buffet instead of the usual California roll. Of course the taste still cannot beat an ala carte order of dragon roll at other japanese restaurant but I am satisfied as it was to have it on the buffet menu. The waiting time can take sometime during busy hours. Best to go early and order quickly."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Free Birthday treat redemption,30,29 November 2017,"There’s no free lunch, any Free treat comes with a Min condition- 1 adult Ala Carte buffet lunch excl drink.For ala Carte lunch of $40++ (Tax incl) per pax rate in near town, UE Square, consider ex but value for 2 though with limited public accessibility.We paid for 2 pax with drinks total spent $105+/- for a family of 3 buffet lunch on birthday. So it’s not Free in our context.As the voucher is for all year redemption, so it’s subjective to individual Budget.AC Buffet offers wide spreads, recommended sashimi, chawanmushi, handrolls & teppanyaki/bbq items.Tried most of the recommended on menu, some good some average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome experience,50,28 November 2017,"Awesome experience. Food is good and fresh. Service is ok, free birthday cake, and ambiance is great for family gathering too."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great Food, Not-so-Fantastic Service",40,23 November 2017,"Headed over to Shin Minori (UE Square outlet) for the lunch buffet on last Sunday afternoon, because of the pleasant experience sometime in June.Took a little while before we were shown to our seats, but completely understandable due to the staff busy serving the many tables. However, when indicating to the supervisor/manager about a promotion code that we would like to utilise for the lunch buffet, he seemed rather disgruntled, where instructions for us to redeem the code sounded rather blunt. We felt the tone was rather uncalled for, as discount or not, we are still paying patrons. Nonetheless, we brushed it off rather quickly, and waited for our orders to arrive.Food arrived and they were as great as the previous time we had visited. The raw fish tasted fresh, and the Dragonfly Sushi was one of our favorites such that we had ordered twice. The meat dishes were nothing to shout about, but were still good. We were a little disappointed, though that a version of the cheese croquet (previously available) was not there anymore. The staff attending to us did not quite understand what we were conveying too well, probably because she was new to the job.So 2.50pm came and the same manager/supervisor came round our table, shoving the bill to us, and the tone used in informing us of the closing time felt rather pushy. While we understand the place closes at 3pm, we felt that a different tone used would have made the experience more pleasant, instead of making customers feel like they are being chased out.All in all, for the food we will definitely head back again, with hope that the next dining experience will be somewhat better."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty fresh sashimi,40,22 November 2017,Sashimi is fresh and waitresses are friendly. I like the sashimi. Lacks dessert though and would have been great if 5hey offer ice cream.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,40,20 November 2017,"Even though the waiting time for the food is a bit long, but I think is okay since the food is nice. (You order through the tablet)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",friendly gd service though slow at peak lunch time,30,20 November 2017,"friendly gd service though slow at peak lunch time. v crowded on a Friday and tables were so close i can see and hear everything the couple said beside us. sashimi was thick and great. tempura were hot and crispy, even the tempura sauce. extensive grilled items menu which was great too.the rice items eg the hand rolls/temaki, sushi, and sushi rolls were not good though. ridiculous amount of rice."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,30,19 November 2017,"Not the first time come here, reasonable price for japanese buffet. Service is not the best, but food is good"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Japanese Buffet!,50,19 November 2017,"Arguably one of the best Japanese buffets I've ever had so far. If you're really particular about your sashimi, then Shin Minori probably wouldn't disappoint as their thickly-sliced sashimi is really fresh and delicious. I'd certainly go back there again for my next sashimi indulgence."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher,50,19 November 2017,"Great deal when there is a birthday voucher. Reservation went smoothly, food selection is great while sashimi is a steal."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese buffet!,50,18 November 2017,"I've been here before and loved it, so I brought my mum this time so she could try it too. Very reasonable pricing for such great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the portions generous. This is a good choice because everyone gets to order what they want (not hampered by different preferences)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,50,17 November 2017,Good selection of Japanese food at this ala carte buffet. The yakitori especially was really good. The sashimi was really fresh. Would have been even better if other drinks and dessert were included.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Will never come here again & neither should you!,10,16 November 2017,"Decided to visit Shin Minori after reading raving reviews online.Firstly the food was substandard.Nothing like the impressions I read from other reviews.Worst of all, I was denied a credit card promotion just because the staff said so.Terms and conditions on their website wasn’t clearly written resulting in great ambiguity."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",good food,40,15 November 2017,"salmon was fresh but swordfish slightly off that day. nevertheless, the rest of the food was decent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,40,13 November 2017,Buffet is pretty good. Ordering is done through a tablet. However a cup of ice water or green tea costs money!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,40,12 November 2017,Buffet spread was quite big but I wished desserts were included. Sashimi was good and I love their stir-fried beef dish!!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",nice food,40,12 November 2017,food was nice. serving was fast. just the place is too cramp. table to table too close. can't talk freely. no privacy. just eat.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin minori,50,12 November 2017,"Really love the quality of food here! It’s also quite affordable, lunch buffet was $40++/per and if it’s your birthday month you can also get to dine for free with mins 2 adults"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet worth it!,40,11 November 2017,"Worth the money, selection interesting but just go for sashimi!
Orders can be delayed and missed. Otherwise worth a visit."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",You pay for what you get.. ,30,11 November 2017,"For the affordable prices, you get average quality food and below average service levels.
Also, the place looks like it needs a revamp badly.
Not a place for serious lovers of Japanese cuisine.. read connoisseurs."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So So...,30,10 November 2017,"Food was average, service was less than average. Tori skewer was cannot make it at all.. taste dry and not much of flavouring."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good spread,40,9 November 2017,Value for money. The restaurant serves a good spread with fresh sashimi. Atmosphere is cozy and suitable for family or friends gathering.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall not bad,30,9 November 2017,"Food was not bad, but sashimi could have been fresher. Grilled dishes were very salty, so was the agedashi tofu. Worth it given the birthday voucher but if not for it then probably not. iPad ordering is good but can include a page on the outcome of the food i.e. an ordered list, cooking/preparing list and then a served list so that customers know what dishes has arrived, what they have ordered and hasn't arrived and what dishes they are eating. iPad also better to be held, not clamped to table as it was quite hard to maneuver. But overall not bad, service good too. Would go again if there's similar discount/1-1."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor experience @ Shin Minori,20,6 November 2017,"The ambience of the restaurant was reasonable. Service was slow to response and the AI ordering system was not friendly at all. The touch Pad home button was poorly fitted into a metal housing hole which was poorly done and needed really very small fingers to access. Food quality was good but slow to be served after the ordering. My overall experience was average for the restaurant, compensating was the waitress who was very helpful to take photos for us. If you want to be good, you must look into the touch Pads and the holding structures. AI Technology should enhance the ordering experience and not to turn guest away. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An awesome Japanese buffet,40,6 November 2017,Minori has always been my favourite Jap buffet restaurant due to its affordability and wide range of selection. Ambience is great too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only worth it if you got birthday voucher,40,6 November 2017,Abit pricy at $40++ for weekday lunch buffet. Sashimi and sushi are nice. Only worth it if one of you has the birthday voucher.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Thumbs Up,50,3 November 2017,Been to shin minori many times. love the fresh sashimi and its value for money especially when dine on your birthday day month.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Staff Service & Food portion at UE Square,30,2 November 2017,The foods are delicious but portion of the food for each order for the ala carte buffet is too small. The staffs are not proactive to provide spoons & wasabi when soup and sushi are served. Have to ask for wasabi twice before it was served.Servers are chinese speaking. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Clean and decent,40,2 November 2017,I like the concept of the restaurant where you are served the food ordered through a tablet. Its a better buffet in that sense.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fantastic food,50,2 November 2017,very good selection. love how they had pumpkin in their chawanmushi. got to try their japanese fried rice and mentaiko spaggheti! Not salty yet fragrant! sashimi is melt-in-mouth even for tuna which normally doesn't taste well in most japanese restaurants! Price is very reasonable and service is quick!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Bold claims but only good, not great.",30,31 October 2017,"We had a family dinner for 7 at their Katong Square outlet. Selection was decent enough and the sashimi was nice. Not what I would consider “great japanese ala-carte buffet” cos we’ve had better. Perhaps a sign of this was a really small number of tables were occupied tonight. Perhaps they make up during weekends. Sashimi was nice but not the best based on price. Tempura was nice but a bit on the oily side and batter wasn’t light enough. Pasta was sticking and clumping up. Grilled selection was either bland, which I’m ok with since I appreciate natural flavours but the sauce for some grilled selection like chicken liver was way too salty. Wasabi wasn’t evenly fresh with some bits with a lil kick but mostly bland. Grilled pork with garlic had an overkill of garlic to the point where it drowned out the flavour of the pork. All in all, good for a one time visit but I won’t be going back anytime soon. Good but not great. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food and value for money,40,30 October 2017,"This is my second visit to the restaurant. After my first visit , the experience was good and decided to bring my family down for a meal since it was my daughter birthday as well. The food was well portion as instruction was clear on the ipad on how many piece was served. The sashimi was fresh and we all enjoyed our self. Will definitely be back in the future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi Lover's Heaven,30,30 October 2017,"The restaurant serve a huge range of fresh and premium sashimi. It's delicious! Food were served hot. However, agemono dishes were disappointing, batter was too thick."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food is good but expensive for kids,50,30 October 2017,"The food is good but the pricing is quite high for children, only $10 cheaper compared to adult price. Certain dish was served very late. I liked the chawamushi with pumpkin sauce. Empty dishes were cleared very fast which is a plus point especially when the tables are not spacious."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friday night,40,29 October 2017,"Food came pretty fast but somehow because it was a Friday night, a lot of our orders came in repeat ! Maybe can opt going on mon-thurs when there's less people to avoid such. Food was okay not bad for a Japanese buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Gd for casual dining,30,28 October 2017,"Service and food was a little slow as the restaurant was quite busy, but food was ok. There was a good variety of food. And love the snow crab soup. Jus remember to print out the voucher."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worthiness of the buffet lunch,40,28 October 2017,My favourite dish is fried baby cuttlefish and chicken wing. Raw salmon is fresh and juice. May be can try to ask for tables with portable ipad for making order instead of the one that stick onto the partition.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",jap buffet,40,27 October 2017,quite a variety of food. sashimi is fresh and tasty. other cooked foods are so-so. desserts and beverages not included in the buffet and chargeable. service is so-so.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",first visit,40,23 October 2017,good overall experience. prompt confirmation of reservation but was not aware of 2 shifts until i call up.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,50,23 October 2017,"Sashimi swordfish, octopus, tempura and pumpkin chawanmushi were good. Lesser variety for teppanyaki. Should have included free flow green tea in the buffet menu instead of charging it separately in the bill. Used the birthday voucher on that day."

Hope next attempt I can see the improvement from you all
Thanks"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Birthday Treat,40,15 October 2017,Food was yummy and service was good. Food came piping hot and fresh. I gave it a 4/5 because there is no desert on the menu. Otherwise would have been a perfect 5.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not impressed with food. Poor service.,20,13 October 2017,"Utilised the birthday voucher, and tried it out for the first time. Not impressed with food but worse is the service. The sushi rice vinegar was too overloaded. The yakitori items were overcooked. Finally the service was very the 不甘愿。Its ok because we will not be patronising again even if there is free dining for both. In addition, first time using Chope Reservation and the number 68714254 kept calling me to confirm despite me having confirmed after reservation, then 15 mins before reservation and then after being in restaurant for 30 mins already. It auto called me back when I ended the call and in the end, I had to block the number. Will steer clear of Chope Reservation in the future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very good,40,9 October 2017,"Food is good but would be better if there are more varieties for the buffet. Only salmon sashimi and steamed egg chawanmushi were served fast, the rest took quite a Long time. Longest was like half an hour for the chicken wing. Suggest to order more things at one go so that You don't have to wait so Long. Saw a mini spider on the table btw."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Ala-Carte Buffet Spread,40,9 October 2017,"We went on a Friday lunch for the ala-carte buffet - it was quite crowded and the dishes took awhile to come. They tend to miss out certain dishes if you order a variety of dishes at once, so try to order in small quantities. Also, note that the drinks and dessert are not included in the buffet. Regardless, the staff were friendly; the best thing was the sashimi, which was really fresh and good value for money. Their sushi options are interesting and taste good too."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Decent food, poor service",40,9 October 2017,"Shin Minori provides you with the typical buffet experience- you can get quite a bit of average food for your money, but the service is sub-par. Many of the servers didn't speak English and weren't able to understand our requests. The food came out relatively quickly except for the grill items, and when we were missing a lot of items we ordered, the wait staff told us that all the orders had been fulfilled. We therefore re-ordered the missing items and they showed up twice (beware of this happening as there is a food wastage charge of $10/100g). The food is decent, though you shouldn't be expecting the most high quality sushi from a buffet restaurant. The gyoza was quite good, as well as the fried soft-shell crabs. It was an easy place to go with a large group and share lots of items. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Feeling so sad with the order and staff,20,8 October 2017,"At 1st we request to chance sit, but staff ingrone us2nd the taplet when we use for place order always connect error 3rd the food that we order never come staff still blame that is we never place order. Any way this is 3rd time I go, but the service become worse and worse... "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Always satisfying,50,7 October 2017,"Came many times , this time was the birthday voucher so we came back. Sashimi quality is good.
The rest are all good too. Worth the visit if you haven't been here. Try go during promotions."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth eating for the value,40,3 October 2017,Enjoy the food and the services are good too as the waitress clear the empty plates automatically without us to call for.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection of food.,30,3 October 2017,There was a great selection of food but I didn’t not manage to try them all. Those that I tried taste pretty good but the staffs seems a bit short handed.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it,30,2 October 2017,"The dishes are terrible, does not match the pictures. Also the addition of random sauces on the various dishes spoil the taste. Portions are always inconsistent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",AT $41.90++ PER PAX FOR DINNER YET NO FREE WATER!,30,2 October 2017,"This review has a good rating.I must have visited at least 6 times in the last couple of years. In awe for the first few visits but not last night. My son’s second visit and he said he will return. Perhaps my expectations were higher or I didn’t enjoy any ambience there. There was none to mention. Sashimi especially the salmon, yellow tail and sword fish were fresh. Some maki and skewers were good. But a couple of dishes were very salty. Service was lacking. The vegetables tempura was the first few items my son ordered and did not arrive until the end of our dinner. We had to remind them at least 5 times because each time we were told another 2 or 3 minutes.It is already quite pricey and yet water is chargeable at 80 cents and green tea at $1.90. I can’t. Personally, I won’t go back but if my son wanted to, I will go with him. And I didn’t even take any pictures last night."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent food,50,29 September 2017,The sashimi was fresh and thickly cut. The sushi and yakitori didn't fail to impress either. Will visit again!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch on Sunday,30,27 September 2017,Crowded. Food is average. Some food not cook in Japanese way like quail egg. They fried it before grill. The cold dish sour plum cucumber..they did not use Japanese cucumber so the taste was weird. 1 order paper was tucked under 1pc of our salmon teriyaki. Is not a hygiene way of serving. My Japanese friends are not impressed. I was shocked too. The order tablet hang at least 3 times and created double order. We showed the staff we had already finished our food but the service staff kept showing us 2 orders of same food. We thought is our mistake so we accepted it. The 3rd times it happened we spoke to someone higher and he was more understanding and removed the extra food we did not order. Is my first time at Shin Minori and is a little disappointing experience for a Japanese Restaurant. I may try again if they improve on food quality and hygiene standard.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",excellent,50,25 September 2017,"loved the food! loved the spread. really enjoyed it.
would come back again.
my mates enjoyed it as well."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Water bottle full of mold,30,25 September 2017,"We've dined in this restaurants regularly for a few years. The food quality is pretty consistent throughout. However, I must say the service is not as good as before and the sitting space is getting smaller and smaller. In our last visit to Shin Minori last weekend, the water bottle that they gave us with the ice water is full of mold! No kidding, I wish i could post a photo here....tsk tsk"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Can go to japanese buffet restaurant,50,24 September 2017,No fuss restaurant. Was quite pack when we got there. Better to get reservation early to avoid disappointment. Although during peak hours your orders tend to come slower

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Abundance of food at reasonable price,40,20 September 2017,Good quality food and attentive service. Good cut of Sashimi and fresh. Don't miss the Fried chicken. However the grilled items with salt needed more flavouring. No dessert included for buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,30,20 September 2017,"Food was average but decent for the price. However, we faced a lot of technical difficulties during ordering. Our ipad failed like five times and had to ask for assistance. That certainly affected our dining experience as we had to resubmit all our orders."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible experience,10,17 September 2017,"I will never go back to this restaurant. Stated 80 cents for cold water and free refill. Ordered one for son's girlfriend cos my son and i are not in the habit of drinking water while eating. Refill was good until when the crowd came in. Asked to refill, manager came to tell me that it's the restaurant's policy for customer to order the no. of water accdg to the no.of pax. Tried to see their fine prints but couldn't find. Felt insulted tat he's implying we shared, saving$1.60 after having tho pay close to$150 for the meal. So we told them no need to refill. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Accommodating staff,50,17 September 2017,Good service and food. I was late but they still served me the lunch irregardless. Great service. Good variety.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Family dinner cum birthday celebration,30,17 September 2017,"We booked this place through Chope to celebrate our second kid's birthday. Trying out for the first time. We end there at 630pm Sat (it was also the F1 weekend) It was quite crowded by the time we went there and full house by around 7 plus. Every one there went for the buffet. Order system was via the ipad/samsung tab. Our food was served after that.Servings was generally small portions to very small portions - more like for one person servings. We thought it was fine as this will help to minimize wastage.There was 5 of us, so when our initial order was served, we quickly adjusted and order more servings for each item. Overall the food and experience was just average. The staff and service was ok. For us, the most important was that the family had a good time and the birthday kid liked the meal treat. It was memorable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent,50,17 September 2017,"Excellent food, sashimi is fresh, and their maki is my favourite . Great service. Nerve fail to dissapoint us.."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value and excellent quality ,50,17 September 2017,"Cosy restaurant parked in a not so crowded UE shopping mall.... good thing.Restaurant usually packed so reservations recommended. Have private rooms and floor seating sections too. Would be better if there were more space to cater for many more patrons.The buffet alacarte menu is commendable. The spread is wide and quality of the food served is excellent. Sections of sashimi, sushi, tempura, maki, rolls, barbecue, salad, noodles, rice, and much more.Good and fast service and orders are placed thru electronic apps (tablets). Sushi and barbecue orders takes a bit longer though as it's made fresh.The buffet price excludes dessert and drinks, though.... and kids below 5 yrs old eat for free & child rates up to 10 yrs old.Highly recommended and happy eating."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb selection and quality of food!,40,14 September 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Shin Minori. Some colleagues and I visited for their lunch buffet and to our amazement, the claim of having more than 160 dishes is fo'real! There was a wide selection of dishes from rice and noodles to soup, sushi, sashimi, appetizers, maki, yakitori and teppanyaki - all this for $45 (including service charge and government tax). Service was good and the waiters were very responsive. The ambience is quiet and peaceful and I like that they do not enforce a time limit for the buffet. A little tip: if you go on their website, you'll find vouchers for special add-on items (for free). We were gifted a free snow crab nabe that was deeelicious! I have recommended this place to friends and family and will definitely be doing a second round there. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent experience,50,14 September 2017,"As usual, the salmon sashimi is a draw for me. Very good! Won't be my last time. Will look forward to going again with my family."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Easy.,50,11 September 2017,Booking is easy. The food is great. It comes out on time too. The service could be better. They werent very friendly when our tablet (to order food) wasn't working and loss all our previous orders so we had to restart.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very bad atmosphere,30,11 September 2017,"Very unlucky that the next table is a group of ladies who talk loudly.
It was really terrible and they really ruined the great atmosphere!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Chope is AWESOME, Shin Midori used to be too...",30,11 September 2017,"Food was alright. Service got messy due to crowd. Many disruption for wifi digital food ordering too. Avoid going on Fridays especially if you want to be having a peaceful, comfortable and enjoyable get together. Loud noisy big groups made the place so rowdy and noisy that you can hardly even hear yourself. Popularity equates to such I guess. Quite turning off. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Slightly pricey, but good quality",40,11 September 2017,"Had birthday voucher for one free buffet lunch, but still found it on pricier side. Food was mostly fresh because prepared on the spot. Sashimi a bit fishy, and beef dish was dry and overcooked. Fried items were really great though! Food portions were very thoughtfully adjusted for tasting amounts, but became way too much later on. Overall, good variety and quality!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch at Shin Minori,40,5 September 2017,"The Japanese Buffet spread is good and it is value for money. The service is good and the ambience is also conducive. Just feel that perhaps, Shin Minori can provide free flow of soft drinks."

I wish the sashimi was better. i like the complimentary dish. One or two items were a little salty. But overall it was okay.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was average,30,3 September 2017,"The food was alright, not terribly impressive or yummy. Had been hoping to get the birthday free buffet but unfortunately, we were told we couldn't get it on public holidays. That wasn't stated in the birthday treat page. What's more, that day itself was my husband's birthday! All orders were done via an ipad — would have been nice to be able to key in special requests in there. They had the option to select but could not key in anything, so as good as not having."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not so good,30,2 September 2017,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. As usual, the sashimi were fresh. But the grill is not so good, either it's over cooked or too dry. It might be due to the crowded as the restaurant was packed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebration,20,1 September 2017,"I have recently visited another japanese buffet lunch with similar price, Shin Minori can't compete in the following areas : food quality, food quantity, menu display (does not show actually serving quantity)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was good but disappointed overall.,30,31 August 2017,"I picked this restaurant to have my birthday lunch as it had a birthday promo for the lunch a-la-carte buffet. Prior that day I had signed up and received a voucher which I didn't know had to be screenshotted (they did not send a copy to my email). The day before I was due for lunch, I looked in my email for a copy of the voucher but it wasn't there so so tried to apply for it again. And when I did, the website prompted me that I have already been registered. To cut the Long story short, when I explained to the staff about the mix-up, he deliberately just told me that there was nothing I could do about it. Which was a rather weak attempt at service recovery, in my opinion. I considered walking out (I had not ordered yet) but still decided to give the place a shot. I paid for 2 buffets with 2 bottles of sake and was satisfied with the meal however, it was one of the lower moments on my birthday. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",feedback on service,40,29 August 2017,"Good is nice with various variety, but service not so good. Had ordered food, waited very long, did not serve and was asked to reorder again when we checked out order. Was told no more order chit with them."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic and excellent place!,50,22 August 2017,"Came on a busy Sunday afternoon for the lunchtime buffet using the Entertainer app (1-for-1 promotion). We ordered the sashimi platter several times and it was amazing. Highly recommend the sashimi (Tuna and Salmon) as it is very fresh. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. However, with that being said, I think the place can also improve further. For example, my partner and I were seated at a table which was very squeezy. We were placed next to the utensils drawers. It ruined the ambience for me, as I was constantly listening to the staff pulling and closing the drawers (it was very loud as well). The restaurant uses the ""tablet menu"", and for my partner and I, the table was already small enough (2 platters and the table would be too full for even a cup of water), there was no space (no drawer, compartment below table) for the tablet so we had to lean it against the wall standing up. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value!,40,22 August 2017,Came for birthday one for one lunch buffet. Sashimi is fresh! Would visit again when there are promotions - next year

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,40,16 August 2017,Brought my dad there for lunch and we both really enjoyed the freshness of the sashimi and overall food quality. Hope to see some little desserts included in the ala carte buffet to end off the meal. Dropped a star as i felt the tables were placed so close to each other that we were able to hear each other's conversations.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hmm,40,14 August 2017,Good food but price has creep up a little since last visit. The buffet will be more appealing if free flow tea is included. Sashimi is fresh.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummy Japanese buffet,40,14 August 2017,"Great selection of food, the sashimi is really fresh and they are generous with the portions. Maki and cooked food also quite decent. Only items our group didn't like were the grilled items (mainly the items on skewer) as the restaurant had grilled all items until they were too dry! Sometimes food came slower as it got busier but still ok.Star items: sashimi, grilled salmon, unagi items."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awful Experience !,10,10 August 2017,"This is by far one of the WORST Japanese restaurant !Food served was extremely salty ! Food is marinate with salt ONLY ! ( If you love salty food ! go for it )Raw fish served has a fishy smell as compare to others.Staff service was worst - don't expect a smile from any staff. ( If they ever smile at you , CONGRATS ! you are really lucky)"

The quality of food is good and I especially like the portion of food served. Most food was served a piece at a time allowed us to decide if we want more of those food which we ordered previously. The waiters are attentive and extended help almost immediately when the computer system hanged. Will visit again! 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,30,5 August 2017,"The resturant was quite crowded, i believed it is because of its jap buffet offering. The sashimi was good, but the rest of them was average or below average, especially the yakitori, the sauce is very bad and cold. The green tea is blant, service was ok"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",UE Square - Shin Minori,40,4 August 2017,The buffet is value for money but the price does not include drinks. Food is nice and the ambience is suitable for big group.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Rude, Sarcastic and Self ordering app that kept crashing ",10,2 August 2017,Cashier was poor in explaining use of Entertainer App and misled us to purchase the app usage instead of voucher for buffet. Subsequently accused us of non payment while being rude and sarcastic. Self ordering app in iPad kept crashing and we waited in vain for food that did not turn up. Reorders were made but not all the food arrived. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Jap buffet,40,2 August 2017,"Not the usual kind of buffet where you walk around to get your food but you order from and iPad. Food was ok, nothing special. Lots of variety though!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unpleasant experience at Shin Minori,20,2 August 2017,"The service was bad - preferential treatment for those having the ala carte buffet. When my family and Indonesian family friends were there last weekend, we were advised after being seated that our food would arrive in 20-30 min because they will service those going for the ala carte buffet first. As we were using the Entertainer app, they told us that the free items would be the chawanmushi after seeing that we had ordered it. We then asked whether we could cancel the orders since it had only been a few minutes since we ordered. However, we were informed that it was too late because the chawanmushi had already been prepared and was about to be served to us. The chawanmushi for ala carte buffet goers is different because our chawanmushi contained a prawn. As such, I would not recommend going to this restaurant unless you want to go for their ala carte buffet. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good service,50,31 July 2017,"Good service! Despite me attending at near closing hour of buffet, staff still assisted to help us order. Food were fresh and quickly prepared!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome Food,50,31 July 2017,Awesome as usual with my girlfriend last Friday 11.30 a.m. Decent variety of Japanese style food despite slow service.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Arrogant Attitude of Hostess,20,30 July 2017,The attitude of hostess was arrogant. I think that's because the business was too good. There's no personnel touch nor smile from her.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Deteriorated,20,30 July 2017,I've come here before. This time the sashimi was thin and wasn't presented as well. The skewers were a letdown - dry and lacking flavour. My only comfort is that we were using half-off vouchers
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome food!,40,30 July 2017,Awesome food as usual! Love their creamy salmon sashimi. And it's superb that you can order food by pieces!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",decent variety of japanese style food but could be a better experience,30,29 July 2017,"the place looks a bit crammed because of the way they arrange the tables and seats. order via tablet (which crashed a couple of times). sometimes they miss a few items in the order. called for service (via the tablet) but no staff came over. slowly in clearing dishes. sashimi quite fresh. other hot items are quite average. some came piping hot, some came a little cold. noisy on a weekday afternoon. stated last order at 2.15pm but staff came to remind us last order at 1.55pm."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service + staff very inflexible on birthday voucher,20,29 July 2017,I brought my gf to this place for her birthday. There was a one-for-one promotion for birthday month. Staff say we need voucher which needs to be done online. We asked if we can do on the spot. They were very inflexible on that.. the food took a long time to serve as well.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth it with 1-for-1!,40,28 July 2017,Service was very efficient and fast. Liked how each order of the rice rolls came in pairs so we were able to try more variety. Salmon and swordfish sashimi were fresh and good and especially liked the Dragonfly and Crunchy Makis! Great dining experience and extremely value for money with the wide variety available (:
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hassle free ordering,40,27 July 2017,"Food was alright, the tempura a little oily. Servers sent food to wrong tables. Had to place order twice before I got my food. Very convenient to order thru ipad. Saves the trouble of calling the waiter. Waiter did not understand that I wanted soya sauce to put the wasabi in. Gave me a whole dish of wasabi. Need more training. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very good,40,26 July 2017,The food is good and will definitely come back again. The place is a bit too dark to dine in and hard to snap a picture
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Buffet!,40,26 July 2017,"Great Buffet! Recommended to try! Staff were polite, friendly and attended to our request promply. The atmosphere was good, just that the table was a little small as it couldn't fit all our foods. But luckily the staff clear off fast! For location wise, it's a little inconvienence for me as I stay in the East."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful dining,40,26 July 2017,The service there was excellent. Not only that the food was fresh and delightful. Definitely do come here if your willing to try a variety of Japanese food.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Avg Jap Restaurant,30,25 July 2017,"Sashimi was really thick n fresh the first time, but far inferior in the subsequent round. Not properly defrosted, so the bite is not crunchy n fresh, but rather breaks apart n slightly mushy. The carbs are also quite badly done, turning dry n tough from the microwave reheating. The sushi n rolls are nice though."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast service but average food-wise,30,25 July 2017,"Service was extremely fast and servings were small, which was good as you can try as many food items as possible. However, apart from the fresh sashimi, the other food items were only average tasting in my opinion. Buffet does not come with complimentary water nor desserts"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A night at Shin Minori,30,23 July 2017,"I went with my wife for dinner at 21 July 2017 using the reservation service from Chope. This was our second visit to the restaurant for this year.1. Service was average to slightly above average. The restaurant was busy but staff were responsive. Most of the staff don't look too happy, except for the filipino waitress who was serving our area.2. Food was below average in general. Salmon sashimi was good as usual. Sushi was one of the winners, although I felt that the rice portion could have been reduced by 50%. The swordfish sashimi was not palatable - yes, this was the same as our first visit. Swordfish/Mekajiki is one of my favourite, hence I ordered it again, hoping that it would somehow it would be better this round - sigh! All other dishes were below average.3. Ambience - you almost have to be shouting to have a conversation. So don't expect too much.We had wanted to use our Entertainer app, but only realised that it was for lunch buffet when we arrived. Hence, we paid over $100 for 2 pax for the dinner.For this amount of money, I definitely can find something better. I suggest to go this place only if you are big fan of sushi, salmon sashimi and only if you have a 1 for 1 promotion coupon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Crowded during weekday lunch,30,23 July 2017,The restaurant seemed to be overwhelmed by the ala carte buffet's orders which came slow and understaff too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only for the Sashimi,30,22 July 2017,Originally intended to use the entertainer app during dinner hours but soon realised that the menu they offered are geared more for buffet. The Ala carte serving was too little to justify the app. Buffet was so so. Bland for most. Here for the sashimi.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",MUCH ABOUT NOT TOO MUCH !,30,21 July 2017,"I chose to dine at Shin Minori after reading an online review.The ambience was average and the seating cramp.Staff were well mannered but not too helpful. The supervisor (maybe captain or manager) made sure we knew her status because when I asked her for assistance, she would delegate a waiter or waitress to respond to me instead.The first 3 plates of sashimi were fresh but after that it was soft and warm.Other dishes were mostly served singular and in extremely small portions. It was frustrating to see the food served in this manner. They were like children's masak masak dishes! However, must say the salad was impressive... crisp and tasty dressing!My daughter had a cake after dinner and said it was small in portion and tasted below average.After our visit, my family members said it wasn't value for money and they'd prefer to eat elsewhere.    "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fresh sashimi,40,19 July 2017,"had the ala carte buffet dinner. there was a good enough variety for sashimi, grilled and fried items. too bad, desserts are not included in buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummilicious Jap Food,40,18 July 2017,"If you will like to enjoy a satisfying and legit Japanese food, Shin Minori is the right place. Went for their lunch buffet. Definitely worth every cents and calories. One of the best Sashimi (Salmon and Swordfish) in town and I am always spoilt for choices for their selection of maki. Oh yeah, they serve one of the best Pumpkin Chawamushi which is a MUST try. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't feel welcomed.,10,15 July 2017,". i had been to this restaurant 2 times & I always had a good impression. But this time round I simply feel like I am not welcomed. i had made reservation for 1.30pm. last order is at 2pm, & closes at 2.30pm. when I reach at 1.45pm, your staff said last order in 8mins? Ok fine, I agreed & walked in with the lady. While the lady was showing me to the table, she commented ""why can't you come another day? "" ""why don't I come another day""? Fine I won't come again. The price of your buffet is not cheap & this is the kind of customer service you are giving. Please reflect on your service. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Food & Service,40,15 July 2017,Have dined a couple of times. A varieties of food. Have to pay for drinks but still reasonable.

Food choice was alright with a mix of sashimi / sushi and yakitori / grilled items. Generally portions were ok but food quality was really average. The sashimi didnt taste particularly fresh and it was hard to finish some of the items.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good,40,8 July 2017,"Sashimi was good, better than the grilled fare. Service was alright, ambience was nice. Packed during the weekend."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",birthday lunch on a weekday,40,7 July 2017,birthday voucher redemption was a breeze for my hubby's birthday which falls on a weekday. Food was served very fast upon ordering. Food standard is still as good. Worthwhile the price for their buffet.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,30,5 July 2017,"Extensive selection available for the buffet lunch. Can try lots of items as single serving is usually one pc. Sashimi are fresh. Overall food are not bad. Do note that the buffet does not include drinks. However, the attitude of the waitresses and waiters, especially one of the waitresses, really need lots of improvement. When I told one waitress that they gave me a bowl of rice which i didn't order, she keeps repeating its ""Gohan"" and insisted that i had ordered it before turning her back and walk away. I need to get their attention again (as i really do not want to eat a bowl of rice!) and this particular waitress walk to my table with her sullen face, upon checking my order list, realized that she had made a mistake, just took the rice away, turn her back and walk off without apologizing. Plain rude!!! In fact they had orders mixed up several time. Most of the time, the waitresses and waiters are standing there talking loudly without any regards to the customers around them."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food and Service,50,5 July 2017,"Visited the restaurant with the birthday month voucher. Food is ordered through the computer system. They are served fast and hot. As it was a weekday, it was less crowded than expected. Good quality food and is value for money as we (two of us) only paid for one diner."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service,20,5 July 2017,"Waited very long for food to be served. Slow service the moment it got crowded. Had to cancel all remaining orders as the wait was too long! Sat at a corner with wooden panels as surrounding, the wooden panels were mouldy and dirty."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant ar UE,10,3 July 2017,"I patronised this restaurant on 28th May Sunday together with four of my friends for lunch buffet. It was our 1st visit, the experience is bad. Waiter & waitress include cashier ' atttiude is terrible. No customer's sense. It is not that they are shortage of staff, they simply has no initiative, no customer's focus.We have to request several times to refill our cups. We have to walk to counter to pay the bill & queue while the waiter & cashier continue with their chit chatting. After payment, no acknowledgement no thank you. Never expect such lousy service & attitude in this Japanese restaurant, no matter how goood the food is, poor service will put customer off. The past rating of excellence is in the past. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent quality of food and service,50,29 June 2017,Excellent quality of food which is fresh. The sashimi melts in the mouth for to its freshness. Staff are also courteous.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",1 for 1 Buffet Lunch Birthday treat.,50,29 June 2017,"No gimmicks! I redeemed the birthday voucher advertised at Facebook.
The food were served fresh and right temperature.
Had a great and full lunch at Shin Minori on my birthday!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday lunch at shin minori,50,29 June 2017,Booking was confirm with ease using Chope app. Food was ordered thru tablet menu. Service was very prompt. Food served was in excellent quality.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent quality of shashimi,50,28 June 2017,"Lots of variety of Japanese food, ordered through a tablet. Shashimi was delicious, and there's a wide range of Japanese food. Tepanyaki take quite long to come, as there is clearly a shortage of staff."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Rush,20,28 June 2017,"the shop closes at 10pm, last order at 9.30pm. we made reservation for 8.15pm which is the earliest time slot possible for online booking so not left much time to really enjoy (we ordered the buffet btw, this is BEFORE they told us the last order time). everything was frantic and rushing to order as much as we could then at 9.45pm they started to shut down everything. Although they didn't tell us to leave but we got the idea. Its one of the worst experience we ever had in this type of restaurant. about half of the choices of sashimi has a bit of sour taste, might be due to exposed to room temperature for too long, all the cooked food was covered in MSG, u WILL get very thirsty and have to BUY more drinks even if u are having buffet (yes, it's pathetic, its supposed to be all u can eat but not all u can drink, even tea is not FOC). Do NOT come here no matter what."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One of the best,40,28 June 2017,"If there's any place I religiously frequent for fresh sashimi it's Shin Minori. I have been visiting this eatery for over 2 years, and it's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants that stick to their standards. Never once had I eaten a badly prepared dish. I have taken a counter seat before and seen the chefs work their crafts. Very dedicated individuals. But like every other no one place is perfect. I think their customer service (from the waiters / waitresses) leaves much to be desired, often not getting the correct orders, and rather clumsy. Their ordering system (the use of mobile devices) is not very fluid either, having experienced network failure and app crashes occasionally. That being said, still quite worth the buck if you are on the Mission to find good sashimi. Rest of the food is good too. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Taste of food and the service provided,10,27 June 2017,"Variety of food - satisfactoryTaste of food - below averageCustomer service - horrendousThe waiters and waitresses were making loud and weird noises, like woofing or barking noises. And we closed the tatami room doors and they opened it again and showed us black face. Like they are very frustrated as they have to wait for us to finish our food. They have to get this right - it's a buffet!!!!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,40,27 June 2017,"The food was excellent. With the self ordering system, it was much easier to manage the ordering and the food was served fast. The dessert and drink were not included in the buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Value!,40,27 June 2017,"Good variety and the sashimi was wonderfully fresh and succulent! Great value for money! Only letdown was the online ordering system as it did not capture our initial order though a message prompting 'order sent' was seen. We were left waiting for quite a while and upon checking with one of the staff, was told that they did not receive the order and we had to key in our orders again. Also, our request for refill of our plain water was left attended and we had to request again. In the end, one staff just came and left a tumbler of water on our table."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",What you get is what you pay for,30,27 June 2017,"The cuts can be better. The taste is average. It was quiet on a Saturday during lunch time, so this is not a bad place to bring children."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner,50,26 June 2017,"Feels the same since we came in 2012. Definitely much improved order taking system which is fully automated!
Food definitely improved!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Environment,50,26 June 2017,It's very pleasure to have a small gather with my friends when public holiday and the environment was the just too cozy to enjoy our meals.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,30,26 June 2017,"Decent food but not the most memorable japanese buffet in Singapore. The portion sizes for the hot food were huge, which was rather odd given that this is an ala carte buffet. Service was extremely quick and waitresses were generally very helpful."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummy!,50,25 June 2017,Love the food fresh sashimi n othernvarieties. Its been uncountable times since i return to this place. This time i brought6 friends along. All had gd review!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The ambience is good but the people working these were busy chatting among themselves. Service was below expectation.,20,24 June 2017,"Even the Chef preparing food there were chatting away without any mask on, hence is rather unhygienic? Was there a few years back , the service was far better than now."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great variety and worth the money,40,24 June 2017,"Came for the a la carte buffet. Lots of items on the menu to choose from, although unlikely to sample them all. Casual and comfortable atmosphere too.I liked the quail egg alot and their chicken was done well. The sashimi was a bit of a let down as the swordfish was slightly hard, not very sure why. If I had more lunch time I would definitely want to try other portions of the menu."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner,40,23 June 2017,This place never fail to delight with their wide menu selection and super fast service. Go for the ala-carte buffet and eat till your fill. The portion served are reasonable and the quality of the dishes are good. Really good value for money.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice sashimi,30,21 June 2017,"I read a review on this restaurant so naturally I had my expectations/hopes up. The sashimi was nice and fresh but the items fell below expectation. Thankfully I had the birthday voucher, otherwise I would feel it was not worth the money per pax. I was given a $10 voucher for the next visit but I doubt I will return."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Celebrated Father's Day,50,20 June 2017,"Sashimi was fresh. Enjoyed the variety too. Though busy, staff
were polite and tried their best to tend to our requests. Enjoyed our dining experience there. :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good spread variety,30,20 June 2017,The variety is huge with good range of raw and cooked food. Overall the quality of food is quite good. However I was disappointed the buffet does not come with drink and dessert.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Dining Experience,40,19 June 2017,The service standard can be improved; some members of the service crew could have been more warm instead of just going about with their jobs. It is a Japanese restaurant after all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A great lunch,50,19 June 2017,"Great location and the food was very nice. Service was fast and pleasant too!
It was a great place to enjoy a super nice lunch and to talk business which we did. I would definately recommend this place to others!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide range of food,40,17 June 2017,It was actually my second time eating their buffet and I still enjoyed it! However it was more crowded so maybe service was a little slow and sometimes they forgot our requests. But food was still served hot and would definitely return!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",good japanese buffeT,40,17 June 2017,"good and attentive service! loved the food there, some hits and misses, but was quite worth it :)
will come bk again"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Was slight disappointed,30,16 June 2017,"Went there with friends for a birthday celebration, had high expectations as we read some good reviews and it was our first time there. The food was average, some of the sashimi were cut into uneven thickness, the fish also wasn't very fresh. The service was slow but understandable as the place was filled. Price is abit steep for the quality of service and food that was provided."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Surprisingly Fast & Tasty,40,15 June 2017,1st time trying this restaurant. Food & price reasonable. Speed to service was very good especially for buffets.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Surprisingly good sashimi,30,15 June 2017,Good sashimi quality for the price but that's it. Everything else was average. So just order the sashimi if that's your thing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A pretty big disappointment,20,14 June 2017,"I was very disappointed at the very least. Fresh sashimi was what attracted me to the buffet but it certainly wasn't very fresh. The tuna was fishy and the other sashimi was average at best. The cooked food and grilled items, I didn't even order twice and I usually really love grilled items. The best items were the chawanmushi (very silky) and the mini soft shell crabs. Went there on a 1 for 1 special deal but wouldn't go for a similar offer."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great varieties with good quality of food serve.,50,14 June 2017,"Service is ok, not very slow, food taste 👍🏻. Great varieties . Definitely worth the money.

Most of the dishes are very tasty, the sashimi are pretty fresh. Would definitely be back for more.My only qualm is the small confined seating space for two. If you are of a Bigger built, you will get really uncomfortable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",My Birthday Celebration,40,14 June 2017,Overall is good and clean. Food are served quite fast! Staff are friendly and polite too. Will return back again for gathering and lunch or dinner buffet!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide Variety,40,13 June 2017,Impressed with the wide variety of choices at their ala carte buffet. Glad that they serve single portions as well to reduce food wastage yet allow one to taste as many dishes as possible! Service was very prompt too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Repeated customer over and over again,50,12 June 2017,"Shin minori never fail me in terms of food quality and service.
With the new dish introduced, it gives the menu even more choice and makes me want to come more !"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant Buffet Lunch,40,11 June 2017,The sashimi was fresh and food was served promptly. There is a quite a wide selection of food items as well. But the sofa seating placement may be too near to each other with other guests.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good!!,40,11 June 2017,Food was good and fresh. Staff were attentive to arriving guests. Food was good - really recommend the fresh sashimi!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre food,30,9 June 2017,Mediocre food but there was birthday month promotion. It costs about 50++ for 2 person with the promotion. They charge for green tea separately too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quality of food is good with a wide range of uncooked and Cooked food.,40,8 June 2017,Quality of food is good with a wide range of uncooked and Cooked food. However location is out of the way and a long walk from Clark Quay mrt station.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh,40,8 June 2017,Food was fresh and varieties of food was great! Space was abit small though. Atmosphere was very cozy but tables are quite near to one another.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety of food,40,6 June 2017,"Location is not the most accessible, but the food standard is good. There were also a wide variety of food on the buffet menu. It was my second visit and the standard is quite consistent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Recent visit,30,3 June 2017,"The tablet to order food keep hanging a few times. Thankfully the waiter agree to take our order. When I rang to book, they told me there still 1-1 promotion for lunch using UOB. I wrote remarks on my online booking after my call, they should call me to explain if the promotion has ended before the actual dining date. We ended up paying for 4, 1 free. Promotions should be listed on website so it's clear. A bit disappointed "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Non alcoholic drinks chargeable and no dessert,30,3 June 2017,All drinks are chargeable includes non alcoholic drinks and there is no dessert or fruits too. Ika sashimi cut too thick.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,30,2 June 2017,food is average and seafood is not very fresh. Staff were friendly though and the general ambiance is cozy.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious Varieties of Japanese Food!,40,1 June 2017,"The place is clean and tidy.
Tons of different food to choose from.
All of them are delicious to boot!
but the tablet of which to order the menu from often crashed :("
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",food was so so,20,31 May 2017,"Went on my actual birthday, because they have birthday offer with min 2 person going. We went for lunch buffet, with sashimi, yakitori, soup, side dishes, and rice noodles. Their portion is very very small, and a bit salty for yakitori. Expect for salmon sashimi, I don't think anything that I've ordered was nice. Ended up, my friend paid more than 40 for that meal, even they gave us a 10 dollar voucher, but I will never want to visit this restaurant again for below average food. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,30,28 May 2017,The food standard dropped since the last we went last year. The service of the staff was also not up to standard.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good placw ro chill and eat,50,26 May 2017,Nice ambience and the food menu was fantastic. There a magician that entertain us while we having our meal. Overall its a good place to wind down n chill over good food n drinks
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,50,26 May 2017,Not our first time. Food was very tasty. Sashimi was very fresh. Alcohol was good. There was a magician going table to table on the fast we went. He was great as well. Will be back.

There is enough items on the menu for kids!
Generally satisfied and service is OK!
Will definitely be back!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday treat 2017,40,26 May 2017,"As a show of appreciation for customers patronage, they're treating birthday celebrants to ala carte buffet lunch within their birthday month accompanied by at least one paying companion. And what a treat it was! You choose & tap your desired dishes from a tablet and with just a short wait after sending your order, food is served. Want more? Then tap tap tap again. As long as you don't waste food. Service was quick. The food quality was very good with really fresh sashimi & other ingredients. Beautifully plated. One improvement needed though is to train the staff to be more hospitable. It's fine even if they do not smile for as long as they do not sulk as well hehe. Anyway, why are they looking sullen? Maybe they need some positive incentives. Just saying. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",1 for 1 birthday treat,50,25 May 2017,Fresh sashimi and awesome sushi! Rest of the items are nice as well. Worth especially since it is 1 for 1.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese food craving satisfied!,50,25 May 2017,There's a great promotion during the birthday month and the food was really good! service was really good too :)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent food,50,25 May 2017,This is our go-to place for japanese buffet as they make sure to be consistent in the quality of food despite it being a buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place for kids,30,24 May 2017,"I was not blown away by this place... but it was convenient and close to our hotel...
It was fine as a fast and good solution..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not up to expectations,20,24 May 2017,"Inflexible iPad ordering device, difficult to use because it was fixed on to the wall. No wifi - although the signal is strong but it was not available to diners. Sashimi was not fresh, just edible. other dishes are mostly average in taste. Tight table arrangements. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Birthday Treat!,40,24 May 2017,"The only thing missing was the inclusion of non-alcoholic drinks & a dessert in the Buffet price. However, that way, at least we got to sample even more of the lovely variety of items available.😊"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent sashimi and maki,50,24 May 2017,The sashimi was cut very evenly and the texture of the fishes were unreal. I loved how fresh all the fish tasted. The grilled alacarte dishes were very delicious too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent japanese a la carte buffet,50,24 May 2017,"Really recommended! The sashimi is fresh, the food selection are wide. And very tasty! I will recommend this to my friends."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hungry and angry,10,23 May 2017,"Came around 9pm with 2 friends and started to order a few dishes. We knew we could order more later so we didn't order too much. And around 9:30pm a waiter came to us to tell us it was time to make the last order. So we did and order all what we expected to eat at once. Dishes started to come and then it stopped. So we asked the waiter where were the pending items. He replied that there was nothing else. We ended up with a bill of 150 sgd for 3 (no drinks) for 5 makis/sushis each. Well, that makes the most expensive sushi I ever had..The worst is that they asked us to pay before we discovered that they cancelled most of our order. And there was no refund possible - even if one of my friend had only one miso soup. The manager even told me that I will have a rebate next time but she didn't even write my name - that's just cynicism.About the food, don't expect too much. It's a Buffet so you won't get the best fish nor the best part of it. They were out of stock of their premium fatty salmon. The sashimis slices were so thick that they were hardly eatable.Definitely one of my worst sushi experience in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best jap buffet!,50,23 May 2017,"Trust me when I say I am an avid jap buffet fan. Visited most of the popular jap buffets in singapore and I always find myself coming back to Shin Minori. I love the really great variety of food Shin Minori has to offer and also the freshness of their sashimi and really quick service! They have never missed out a single item on our order as everything was really systematic. In most other japanese buffet restaurants, you have to manually order with the waiter while at SM, you simply order through the ipad reserved for each table. My most recent visit was in May 2017 and I must say I am pleasantly surprised the quality and standard of their food has remained the same (or even better now) compared to my last visit in 2016. I had to ask for several things during the meal such as an extra pair of chopstick and wasabi and despite it being a busy friday dinner time, the staff got me my stuff under less than 5 minutes. Their service here is simply the best!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Quick Service, Good Food",40,23 May 2017,"My 4th time dining at Shin Minori. Had a birthday voucher to redeem which was equivalent to a 1-for-1 deal - very value for money. Buffet menu was extensive with a lot of variety to choose from. Was impressed with the improved service as compared to what I had experienced in my previous visits. Seemed to have more service staff now too. They were attentive and had good initiative. Prompt to serve up dishes, clear empty plates from our table and refill our glasses. Food was fresh. Overall standard was good. Only gripe was that quite a number of dishes (esp. the fried and grilled ones) were under-seasoned and therefore tasted quite bland which was fine as it just meant we were consuming less sodium - healthier! Will definitely be back whenever the sashimi craving kicks in."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food!,50,22 May 2017,Food was great. It is my 2nd time there for their buffet. Love their sashimi platter! Would definitely go there again in future.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,50,22 May 2017,Food excellent as always. All is perfect. Except one order of mine (grilled wings) were forgotten . :(
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service needs improvements,30,22 May 2017,"Food was good. only thing was the service. the staffs took a few wrong orders from our table without telling us. And I realized when we ordered something from the staffs, they don't reply anything... zzzzzzz"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Better value the bigger the appetite,40,22 May 2017,Good deal but a complicated system of ordering too often fails but the food is nice and if you choose well and estimate well it is a lot of food/ sushi and other normally expensive items for good value
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good selection of food choices for buffet,40,21 May 2017,"Good for sashimi lovers who go for the buffet, good range of choices for the buffet. Would be perfect if certain dessert and green tea included in the buffet menu."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not bad,40,21 May 2017,Not bad. Food was fresh. Been there a few times. Overall satisfied with food and service. Slightly pricey.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cooked salmon was not fresh,20,21 May 2017,"We went there on a fri night, restaurant was busy and they were probably under staffed. Variety and sashimi was ok. I also had the cooked salmon with egg gravy, which my friend tried a little- she did mention it tasted not fresh but I ate it all. 30mins after we left, I vomited out all the cooked salmon and eggs. Imo, the raw stuff are ok.. but the meat they use for their cooked food varieties might not be that fresh (they might feel they are cooking it anyway to kill the bateria) Bad first experience and wil not go back."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday treats,50,19 May 2017,The food served were fresh and the service was very good. The place is nice and staffs were friendly. Will recommend visiting this place.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nothing fantastic ,30,18 May 2017,"I suppose it's attempting to follow a very autonomous serving idea, but we prefer a little more service. Walking into the restaurant, a server motioned us over to a table, we sat down and didn't get a single acknowledgment afterwards. All food and drinks were ordered on an iPad, and once prepared, dropped off without a word again. Food was decent, but not enough to make me want to go back."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, wide selection",50,18 May 2017,"Wide selection of both cooked Japanese and raw (Sushi/sashimi) offerings. The seaweed salad is a must try. Me and my friend had double helpings, he had triple."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",love the food though service is kinda slow for one part,50,18 May 2017,"Please have more discounts so I can bring more people! :D thanks for your hard work though, there were a few people so you had to make sure you were fast"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service,30,18 May 2017,Staffs do not bother to welcome us to the restaurant and even when we are leaving after making the payment. Their service is really bad.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi and various Japanese food,30,18 May 2017,"Sashimi was great! We ordered three plates by the end of our dinner. Various other items ok - cold ramen, edamame, sushi, chawinmushi. Service was quick. It's quite pricey for an average place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mother's Day Dinner,50,17 May 2017,Service was polite and efficient. Food was good. The dining party enjoyed all the dishes ordered and we have decided to make this restaurant our go-to Japanese Ala carte buffet resto. Says a lot since we live in the Northeast and our weekly Japanese go-to wAs in the East.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cozy,40,17 May 2017,"Other than the onigiri, everything else is nice. Would recommend others to come and try at least once for their buffet. The only drawback is that the price doesn't include drinks or dessert. It would be perfect if both of that are included in the menu buffet. The staff were helpful and food came out fast. Perfect place for japanese buffet once in a while."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food!,50,17 May 2017,"Loved the sashimi offered at the restaurant, but will not recommend any of their beef dishes. $39.90++ for a lunch buffet, worth it!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality food,50,17 May 2017,This place has never fail to disappoint me. The standard of the sashimi and cooked food (e.g bean sprouts) has maintained over the years.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unsatisfied Dining Exoerience,10,16 May 2017,Food is too salty!! Food ordering system is slow. Service is slow! Location isn't ideal although parking is easy!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place to have a team lunch,50,15 May 2017,"Came in for team lunch and lunch service was excellent (similar to dinner which i had awhile back). Only issue is that serving sizes can be erratic, some of the food was served in way too huge portions for the amount we ordered (not sure if it was my colleagues fault for ordering too much). Overall tasty food and good service at a reasonable price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,20,15 May 2017,"Food was not as good, service as well... My whole family wasnt expected it to be like this and they are very unsatisfying with it... Funny thing was: if the restaurant's last order was 2pm... den it should inform us earlier when we booked or stated at the website or voucher... so that we will not book the timing for 2pm... "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Consistent,30,14 May 2017,"Back after many years, quality and standard remains consistent. Good value for money with decent diverse selection. Service was below par (many wait staff were unable to speak English)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",delicious,50,13 May 2017,"really enjoyed the spread at shin miori.
although it would have been better if we could get more ipads for ordering.
but food was on point."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,30,12 May 2017,"Did not have very high expectation for this place due to all the bad reviews that I have came across. However, after dining there, realized it's not that bad? Service was ok, food was good. Value for money actually."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori,40,10 May 2017,Huge selection but undeniably average. Ordering tablets need more improvement in its connectivity. Standard sashimi spread with a small selection of skewers and bbq.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at restaurant,30,10 May 2017,Chope was easy to use but the food is normal tasting only. Ambience is okay but the table is abit small to put all buffet stuff
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable great tasting Japanese dinner,50,9 May 2017,"Many varieties of Japanese food to titillate the taste buds, fresh especially sushi sashimi, orders were accurate, food was tasty and service was reasonably fast. Reservation is a need"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent buffet,40,8 May 2017,Very good variety of food and good quality. Food was delicious as always and good sake recommendation by the female manager.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet lunch at shin minori,50,8 May 2017,Decide to have sashimi few days before the actual day. Used the Chope app and easily booked a reservation using the app. We were served promptly at the restaurant. Wait time for food was decent despite the restaurant was packed. The only problem we faced was the tablet that was used to order food keep hanging. Have to restart the app many times. The food list we ordered went missing a few time and we have to choose again. Hope they can solve the app issues. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi quality,40,8 May 2017,"The sashimi was fresh and tasted really good. Many selections of food which was great.
However, drinks were not included in the buffet (not even plain water) despite the buffet was almost $50/pax (after taxes)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice good and service,40,8 May 2017,It was crowded for a weekday lunch. I like that the food comes piping hot and the sashimi was fresh. And they serve swordfish sashimi too which many places do not serve for buffet. Dessert cake was a disappointment though as it was served frozen.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below average quality,20,7 May 2017,"I booked dinner and paid about $106 for Jap buffet for 2pax. Firstly service was quite slow, given the fully packed restaurant. The cooked food was very average, and we didn't order more than we usually would have. The portions of cooked food was a little off, some came in just one piece, but some was too big a portion even for 2 pax, just like the kimichi bean sprouts dish. The sashimi was thickly sliced and seemed to be out of the fridge for awhile. But to be fair, it wasn't not fresh, but definitely not my idea of fresh sashimi just out from the fridge. We had 2 wrong orders given amidst the overwhelming crowd. Overall okay experience, but will not return for awhile. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good as always :-),50,7 May 2017,good service but food was served rather slower than usual but maybe because it was full house :-) sashimi was not as fresh as before for this visit but will come back again!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,40,6 May 2017,Good spread for buffet. Sashimi was fresh and generous. Food quality above average.Really enjoyed our dinner there
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore", Catch up session with friends,50,4 May 2017,It's definitely a great place to dine in with friends or family. Unexpectedly fresh sashimi served. Love the perfect grilled yakitori especially the garlic pork skewer and shiitake mushroom! Tempura were fried just perfect and dip together with the sauce. Highly recommend to other people for celebrating occasions like birthday or family and friends gathering. For sure I'll visit Shin Minori Restaurant again! 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala-Carte Buffet Lunch,40,4 May 2017,"Went there with my husband and my kids using Facebook Birthday 1-for-1 promo.Children below 5 years old can dine free there! :)Food is good, fresh and servings are just nice.Personally recommend their yakimono and pumpkin chawanmushiTheir sashimi is very fresh, esp Tuna and Salmon belly!Currently they have other on-going promotions, so do check out their Facebook/website for more information.Will definitely go back again :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great but needs to improve,40,3 May 2017,"It's perfect for every occasion from birthday celebrations, farewells to festivities, or no special day actually but you just need a good food at a great price! Lovely place for yakitori & sashimi especially. Needs to work on their ordering&serving though. Ive patronised them at least once every two months and their ordering system either hangs or the order was submitted but kitchen didnt receive it. Also, once the order is sent, it doesnt get recorded on the list, so no way to track your orders. Just 2 days ago, we ended up waiting 20mins for an order which we eventually got them to check with the kitchen but they insisted there werent any orders left for the table - and we had no way to prove. I'll bring a pen and paper next time to track my orders, but I'll return for sure. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty Average Food,30,2 May 2017,"Went there with great expectations after seeing the place win some awards on reservation sites, went away feeling underwhelmed.Many of the dishes tried were average at best, and lack even the closeness to japanese food flavours one can regularly find at places like Keyaki, or even at Chako and Hakata (previously at Hong Leong Gardens).For eg. Chicken teppan came pretty hard to chew and had a gooey sweet taste to it, which was quite odd; Ebi tempura came rather limp and bland while the accompanying dip was tasteless, unlike the very light but aromatic dip, one usually would expect. Gyuniku Shogayaki was good, though the flavour resembles more a cze char dish than a japanese itamemonoThe sashimi were good, clean and fresh tasting, so are the sushi and temaki. Well-made, standard fares, so those would be the standouts in the restaurant.Entertainer app can be used for PH eve, however some of the staff were unaware of this, but eventually the correct processing was done, so customer may need to be more in tune with the promotions on offer instead of relying only on the service crew.Pretty packed on a noisy Saturday afternoon, so no ambience to speak of.For the sheer variety, the price is very decent at $40++"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi day!,30,2 May 2017,Nothing spectacular especially the drinks pricing make up for the discounts they give for the foods.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible attitudes,10,2 May 2017,"Horrible attitudes of staff and even the branch manager. Refused to let us change table even though 90% of the tables were not used for the rest of the evening. When asked what buffet includes, service staff says ""Everything"" but in fact it only includes what is listed under buffet tab. when asking the female branch manager(?) questions, she wasn't even facing us when she answered, and worse, answered in an agitated tone. Honestly worst experience ever in a restaurant. Felt like a kopitiam standard."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not bad,40,1 May 2017,"Sashimi is fresh and the service was prompt. Cooked dishes were okay. No wastage charges and no time limit for the buffet, making this a value for money choice."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,30,1 May 2017,"Second time visiting the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff was very busy during the lunch buffet and did not manage to attend to us calling them for help. It took a while for the staff to respond. Otherwise, the food was of reasonable quality for the price paid and it had a good ambience as well. Will consider returning to this place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,30,1 May 2017,Good service. Food selection was average. Sashimi quality wasn't very good. The cold Soba was tasteless.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ambience & service,50,30 April 2017,Ambience is good and service is timely. Staff serve with timeliness and with a smile. Food quality is fresh and good
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Expensive, slow service, and poor quality of food",10,30 April 2017,"The price is overly pricey for the quality of food they serve. On top of that, even though it's a buffet, you got to wait for them to serve you. Waiting time for the dishes is very very long. For $40 per pax, it's really not worth your money and time visiting this place. This is an honest review. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome food,40,29 April 2017,I love their sashimi! It's fresh and tasty. And their grilled salmon is delicious Too! However it would be more awesome if their drinks is included in the buffet. Overall it's awesome!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality,40,29 April 2017,Premium buffet standard since the menu is ala carte so all the food is prepared when you order it. But be prepared to wait a while for the food to arrive.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet,40,29 April 2017,"Food was good but service was abit slow probably due to the restaurant being super packed. Buffet was not the self-service kind but we had to order from an iPad then they would serve us but the food took really long to come. Nonetheless, still alot of variety to choose from!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great experience,50,27 April 2017,"Had the Japanese a la carte buffet. Sashimi was fresh, good selection of food to choose from, prompt service. Only wish the lighting there was better as it was too dark for my liking."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good,40,26 April 2017,Most of the food are not bad. Sashimi are cold enough. The staff cleared the plate very fast after you finish eating.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety in buffet selection,40,25 April 2017,I was pleased with the selection n quality but the service of one of the staff was bad on both times i went. He was in all black so i presume he would be a supervisor but his attitude when he served was terrible.. clanging the plates on our table and rushing to clear our plates when we still had food!!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Foods are good but order is a little too slow,40,24 April 2017,"Foods are good but order is a little too slow.
Moreover, some order was not serve unless re-order and that menu come in double."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",awesome dinner buffet spread,40,24 April 2017,"enjoyed the buffet dinner, especially the fresh spread of sashimi . the cooked food like yakitori items , special sushi rolls are highly recommended as well"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable buffet,30,24 April 2017,"We (family/relatives) decided to try this place out for my birthday. Since we had 10 or 11 people, they gave us a private room. Since this was an ala carte buffet, ordering was done through a tablet. We had to ask for another tablet as 11 people sharing 1 tablet was just ridiculous. Drinks are not included in the buffet, so take note. Service was quite slow. Some of the items we ordered took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Though the buffet was extremely affordable (considering it was serving Japanese cuisine and it was a dinner buffet), the quality of the dishes were not up to standard. The sashimi was relatively fresh. The salmon handroll I ordered was pathetic, there was only a small piece of salmon inside the handroll. (as shown in the photo) The spring rolls were super thin.Overall, I would not recommend coming here if you are picky about the quality of food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant - April 2017 visit,30,24 April 2017,"Food was ok. But there was a big group of student booking making the place like market area, my friends and I cannot even talk or hear clearly."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese buffet around,40,22 April 2017,"We had gone for the lunch buffet. Reservations were a breeze with the Chope app. The place was easy to find and we were settled pretty quickly to our seats. Ordering was via a tablet. The quality of food was very good and fresh. However, one of our last orders never made it to our table but that was fine since we were too stuffed by then..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't go. Period.,10,18 April 2017,"Bad food, bad service, terrible coordination between delivery orders and live orders. Waiters did not speak English."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very Big slices of sashimi,40,17 April 2017,"The slices of sashimi were very generous, and the tsukune meat balls, asparagus bacon, gyuniku shogayaki are recommended. Please do go try them yourself."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,30,14 April 2017,"Drinks not inclusive, per pax is $45 after all the miscellaneous charges, not worth for the limited variety of food choices available for buffet. Food not as fantastic as reviewed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really good Japanese buffet,50,14 April 2017,"Tucked away inside UE Mall, you could miss this place if you didn't know about it. You have to reserve a table as the place gets really busy. For around S$47 you get a buffet choice of over 100 items! This is incredible value and you can order as much as you can. Desserts are charged separately. The food items are made to order, so you don't pick from a stale buffet table. You order on their tablet and very swiftly the food will start to arrive. We're not fans of cold tofu, so that item was a miss for us. But everything else was really good. I was actually really surprised at the price because this is a quality restaurant in a nice location, service is impeccable and the food delicious. A must try for any fans of Japanese food. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Alright for the price. Food is fresh, ambience so so",40,14 April 2017,"Alright for the price. 1 for 1 due to birthday voucher. Food is fresh, the variety is there, ambience so so. Staff v cold, could put on a smile"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-money Japanese buffet,40,10 April 2017,"We had buffet at Shin Minori on April 8, to take advantage of the OCBC three-for-one promotion. It was very good, as usual, though we enjoyed our visit three weeks earlier more. That could be because we had not had sushi/sashimi for a long time. The sashimi was very fresh and we enjoyed the moriwase before we restricted ourselves to salmon and octopus. The salmon was well marbled, but we did not manage to get a morsel of the salmon belly on our second visit (maybe that was why we enjoyed our first visit more!!). Looking forward to our next visit, but after a time lapse, of course. Meanwhile, we cannot wait to eat Gayatri's (Race Course Road) yummy fish-head curry!!! I usually tarpow."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Missing food,30,9 April 2017,Food was not bad but some of our orders didn't come. The waiter also mixed up our orders with the table beside. We had to exchange our food after relizing our food went to next table and theirs are on our table. The place is quite cramp. Wouldn't come back if there's no promo as it's quite pricey. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious!,50,9 April 2017,There is a wide variety of food. Service is fast in serving the food and they are fresh and delicious too!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh swordfish,30,9 April 2017,"For sashimi, the swordfish and salmon were good. The cuts were too thick. The tuna was inedible cos it was about an inch thick. Rest of menu was okay. The tempura batter a bit thick."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with entertainment,50,7 April 2017,"We had a good time during the aka carte buffet. Since it's their 10th anniversary, they had a magician performing at our desk. Wonderful! Loved the magic show... we had a great time"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fantastic food, great service",50,5 April 2017,We loved it! The fish was fresh and the kimchi beansprout noodle dish (whose name is escaping me) was out of this world. Service was prompt and friendly. Bought a Chope voucher so I saved 10%!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",good food,50,4 April 2017,Most worthwhile place to have great sashimi buffet. We went with 6 pax. All enjoyed the food. Highly recommended

Used entertainer app for 1 for 1 however cashier missed out and charged the original price until we pointed out to them."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CAN BE BETTER,30,3 April 2017,"Celebrated my friend birthday there last week. The birthday girl commented the 1st & 2nd batch of sashimi served is with different quality and she is quite dissappointed. Seated near to the live kitchen so the conversation, giggling and comments between kitchen & service staff can be annoying and disturbing. Overall, the whole experience is still good and i look forward to see more improvement in future..... so GAMBATTE!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",2nd Visit And Still Great,40,2 April 2017,"My 2nd time here.This place is quite hard to get to from train station. But I prefer to walk from Clarke Quay MRT station which will probably take about 15 mins walk. For tourist best is just to take a taxi, grab car or Uber. Location is at UE Square. Food generally are good. But do expect some waiting time during weekends as usually it will be packed with diners. Best to make reservations to avoid disappointment. Service staffs are friendly. So far so good. Price for buffet is at about SGD 50. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reservation Received with Accuracy,50,2 April 2017,Reservation was confirmed with several automated calls. This should be complemented with email confirmation as the calls were sometimes made at times that I was unavailable
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food and service, but staff appeared overwhelmed by manpower shortage",40,2 April 2017,"Good food and service, but staff appeared overwhelmed by the manpower shortage. Frequency of receiving out orders was also a little inconsistent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth the money,20,2 April 2017,"Went there with birthday 1for1 promo. Since it's ala-cart buffet, we need to wait till they serve us our order. Table was too small, orders came in quite slow, plates were not cleared until we asked them to. The food quality was not bad, but it's only worth it because it's 1-for-1. for full price $44, will never go back again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average Food, Bad Service, Not value for money",10,1 April 2017,"Bad service: Food took an extremely long time to arrive on our table for the very little amount of food we have ordered. When we need someone to attend to us to refill our tea pot, we have to press more than 6 times on the tablet and no one attended to us. We have to go to the service staff directly (none was around our section) to get it refilled. Food: Sashimi was fresh and good. Yakitori are too hard/tough for comfortable chewing. The serving were miserable. We ordered bacon wrapped with asparagus and the serving is so small. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food Good Service,50,1 April 2017,The food is delicious and they have a wide selections for their buffet. Their service is fast too. Will go back again!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Sashimi Quality but super slow service,30,31 March 2017,"Food service was slow. Had to do multiple reminders to service staff for my hand rolls but it wasn't served at all. On the bright side, Sashimi cut was fresh and thick. Their grilled spread was good. Their crab croquette was nice. Point is their food was good but due to the slow service, we couldn't eat much and got tired of waiting. And once it hit 230pm, food service stopped. Surprisingly, the table on our right had all their orders even though they arrive later than us. The table on our left was surprised that table had all their orders fulfilled without any glitches yet we were left hanging on several dishes and had to remind the service staff again and again. There were guests being placed in partitioned tables with a board like in a library. Probably won't go back again during lunch time due to their lack of service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent ala carte buffet,40,31 March 2017,Went for alacarte buffet lunch. Food quality was decent. Sashimi was fresh. You order through an iPad so it's very convenient and no need to worry about bothering the wait staff excessively.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Brilliant birthday lunch!,50,30 March 2017,"Shin Minori is one of my favourite go-to Jap places and since it was introduced to me three birthdays ago, I have made it a birthday special every year. This year though was the extra perk of enjoying a free birthday lunch buffet in honour of Shin Minori's 10th year anniversary! Definitely worth it(: and the lunch time service was really good! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",There is some areas of improvement,40,29 March 2017,"Overall the dining experience as a whole was amazing but it was just the ordering of the food as well as the duration to wait for the food to arrive was pretty slow. An example was like I ordered 3 glass of ice water and it took a good 10 minutes to be send to my table. Other than that, food quality was excellent!"

Price is worth it during the promo but I don't think I would pay the usual price. Food is alright, not fantastic. Sushi is pretty average. Was seated at a very cramped table when there were many empty tables around. Staff probably didn't want to walk and so seated all the customers nearby, putting us in very awkward close proximity."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet worth the $ if you eat sashimi ,40,25 March 2017,"I like the a la carte buffet style which requires making our order through the tablet -- it cuts down waiting time and you can decide how big a portion you want, hence reduces food wastage. A wide range is offered, the food is of quality and served hot. It was our second time back and it didn't disappoint. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh, fast service (mostly)",40,19 March 2017,"We were looking for a buffet place that features Japanese dishes, and decided to try this place after reading other positive reviews.The place was apparently quite popular, as it got crowded quickly.They offer either a la carte or buffet here. You basically order your food using electronic tablets available at each table. The menu on the tablet shows not just names of the dishes but also pictures, serving size (which allows you to know how much of each dish you are actually getting), and explains what each dish was. Basically, you select the dish that you want, indicate the portions, add it to the order, and click send. The process was quite simple and smooth.In general, orders arrive soon after we submitted them; mostly within about 2-3 minutes. Some dishes though, might take longer. For reasons we could not figure out, our orders of gyoza took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Sometimes they do miss an order, and you have to check with them. We had dishes that didn't show up until we asked them about it. So diners will have to keep tab on what's been served and what's yet to be served.We found the sashimi and sushi to be fresh, and the food were tasty.One disappointing issue was that drinks were not included in the buffet; not even green tea or water. You have to pay for those.We found the service to be acceptable, generally prompt. Staff were also friendly.At about S$40 per person, we felt that the buffet price was reasonable, especially if you enjoy sashimi and order lots of those.Overall this was a place worth visiting."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,50,17 March 2017,There is a variety of fresh food! The salmon slices although thick was really good! It was an eat-all-you-can buffet and hence I felt it was very value for money!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner with friends,50,17 March 2017,"The food quality is very fresh. The staff are all very friendly and alert.

Typical Japanese restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet at Shin Minori,30,16 March 2017,"Food was decent and staff were friendly, helpful and prompt at services. However tables were small and diners were all squeezed at one area of the restaurant, making the place squeezy and noisy not very conducive for a buffet. Aircon didn seem to be working well either."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad service,10,15 March 2017,The staff can only converse in mandarin. Last order was made known to us at 2130hrs and closing time is 2230 but at 2200hrs their staff were all packed and waiting at main entrance to close the restaurant. Feels so unwelcomed.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Feedback,40,13 March 2017,Food variety is great. Service of staff are average. Chope printed out Groupon was show to staff before dinning but when bill arrived no discount was shown on the bill. Got to direct staff to double check the printed Groupon was with them. Time waste on billing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but poor service,30,13 March 2017,"The service was slow... We have to wait quite a while before drinks were served or to get the attention of the waiters/ waitresses to check on our missing orders. But the food served was fresh, especially the sashimi."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dining experience,40,13 March 2017,"Food quality is great, the shashimi is very fresh. However service at the counter can be further improved."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bday gathering,40,12 March 2017,We were placed to seat at near cashier whereas the staff and customers keep hitting against our chair. The seating arrangement is too cramp. We ordered Dragonfly Maki Roll with others however till the end of our meal this dish yet to serve to us. Overall still a good meal experience with shine minori 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Takoyaki A Major Score ,50,12 March 2017,The kids felt like having Japanese so we decided to call at Shin Minori to allow them to select what they liked. Buffet was around $37 per pax and the selection variety was good. Sashimi was fresh so we had two servings. The rest of the dinner was featured with a surprise find of Takoyaki. The kids loved this street food in our recent trip to Japan. It was a key highlight of the evening! 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,50,12 March 2017,"The quality, portion size and everything was perfect for the both of us as we love to try everything in small portions and order the stuff we like again.. Very value for money even if we were not using the bday voucher that was sent.. Shin Minori is very customer oriented, but heads up during peak times service may be a bit slower if you are rushing for time as they have many orders to process, however the waiting times were perfect for my S.O. and I to hold conversation and short break in between courses haha "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Can try,30,12 March 2017,"Food was serve slow during lunch time. Service with service crew is OK, but the front counter not so welcoming."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good Service, Average Food.",30,7 March 2017,"Overall, it was a good experience. The sashimi were fresh and the cooked dishes were average, not bad but nothing amazing about it. We went for the promotion (Free Alaska Snow Crab Nabe with every 2 paying adult for lunch buffet). Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of waiting and inquiring about the waiting time after ordering the Nabe for a couple of times, we were informed that the Alaska Snow Crab Nabe ($32) was not available, which they replaced with the Hotate Chizu Mentaiyaki (5 pcs at $22.00, but we were only given 4 pieces).However, the service staffs were cheery and friendly, which I appreciate very much."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Booking of Appointment is a MUST!,40,6 March 2017,"The place is always packed with lots of people!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,20,5 March 2017,"Food was average or even some was below average.Waiting time for each of the items ordered were at least 30-45 minutes, excluding Sashimis which took 10-15mins for a plate.The waiting time was horrible and there were people around my table asking for their food too. I ordered takoyaki balls, quail eggs, ton katsu and gyoza which took more than an hour to arrive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Weekend buffet lunch,40,3 March 2017,"Book a table of 5 for weekend lunch. Was the first to go into the restaurant. Order some food thru the tablet. But some food never came. Notice other diner also had this problem. When we ask a few time about the order some, some dishes told were sold out. And after few rounds of checking the dishes came out. Other dishes were serve promptly. The Kani crab and toufu dishes were the ones that told 1.5 hr and was not serve despite many round of asking and checking with the staff. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Need improvement,50,3 March 2017,The service need to be improved as well as the order being processed. A lot of customer send in their order but didn't receive the food at all and order was being cancelled. Some even send in order when they enter the restaurant but food was sent to their table at the end of their meal (where there are already full) 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of food,40,2 March 2017,"As per other reviews, the food were all pretty yummy , especially the crunchy maki! Serving of the food was also fast"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average Experience,30,26 February 2017,Basic sashimi selection. Grilled selection was ok nothing to crow about. We also ordered soup which was a nice change from the usual miso.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only value for money if there's voucher,20,26 February 2017,"There are varieties of food available but the quality is mediocre. If there's no birthday voucher to be used during this visit, it's not worth your effort and calories to visit this restaurant. Totally has no idea how this restaurant won the best buffet restaurant of the year. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value but service could be better,40,24 February 2017,"The food is great but the staff are not very friendly or helpful if you are not local. Very busy so be prepared to wait for your order and book in advance, unlikely you will get in as a walk-in. Good location close to Boat Quay. Food is amazing and freshly prepared - hence the waiting times. Great value compared with Australian prices for sushi. All you can eat! Alcohol expensive. Tip - order a selection of hot and cold at same time as cold will come out faster!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality sashimi,40,24 February 2017,Customers of the japanese buffet menu are spoiled for choices. The food are freshly prepared and sashimi are very fresh. Will definitely come back again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food, not enough service staff",40,24 February 2017,"Not the first time I've been to shin minori; this is our family's go-to restaurant for Jap ala-carte buffet. A group of 4 of us went for the lunch buffet, it was pretty crowded though it was a weekday. Glad to have made the reservation on chope or we may not have been able to get a seat. Food was good, as usual, always love the sashimi which is extremely high quality, thick, fresh pieces. However, the service that day was particularly slow, though I attribute it to only 4 floor staff and thus I feel it isn't really their fault. Perhaps the management may want to look to hiring more staff for service or it is very tiring for them as well to serve continuously for hours. Other than that, shin minori doesn't disappoint and they are definitely a restaurant we will continue to visit :) "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Buffet Lunch,40,24 February 2017,"Food portion such as chawanmushi & soup were reduce as compared to my previous visit some time back, the rest of items are still good.Service wise, probably due to lunch time so service wasn't so prompt, takes awhile for them to respond to our requests.Oerall, still a good dining experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad level of dining experience,10,22 February 2017,Beware that you need to print out the Chope voucher before you dine as there is zero empathy from the restaurant manager if you don't have the hard copy. We request if we could change seats but was turned down and lastly when we asked if drinks was included in the buffet we were told clearly that only water and green tea was free despite that they will actually charged you for it. When I asked about the charges all I received was a cunning smile that the drinks are not free but FREE FLOW.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebration,40,22 February 2017,"Second time there with friends to celebrate birthday, is a good trial for friends. If it could include some desert that will complete the meal."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value good quality,50,22 February 2017,"Good value for its ala-carte Jap buffet.
Sashimi cuts were thick and juicy. One of the few that offer temajiki (swordfish) sashimi.
Good service too."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Gathering,50,20 February 2017,Good and value for money! Sashimi was fresh and the food was good as well. There's a lot of people so service may be slow. But customers will have to understand.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and service,30,20 February 2017,"The food is nice n quite fresh. Because we are having buffet lunch,some of the food we ordered didnt come.and we order again.the service is ok too.the food delivery quite fast."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese I have had outside of Australia,50,20 February 2017,"Found this place on the net, they have an all you can eat buffet so went on a Saturday night only to find it was booked out, our mistake so we booked for the next night. looking forward to it all day as last day in Singapore and certainly not disappointed, seated you have an ipad with menu on it and start selecting dishes and they arrive very timely some slower than others as they are made to order, from the first plate that turned up WOW, I've had plenty of Japanese here at home but this was just different and so much better in a way I cant describe as I'mnot a food critic, only had to stop as had to catch taxi to airport, if I had to find a fault the woman on reception was rather brash but didn't spoil our experience, definitely on my must things to do next time in Singapore which wont be long."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori dinner,20,18 February 2017,"Visited on valentines day, restaurant was crowded and couples where separated by wooden dividers. Conversations from other couples could be easily heard and there was no privacy. The food arrived extremely slow(about 20mins waiting time for 2 pieces of sushi) and we did not receive many of the food that we ordered. Moreover, we received servings of food that we did not order. Its understandable that the restaurant may have been busy that's why the food arrive late but how can we be served food that we did not order ourselves? that's hilarious. I dont mean to give a bad review to complain, I really hope shin minori can really up their service standards."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Second time here!,40,18 February 2017,"As the title suggests it was my second time at Shin Minori. It wasn't as crowded as the first time, but probably because it was a weekday lunch. Food was delivered promptly and I noticed the staff were friendlier this time round :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and fast service,40,17 February 2017,Service was really fast but the food was not bad. The atmosphere was good and they were very friendly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi till e last dish is too chunky,40,17 February 2017,Food is good initially. Seem the chefs are lazy or not professional. The last dish is inedible as it's big chunks of raw fish which after one mouth full. You can feel like vomit cos the raw fish juice are too much. Shall cut thinner like the initial dish out. Overall ok . Jus the last dish of sashimi standard dropped n wasted the food. How can a chef cut the raw fish into so big chunks?
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reservation table,20,16 February 2017,I reservation table for valentine dinner with my wife and we reach there early and they told me even i book it at 8.30pm also does not confirm have table for me. but after 8.30pm we go in and the tablet keep having problem cant order and we only have 45mins to order food all before close and service are lousy keep calling but no one is serveing and we still giving service charge of 15 dollars for nothing. asking for refill have to wait for 1hrs then refill it. ice cream is so smaller then other customer which is early came in for dinner. it is not wroth to come here for dinner with important date. my wife and i was so upset of this yr celebration. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Never returning,10,16 February 2017,"Horrible waiting time, food not served despite countless request, cold foods, poor quality of food although many choices. Price doesn't match quality of food expected"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet restaurant,30,16 February 2017,"Overall, Shin Minori proves to be an extremely value-for-money buffet restaurant. Premium cuts of sashimi, together with a wide variety of delectable grilled dishes, sushis, fried dishes, maki! Most of the dishes are above average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good but,50,16 February 2017,The staff sometime uhhh not responsive leh food is food as usual ummm clean and presentable all in all
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food was good but the ""cleaning lady"" from the kitchen spoilt the entire experience for us.",20,15 February 2017,"Food was above average and commendable. As was the service given the entire network crashed. It took a half hour before staff efficiently managed ""manually"". we were impressed with how they managed the situation. The evening was a completely loss when the cleaning lady form the kitchen pushed out a trolley load of trash bags and asked me to move. I was seated and still having my dinner. I asked what she meant in disbelief and she shouted in mandarin ""move away."" my partner was so taken aback he stood up and insisted we leave immediately. Sadly, i did not get to finish my dinner. Not quite acceptable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Japanese Buffet,50,15 February 2017,Great choice for Japanese Buffet for any occasions. Value for money. Serves in small portions so that you can enjoy everything on the menu. Will sure come back for more.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service should be better,40,15 February 2017,"The food was good; the sashimi fresh. The service was very slow - you order what you want through the ipad at your table - some items took a long time to arrive and others never came. There was a lot of waiting, making the overall experience less than satisfactory"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi galore!,40,15 February 2017,"Even if you are not going for sashimi, there are also lots of other good stuff like the crab soup. But of course, people go there for sashimi which is good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food and Fast Service,40,14 February 2017,Food served at Shin Minori is fresh and their service is fast. Sashimi sliced a little too thick. Almost double of what we get in other Japanese restaurants. I personally prefer it to be slightly thinner.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Early Vday dinner,40,14 February 2017,"First visit to this place.
Since my gf and I love Jap food, we decided to try this restaurant out. The food was good and we'll back again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori - Shining ever so brightly,40,14 February 2017,"The crowd at the restaurant was simply astounding, but service was considerable brisk and food standard was still quite good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good place for families'/friends' gathering,30,14 February 2017,Good hangout place for get together. A good variety of food selection but average tasting for food..the food serving time was quite long due to understaffing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Food,50,12 February 2017,Excellent food and service. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again next with my family members.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Over rated,30,12 February 2017,"Food quality is over rated in your review. Except for sashimi, rest of dishes were either too salty or mostly overlooked, non authentic at all"

Easy reservation
Happy overall .
Will visit soon again and thank you."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection,50,11 February 2017,I should say it has quite a good selection of food for us to choose from. Sashimi was fresh which is important! Yakirori was a plus point
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food is good in quality and serving size.,50,10 February 2017,"Visit the restaurant for a simple Business Lunch. Variety of food is many, taken the Buffet and feel free when placing the order without worry."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great 1-for 1 buffet,40,9 February 2017,The buffet is value for money if it's 1-for-1 as charges for other items like drinks are over priced. The teriyaki BBQ items are a tad too sweet but salted grill are alright. The sashimi slices are thick and juicy. This is good for regular Japanese fare.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,30,8 February 2017,"Serve me soup but didn't provide me with a spoon. Ask for a spoon but I finished my meal already also never come. Ask for bill 3 to 4 times but still didn't come. In the end, I walk up to the counter to pay my bill. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,40,7 February 2017,Had a pleasant experience here celebrating my wife's birthday. Food was good except the grilled items which were burnt and overcooked. Staff were helpful and engaging but they are a little shorthanded during peak periods. Overall satisfied and will come back in future!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and ambience poor,20,6 February 2017,Not a very good experience for ambience. Venue quite run down. Variety of food for the price could be better
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Superb food, average service",50,4 February 2017,"Went to Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant on the 2nd Feb. Restaurant want not that busy when we entered. The reason I always patronise this restaurant is because the food and free flow and we don't have to get up from our seat. It's all ordered from a tablet which is provided on the tables. The food quality and presentation is really great. However I feel that providing wasabe for every single dish is very wasteful. Most of the times the staff had to clear my plate with the wasabe not even touched. Service staff there are average. However I feel that the managers there should take their job more seriously. Most of the time I can see them chit chatting in the back and even eating food at the back during service. When I thank them for clearing my plates they just totally ignore me. If you are looking for good food this is the place. However, don't expect any service "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good jap food,50,3 February 2017,"Lovely food and good service :)
Though they were very busy
They kept smiling and making sure we are happy . Thanks"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,50,2 February 2017,"most value for money japanese buffet I had in the longest time, sashimi was thick and fresh with no fishy taste and the dishes were served hot. However, would like to feedback that clearing service could have been done faster due to space constraint of the tables. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb quality,50,2 February 2017,"The sashimi were fresh and they were generous with the portions. It's disgusting to see how other patrons just over ordered and waste the sashimi. It's definitely value for money for the sushi and sashimi. The fried stuff we're mediocre and the grilled ones are better. There is a little bit of inconsistency with the quality of the fried and grilled food but then again, it's a buffet and the chef is really busy handling the crazy amount of orders!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food Great, Service Poor",30,2 February 2017,The food was very good and the alarm Carter buffet electronic ordering system easy. However when the food was delivered the server just abruptly dropped the plate at the edge of the table and did not make an effort to place it between the diners. Also clearing plates after they were finished was not done in a timely manner. Nor was the free-flow tea refreshed when the glass was empty. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese Buffet,50,2 February 2017,"Quality of the sashimi is good. Majority of the dishes are good. Overall, it's value for money as most of the items are good. They do have nice sake."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very poor service,20,1 February 2017,Utterly disappointed with the restaurant that was branded to be the best buffet restaurant in 2016. Very poor services by the waitresses with rude expressions.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chinese New Year family meal,30,1 February 2017,Under-staff so the wait for food took longer than expected. The food quality also suffers as a result of the situation
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CNY Dinner,30,1 February 2017,Good range of food but service was slow and not all items ordered were delivered to us despite repeated reminders. Surprised to see sashimi was cut into 1-1.5cm thick.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Limited choices for the value we paid,30,31 January 2017,Visited the restaurant for the 1st time to celebrate my son's 21st birthday but was a big disappointment. The food quality are average n choices limited. Sashima quality are average as well and there are more Jap buffet we visited are of better choices and comparable in price too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good sashimi, the cooked food is meh...",30,29 January 2017,"Loved the sashimi, fresh and delicious....But the cooked food was overcooked and dry. Service was okay...price is exp considering the average quality of the cooked food"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly service but food is average,30,29 January 2017,"The staff were friendly but the food quality was much lower than expected and the buffet does not even come with any drinks, not even water ... and no desserts either.. a bit disappointing ...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Services,30,27 January 2017,"Went to have early reunion dinner at shin minori, serving of food was kinda slow due to most probably not enough manpower for servers. Requested water refill but took quite some time to have it served to us. Few of our orders were missed out, waitress came to ask for last order and told that they left out few of our orders, went back to check but never came back and came to ask the second time for last order but we just forget about it instead"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ok food choice,30,26 January 2017,Food was not thaaat nice. Priced too highly for a single cuisine meal. Lunch was like 40 plus per person? Who would be willing to spend that much on a lunch at such a deserted mall? Price should be reduced to entice more customers
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A Let Down,20,26 January 2017,"Was looking forward to have a value for money dinner and great company on Tuesday, 24. But was it was a total let down. Thank God the sashimi was fresh and they were generous with their servings. If you are not a sashimi fan, you may wanna give this place a miss. I must say they do have a good variety on the menu for the amount they charge, but.... the bunch of us would rather go for value and quality to variety!Most of the grilled items we ordered were so tiny and dry in texture and some of them are cold!!!! We were sooooo totally mislead by the photos in the menu. Oh ya, if you are conscious of salt intake - this is not the place for you either, their cooked food is en general to the salty side. We wanted to put in a special request but the tablet that has a remarks xolumn doesn't allow us to do so. Food came fast but the service were not up to standard. There were 8 of us with 3 tablets (it is obvious that they have linked the table to fit our number of pax) and we ordered using different tablets. To us, it's basic knowledge or only logical to serve the food to the table where the orders were keyed. But 2 of thier service staff did not do so. They just dumped the food at one side and expect us to pass on. The level of basic service should be up in this. Overall, it was a disappointment for me and it shall be my first and my last to visit this food chain. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi nice,30,26 January 2017,"Nice food. Though we ordered via the system, we noted there were instances where the food did not arrive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",1st time visit to Shin Minori,50,25 January 2017,"The food was fresh, and the service was not bad. Missed a few orders but since its buffet and it was crowded, it is really not an issue."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Family dinner,40,24 January 2017,This was the 1t time we dine at Shin Minori restaurant. It was recommended by my colleague. Overall food ok but serving flow was a bit slow but speed up later. Probably it was a Sunday dinner & more diners.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",average jap buffet,30,24 January 2017,generally everything was way too sweet.. the good things are you could order by precise pieces so can reduce wastage and try more varierty.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Buffet,50,23 January 2017,Food was very delicious and service was good. Ording was very easy and straight forward using tablet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service has improved,50,22 January 2017,Surprisingly service was very fast and they didn't miss any order this time despite full house. Food was also less salty. Kudos to improvement
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good deal with birthday promotion,40,22 January 2017,"The food was not bad, sashimi was good. The selection / variety was ok. Definitely value for money!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch,30,22 January 2017,"Good food in general. You place your order on a tablet. Some of the food ordered did not come. When I mentioned this to one of the waiters, he told me to simply place another order. I thus had to wait quite a bit. Some food came twice. When I pointed out that one of the dishes did not seem fresh, the waiter (who seemed senior) gave me a blank look and did not bother to apologise or replace it. I would still go back though."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Satisfactory standards for a Jap restaurant,40,20 January 2017,First visit to Shin Minori and was pleasantly surprised at the selection. Generous portioning of the sashimi slices which were fresh. Grilled dishes less impressive. Only negative is the noise from the renovations upstairs.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food is fresh,40,20 January 2017,The sashimi is fresh and generously sliced. Always visit this restaurant with my hubby. Introducing group of friends over to celebrate birthday on 20th Jan.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,30,19 January 2017,Quite value for money but some items get loss in process of ordering . Worst of all seated next to a family with 2 very disruptive kids
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori,50,18 January 2017,The sashimi is fresh and the grilled food tasted amazing! I would definitely come back here again :)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",food orders did not arrive,30,18 January 2017,have ordered some food but most of it did not arrive. have to reorder again and yet same issue. service did not clear the table till the food order came.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible,10,17 January 2017,"Service was terrible, food was over fried and over salted. It took forever for anything we ordered to arrive, and it was cramp and sounded like a fish market. For $10 more, we could have gone to Marriot for their weekend buffet, We are never, ever returning."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,30,17 January 2017,"Come with a very small serving when you place an order. Waiting time is long. Overall, the price is still not valuable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An average dining experience,30,15 January 2017,"Booked the restaurant from the stellar reviews found online. Thought the food was alright. The sashimi slices were particularly thick but not great. We order a variety of sashimi but felt too full to continued with much of the other cooked dishes. For the same price, I think there are better Japanese buffet restaurants. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average quality fare,30,9 January 2017,"Decided to visit this joint as I saw that it was voted as one of the best buffet restaurants by Chope. Also, because the entertainer app has 1-1 buffet lunch, I thought it would be worth a try.The food was just average in my opinion though they have quite a good variety of items on the buffet menu. None of the items were exceptionally good, more like mass produced food type of quality. Service was good, the staff was prompt in serving and clearing. The experience reminds me of Nihon Mura. While the value is there, I doubt I will be returning anytime soon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad front desk receptionist,20,9 January 2017,Everything else was fine except for the front desk receiptionist whom answered my call. He was extremely rude.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only sashimi is good.,20,9 January 2017,Only the sashimi is good. None of the cooked food is nice. Yakitori is either tasteless or sauce too sweet. Bean sprouts teppanyaki is very oily. Sushi is average.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food n good value..,50,8 January 2017,"Service Stuff very attentive n profesional
Food served fresh n fast
Atmospher very cosy and suitable for All fucntion.."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chope Telephone Reservation,30,8 January 2017,"The reservation is good but the incessant telephone call through Viber and telephone call is very irritating. After confirming the reservation, the system keeps calling you despite confirming it a few times. It will keep calling until you answer and even is you answer and confirm it, it still keep calling. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi and sushi,30,7 January 2017,"Pros:Sashimi cuts were clean and texture of fish was good. Sushis were quite appetising like fried california roll and the eel with cheese ones. However, sadly no salmon belly or aburi unlike Ikoi (another jap buffet). Cons:Most fried food like sashimo and gyoza is not nice. Both of these were underdone and gyoza was too oily. Service was slow (I understand that as the place was almost filled) but towards the end, we sat for about an hour chatting and some items we ordered did not even come. Overall, would only recommend this place for sushi and sashimi. Definitely not the best buffet like what people voted. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable and delicious buffet,50,5 January 2017,"I keep coming back here for the sashimi. For a buffet dinner, the quality is good. The other food items are tasty as well and the selection is wide."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent & Fresh Sushi served,50,4 January 2017,Went during 1st Jan. food served is fresh and fast. Atmosphere is average. Waiters are polite and prompt in what you requested for.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Japanese buffet place but lacks punch on the taste,30,3 January 2017,Was there for lunch to celebrate my gf birthday. Menu variety was ok and ordered food comes quite promptly. But my hamachi sashimi cut was way to thick hehe...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese ala cart buffet ,40,2 January 2017,"Sashimi was good , not the thinly sliced types that u get at most buffets . Food was cooked upon ordering so they arrive hot, so expect to wait a little .
But it's worth it. Definitely will visit again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,20,1 January 2017,"Restaurant was packed and I understand that the staff were busy, but that does not mean that they had to be rude. Lots of food order from the buffet menu wasnt served, asked to refill water but was ignored, even the lady manager was rude from the way she spoke. China staff even had to mumble to show that she was displeased when we requested to change seats before being seated. Horrible experience. Sushi and sashimi was okay but cooked food took up to an hour to be served yet served cold. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Inconsistent dining experience.,30,31 December 2016,"This was my fourth time there. The food has been inconsistent, ranging from good when the restaurant is quiet to overcooked yakitori when the restaurant is crowded. The last visit I went. The restaurant had a company function. Service was slow, inattentive and the food was mostly dry and over-cooked. Not a good experience since I brought my bf's mother there for a treat"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Tasty and delicious food,40,31 December 2016,Good and balanced list of food selection. We were led into a VIP room near the main door however the shoe rack for 10 persons and many carton boxes have produced some odour. Hope this can be improved.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food!,50,31 December 2016,I used the entertainer app for 1-for-1 and the price is definitely worth it. my second visit to this shop!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, kitchen staff are amazing!",40,30 December 2016,"Think as we ate throughout the buffet, being seated at the chef's counter, we got to witness the flurry that the chefs experienced as orders furiously and continously flooded the kitchen. We were amazed at how the chefs worked under such intense speed and pressure, and honestly this is a clear indication that as diners, we need to learn to be patient and wait rather than assume that this is a buffet line and expect our food to come continuously and non-stop. The quality of the food was great, as usual, the staff were helpful (most of them) and offered great service. Had a pleasant experience dining here, not my first time and will definitely not be my last either (: "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food,30,29 December 2016,"Generally, service staff is courteous. However, serving of food is pretty slow. I had the ala-carte buffet lunch. Honestly i am quite surprised that the price for buffet does not include drinks."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Considerate service, extensive menu",50,28 December 2016,"Considerate service, extensive menu. Though as a la carte buffets go, some ordered items tend to go missing. But this is not a big issue. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not impressive...,30,28 December 2016,"3rd visit. Standard seems to have dropped. Bones found in sashimi, and cooked items r disappointing."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food at decent pricing,40,28 December 2016,"The food is quite good, doesn't feel like it is mass produced though it is a la carte buffet style. Mum loves the clam miso soup."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Gd food, fast service",40,27 December 2016,"We went for Xmas dinner, food quality is gd and food was served to us fast even though it is a busy night. We love our dinner dining experience. For the price we paid for Xmas dinner we were expecting to have more choice for the buffet menu or special items for Xmas but we got the usual buffet menu. Overall is pretty gd.. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Small portions,30,27 December 2016,Their default portion per serving is small. Not all orders were served. Food is okay. Value for the food is too much
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome,50,25 December 2016,"Good food, and very nice setting! Some food arrived a little slow, Generally a good dining experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Terrible service not so fresh sashimi,10,24 December 2016,"Bad service wanted act blur spoke to him but he just kept walking, tablet broke down, sashimi was not all that fresh! And it was so expensive $50 per person"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow Service and Average Food,20,23 December 2016,Orders through electronic tablet frequently timed out. Food took a long time to come. Taste quality was mostly average. Called for service through tablet twice for refill and no one responded. Had to finally ask serving waiter to do it.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Please go to other nice Japanese restaurant,10,22 December 2016,"Food is served in very small amount/quantity. Some food were brought to our table not hot, but super cold. Keep serving wrong food and have to wait quite a long while. Waiters/ Waitresses friendliness depends on your luck that day. Most were rude and cannot be bothered with you. Many people said that their standards dropped. Some grilled food were raw inside.Overall, save your money to go to other Jap restaurants."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food,40,21 December 2016,A lot of variety of food to choose from the menu for the buffet. Service staff very helpful and friendly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner buffet,30,20 December 2016,"First time trying Shin Minori, there is not much choices for the food. Crew are not friendly at all. Never hit the min standard as a Japanese food restaurant. Bit disappointed!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,40,20 December 2016,"Place is decent. Food is tasty especially the grilled food and the sashimi is very fresh. However, service is a bit slow. and staffs not very attentive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Missing Food Order,20,19 December 2016,Some of the food we ordered were not served despite the fact we asked the staff to help us check and confirm that we have indeed placed the order.We have been here several times and we have experienced similar missing orders. But this time is the worst!I think it is time to look for a new place.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",shin minori,30,18 December 2016,for a buffet oriented restaurant i must say the sahimi items were good and thats only all i can say for this restaurant. short handed on staff as well.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,40,18 December 2016,Had a very good dinner at Shin Minori on Friday. This restaurant has been around for many years and they dish out decent Japanese food.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pleasant dining at Shin Minori,40,17 December 2016,"Food taste great, but orders are missing. Check with waiters, they inform us that missing orders we have to re-order again. Price is acceptable also!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,40,13 December 2016,I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was a pleasant experience. The food would always come out at different times but the staff were friendly and helpful.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reasonable spread,30,12 December 2016,"Ordering system improved much from the last time i visited 3 or 4 months back? Sashimi is fresh! But some items can be done better - 1) cha soba was over cooked that it was soggy. N portion size could be smaller. 2) beansprouts was crunchy and nice but super oily :( Other than that, not much complaints. It was even more worthwhile with the entertainer 1for1 deal. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service was slow,30,12 December 2016,"Food took long to serve. when we questioned, staff insisted all our orders were out. 2nd time, food was slow too. Took them 3 times to inform us the wine we chosen was sold out n we waited 20 min for it."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pleasant dinner with love one,50,12 December 2016,"Overall dinner at shin minori is very nice, starting from booking of reservation, order of food using tablet till bill payment. Everything's is very smooth! Not disturbance during your dinner too. Atmosphere is like you are in your own world, Only when food is served or need any help from the staff. Value for money, Will visit again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it.,30,12 December 2016,"Not worth to travel so far to a place which is not convenient. We can have the same quality of food at town. Food choices are limit, and drinks are not included in the package, thus ultimately is more than what you expected."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,30,10 December 2016,"Standard has dropped since the past few times I went, quite disappointing.
The portions were inconsistent, some way too big, some way too small. Very different from initially."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good service and generous portions.,40,9 December 2016,Not a good place if you are trying to lose weight or if your Body mass index is too high. Getting really popular and crowded.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food but not suitable for big groups,40,9 December 2016,"Went there as a group of 24 to celebrate my boy's birthday. Was given a private room but it was very packed to the point of discomfort. Food was great but some of the ala carte buffet orders went mixed up due to ""overwhelming"" order through the iPad system. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice,50,8 December 2016,Very very nice food❤ although it was quite hot as we were sitting near the windows. But the food was amazing!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A La Carte Buffet Style but Service need Major Improvement,20,7 December 2016,"A La Carte Buffet Style is good as the food is Hot but order is in a mess, some order is deliver wrong and repeated, some even never come.Chawamushi is very nice!Large group is not recommended as they have only 1 ordering tablet per table."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food at this restaurant,40,6 December 2016,"Value for money. Service staff very polite. Manager waived payment for wrong order, no questions asked."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Authentic Japanese buffet,40,6 December 2016,"Warm and friendly greet from the manager. Like the tablet ordering and serving portion, so we don't have to waste food. The only thing is that some of the food take very long time to come, come after our 4th or 5th round of order (45 min). After all, satisfied and will recommend for it good service and good food "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and efficient service.,30,6 December 2016,"This place is quite popular, so I decided to book a day in advance. However, the earliest time slot for the ala cart lunch buffet was 1 pm.Food was ordered thru a tablet which was very easy to use. Service was surprisingly fast despite the crowd. Now the food. The variety and selection was good. Taste wise however is nowhere close. There is really nothing to make one say that wow, I really have to order this the next time I'm here. Nevertheless, it did serve it's function as we were rather hungry at 1 plus pm.Please be warned that last order is at 2. 00. We barely finished the initial order when we were politely told of that. Perhaps it is my fault that I did not notice it on the website when I did the booking. So do book earlier time slots if you like to linger and take your time in eating."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The rise and fall of service,20,5 December 2016,"My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary and were looking forward to a wonderful selection of Japanese food and some quality service. Unfortunately, to our dismay, food wasnt great and service was atrocious. They firstly kept getting our orders wrong and till this day we still wonder where our unagi sushi and spider maki disappeared to. They probably eloped and found a nice little home in a hill unbeknown to us. What more, staff didnt seem happy to serve us and we even saw a few of them trying to communicate in mandarin to the Filipino guys beside us, which was puzzling because they clearly could not understand what the service staff were saying. Apart from the sashimi and stir fried beef, everything else tasted like it came from a salt factory, not sure if they were trying to mask the flavours of the food or kill the bacteria in it. The raw squid tasted like they had talcum powder powdered all over it like a baby's rash filled bottom. Definitely not a place for a first date... But maybe your last..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value for money,40,5 December 2016,"Sashimi was nice.
Restaurant was packed wish made the ambiance quite lively.
Would go back for the buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,50,4 December 2016,Fresh sashimi! Sushi items are all great. Grilled items so-so only. Overall still value for money. Will definitely go back again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really Awful Experience,10,3 December 2016,"Had a really awful experience. Made reservations for 630pm and reached there at 645 pm due to heavy traffic (Standard Chartered Marathon - road closure). Reservations were given away - claimed that our booking was 6 pm instead of 630 pm from their system and they sent SMS confirmation with we did not receive. If we did, we could have changed because it was not what we wanted. Winnie the manager was very adamant - although system is as good as what staff key in (garbage in garbage out) because we booked via phone not internet. No apologies only impoliteness. I would not recommend the place at all neither would my family / and I ever patronise this restaurant. Very poor customer service...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent selections,30,1 December 2016,"Decent selections but not cheap. Costs $80+ after GST. Had to pay for beverage too. Ordering was made easy with tablet but the tablet would restart when you've ordered a certain amount which can be irritating as you would relaunch the app and re order. Quantity was reasonable, small portions for an ala- carte buffet. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,40,30 November 2016,"A good ala cart japanese buffet with sizeable range of food.
We went for Monday dinner so it's pretty quiet. But the orders still went missing and we were unsure if we should wait or reorder."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese a la carte eat all you want....,40,30 November 2016,"Great Japanese 'order off the menu' buffet, set in a cosy and relaxed atmosphere. It's eat all you want a la-carte, complete with a reasonably substantial ipad menu. Service is prompt, efficient and cheerful.. The price is wallet friendly, considering it's Japanese, its located in Singapore and its eat as much as you desire. Its not cheap but affordadable for Singapore. Importantly, the food is really good., actually its great. Authentic (I've lived in Japan) and you can eat asquickly or as slowly and relaxed as you wish.Drinks are reasonably priced too (by Singaporean standards).Good enough to return? Absolutely. Going again this weekend. Recommended.Tip: Make a reservation, it gets busy and the restaurant doesnt seat many...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebrations at Restaurant on Weekend night,30,29 November 2016,Staff helpful and friendly. Food is on the average side though. Initially had the expectations that us was awesome based on review. Possibly over expectated. Other wise it was decent
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with Entertainer app,40,28 November 2016,"Sashimi was fresh and variety is quite good. I particularly enjoyed the pumpkin chawanmushi which is not found in other japanese restaurants. We used Entertainer app so we only paid the price of one for both of us which made the lunch very value for money. The only downside was the tablet for ordering the food. The tablet was not responsive at times and it resulted in us double-ordering as we sent the orders twice, thinking the first time was not captured as the system hanged. As such we had double orders on some dishes which meant we had less stomach for trying other dishes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money Japanese Buffet,50,28 November 2016,This is a great place for unlimited Japanese food at a reasonable price.The assortment of sashimi offered is pretty good. I love the tuna as it's very fresh.All items comes in pretty small sizes which is great as it gives your stomach a chance to savour as much variety as you want.A definite must try if you're into good quality Japanese buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",10/10 restaurant!,50,28 November 2016,Awesome service and even better food! We were promptly served and food always came hot and delicious. Seafood were extremely fresh and staff were polite and helpful. Never been happier! Highly recommend
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese 1 for 1 Buffet,40,28 November 2016,The location is somewhat out of the way from MRT but not to difficult to find. Speed of serving is good but there was order that was made first and yet not delivered after second order. Quality wise OK. Overall good value for money especially with a 1 for 1 offer.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Improved service,50,28 November 2016,Better service than last visit in jul. Staff were diligent in clearing plates & all food items were served. Some items were still salty but that's the usual
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good as usual,40,26 November 2016,"Food was good except the table assigned to us was basically quite tiny, even though there is plenty of unoccupied table at 1.30pm."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great spread. Love the sashimi,40,26 November 2016,Nice ambience and service was polite. I love the sashimi variety there. The lunch buffet was worth the money if you are a sashimi lover. They have quite an extensive grilled spread too!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi,40,22 November 2016,"Despite the crowd on a Sunday evening, the experience was good. The food was on time and in relative good qnatity. Outstanding meal and fresh sashimi to top it. The other thing I like is the ordering system...just order via the iPad... orders don't get lost and you get what you ordered - unlike the other Japanese restaurants where some of the order disappears..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very pleasant experience,40,22 November 2016,"We were there to celebrate friends' birthday. With a total of 10 people, we were given a nice room. The food was fresh - i love the sashimi. The rest of the food were great except for some grilled/ bbq items which were very dry and hard to chew while some orders were forgotten. The service was great as the staff came in to check on us. The price is reasonable and we will definitely go again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food.,50,20 November 2016,"The food was great and worth it. Love the platter of sashimi. They were very fresh. Aside from having wrong or missing food orders due to lack of staff, my family and I enjoy the restaurant overall."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",rigid service with ref to promo voucher,20,16 November 2016,rigid service with ref to promo voucher. Insist that i print out the voucher for the snow crab soup despite they have extra copies. I have also diwnliaded fron phone snd showed to the chinese malaysian kady supervisor! Soup was eventuslly serve but cold!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value lunch buffet,40,14 November 2016,Came here with the 1 for 1 entertainer app and it was definitely well worth the trip! Service was fast and food was pretty all right for the price.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Japanese buffet,50,14 November 2016,"Great food and service, never a disappointment. Went with a group of 7, wide range of food from sashimi, sushi, tempura and teppenyaki dishes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,30,14 November 2016,"For the food, most of them were delicious and well prepared. Each dish comes in a small portion, which is good because you don't have to eat too much and can order other dishes. If you like that dish, you can always order more anyway. The waiters and waitresses were excellent servers. They are professional and friendly, not to mention interactive. They talk to you and understand your needs, rather than those 'follow the books, scripted words' kind of server. However, when the restaurant gets busier, they attended to us slower and the 'call for service' on their ipad was not working (or they are ignoring it). Atmosphere was okay, nicely decorated, however the seat we got was a window seat and it started to get very warm after a while."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value Buffet,40,12 November 2016,Been here with family for birthday celebration. The selection is pretty good and good value for money. Sashimi is fresh.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection of food,40,10 November 2016,"very worth and value for money even though it was quite difficult to locate.
The sashimi are very fresh and i love the shrimp tempura.
However, the buffet does not include drinks.
But you can get a cup of green tea with additional cost."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,30,8 November 2016,"If you are only here for the sashimi, its fresh, thick slice, good range of sashimi. However, other food like the grilled category/ handroll, not very nice. Nothing to rave, but i can say its for sashimi lovers."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quality Japanese Buffet,50,8 November 2016,"First of all, first of this buffet is not cheap, so it might not be the ideal place if you are tight on budget. That said, the buffet price is < $50 after GST & Service charge, with a HUGE variety of japanese food, from classic sushi, sashimi (Salmon, Ika, Maguro, Taco, EVEN FREE-FLOW HAMACHI HOLY), handrolls, to grilled food, cooked food, udon, etc. The chefs are very generous with servings (sashimi was thick and juicy), so you do not have to constantly reorder. They use ipad to order so it is very convenient. Overall, a great place to indulge and satisfy your Japanese food cravings once in a while."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",First Impression,40,6 November 2016,"Food is good and with a wide selection. Price is affordable too. Crowd was quiet for a Thursday dinner. Service could have been improved, we mentioned to the waitress that we were there for the first time but she didn't explain to us what does the buffet package includes. She only told us to order from the menu with a Samsung tablet. We had to ask a second waiter to know about paying additional for drink."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet Lunch,30,2 November 2016,80% of items are rice/noodles. Sashimi was fresh but always served last. Mentaiko spaghetti was bad. It was obviously pre-prepared & heated up in microwave or something. Grilled/Fried items were a tad too salty.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Group gathering,40,31 October 2016,"9 of us had a gathering at shin minori, we are thankful we got the private room. However we wasn't inform that additionally green tea was chargeable. We had 9 hot tea from start and 3 of them wanted to change to cold tea at the end of the dinner. We were charged 12 tea n in total there's 9 of us.."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Perfect,40,31 October 2016,"Given the sat lunch crowd, the food is still cooked perfectly everytime. Sashimi cut at the right thickness."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Slow service, salty food",20,31 October 2016,"Orders are placed via a tablet and we ended up waiting for 15min to be served. Only the sashimi was served quickly, everything else took really long to prepare and we spent more time waiting for our food than eating. The kitchen also forgot many of our orders. Sashimi was ice-cold in the middle and the grilled dishes were too salty. Would not come back again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor quality food and service,20,31 October 2016,"I have dined in Shin Mori a year before, which I have had great experience as the service then was good, so was the quality of food.Encouraged by the good experience before, I went back with 2 other friends on last Friday but the experience was a let down.We were not served any drinks for nearly 1/2 an hour. When we waved to the waiters around, one of them took order for green tea but forgot to serve until we reminded him 10 minutes later. The green tea was not even hot upon serving.The shasimi we ordered was not fresh and the hand rolls were not freshly made.This time my overall experience is poor."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food but service is questionable,30,30 October 2016,"The sashimi and the sushi were nice and fresh. Cuts of sashimi is great unlike some restaurants which are just thin slices. However, the service is terrible. The tablet menu crashes and took a while to recover. The staff were not really around to be called. Ordered food and the items came out in wrong quantity and no one bother letting us know what is what. Had to remind the order is not served. Had to repeat three times and I have to personally walk to the counter to remind. That was after about 30 min of waiting. Impression left on my guest was less to be desired. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with 1 for 1,30,27 October 2016,"Was there for a 1 for 1 promotion with UOB credit card. Ambience was cozy with dim lightings and privacy from other diners assured with separators place between the tables. Overall portion between 2 pax is adequate without being overwhelming and all their maki rolls were really tasty. I would recommend the Pumpkin chawanmushi as well. However as they could be understaffed at the moment, getting their attention is quite challenging. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",1 for 1 promotion using uob card,40,25 October 2016,"This is my first time to Shin Minori. I was worried that the service would be very slow. To my surprise, the food was served very quickly.
As we are using uob card for 1 for 1 promotion, its super worth it"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good place for generous helpings of sashimi,40,25 October 2016,"My second visit to the restaurant was a little more hectic than my first. The iPad ordering service was down but the staff were quick to issue out order sheets. However, this resulted in slowing of service, duplicate orders, and some missing orders. However, the staff who was in charge, Winnie, was always friendly, patient and helpful. She even remained calm after another patron got verbally abusive because of the slow service. Food was good — my fave are the sashimi, crab cream soup, potato salad, etc. My child liked the chawanmushi a lot, and my parents the tempura.Overall, will visit again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for Money,30,25 October 2016,"Came here with more than 30 colleagues from different part of Asia when they were here for a training.

Ordered the bean sprout and it took 40mins to arrive even though there are only few ppl at that time. Everything need to order via the iPad even for a cup of water and it cost $0.80. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best deal for quality sashimi fix!,50,21 October 2016,A trusted place for good quality sashimi at awesome value with UOB 1 for 1 promotion in October 2016. It would be better if you have the promotion with Citibank!

You do not have to wait too long for food to be served. Has quite an array of dishes on the menu. The Mango shebert and green tea cheesecake was fantastic. We enjoyed our meal very much and will certainly make a come back
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh sashimi, everything else average",30,17 October 2016,Food was not as good as I remembered from a few years ago. But quality of the sashimi was still good and fresh. Teppanyaki was good in terms of taste but they could be more generous with the quantity per serving. Maki and other sushi were passable to say the least. Nothing memorable. Service was also a little slow - it took awhile for our food to be served and the time lag between dishes was quite long. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide food varieties,30,17 October 2016,"There ain't many Japanese buffet in Singapore and Minori spread considered good. However, as many have commented, indeed their service isn't prompt for it took us to signal a few times before we got attended to. Just 1 incident to highlight - they need to double check to ensure that the ipad is securely fasten. Mine dropped midway through my meal and caused a mess. But they were fast in this aspect of cleaning. It would have improved our dining experience if they would to relocate us to a clean table instead."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,30,17 October 2016,"Sashimi was fresh. Other food items - not bad, but not fantastic either.Tablet for ordering was lagged, & then went crushed - resulting in some items ordered but not captured.Had to re-order manually with the service staff.Overall ambience not too bad.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One-for-One Buffet Lunch,40,5 October 2016,"UOB card one-for-one deal. Service staff were prompt and friendly. ordered from tablet at table, some orders did not go through and had to key-in all over again. sat at tables near sushi bar and some areas were used as storage with boxes piled up, rather eyesore. food wise, buffet selection was quite wide with sashimi, sushi, teppanyaki, tempura, grilled fish, cooked food like rice, noodles, soup, salad and deep fried stuff. what i did not like was the sashimi wasn't slice uniformly, some were thicker. and there were only 3 items for selection under teppanyaki. ordered the beansprouts, cant recall what was the other 2 items."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Japanese Buffet,40,4 October 2016,"Food - The sashimi was very good. However, dishes with sauce are a bit too salty for our taste.Value - All in about $90 for two without drinks. Would consider it value for money given the quality of food and ambience.Service - We struggled with the ordering system for a while. Requested for a change of table after several attempts by the staffs to fix the tablet.Atmosphere - Typical japanese restaurant. Not too noise for a good chat."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good deal with 1 for 1 card promotion,30,4 October 2016,Sashimi is of good quality ... Other food that we tasted not as expected ... So just rate overall as average. But the 1 for 1 credit card promo makes it much more worthy of the visit
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad attitude,30,3 October 2016,"I had a reservation 3 weeks ago before I went there with my friends. I wanted to have the private room so I put down my remarks via Chope reservation system. When I was there, I told the counter staff I had a private room reservation, but they said rudely ""minimum charge for private room usage must be 450++"". It looks like they were worrying I got no money to pay for it. They continue to say ""So you still want the normal dining table reservation or not?"" I have to bear with it , not for anything else but for my friends. My point is it doesn't matter if I can't get the private room / i have to pay for the private room, It is matter that the counter staff doesn't have the basic manner towards guests.IF the owner of the restaurant happened to see this, please give some guidance to your staff on such matters. [UNLESS THE OWNER FEEL THAT THE STAFF WERE CORRECT TO TELL ME OFF.] I remembered that the counter staffs were 1 guy and 1 lady, both uniforms in black. Seems like they are restaurant manager / supervisor. Date of my visit - 30 Sep 2016."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin- up! :),40,20 September 2016,"This is another outlet of the now closed Shinkei, which was previously at Toa Payoh. The menu is generally the same, with a few slight additions to the barbecued section. Service staff were very meticulous and efficient, always clearing the tables the moment they see empty plates. The manager, Winnie, is very polite, and she is very attentive to details. Remembering the preferences of the customers, she will show initiative in helping them attain their orders quickly. Well Done Shin Minori, all you need now is to have more promotions for loyal customers like me! :)"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Weekday dinner,30,17 September 2016,"Fried items were excellent: crispy, flavorful, juicy, and without a hint oily taste. However, the grilled items were quite disappointing: they were too dry and rather tasteless. Sashimi and maki were rather average. Nevertheless, the service staff was fast, efficient and very courteous. It was surprisingly packed during a weeknight especially since it is not near to an MRT station. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic sashimi,50,16 September 2016,"Booked last minute because we were feeling sashimi. We were of two minds after reading the reviews on how bad the service is, but decided to push ahead having not seen anything other than positive comments about the quality of the food. Glad we did.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Food,40,11 September 2016,"The test of any Japanese restaurant is the freshness of the sashimi.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Extremely Bad Customer Service,10,4 September 2016,"Ordered a dish and reminded them 5 times, kept telling me it is coming and after 1.5 hours still did not serve. Frustrated and called for the bill. Most dishes are tiny in size relative to the market standard. As it was ala-carte buffet, they seemed to be deliberate in serving slowly and conveniently did not serve some dishes thinking that people will forget what they ordered."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth the money,40,16 August 2016,Salmon Sashimi very fresh. Loved the edamame and chawanmushi as well. The white colored sashimi wasn't so fresh we went on 14 August 2016

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-Money Japanese Buffet,40,11 August 2016,"We visited on a public holiday for buffet lunch. The restaurant was full-house. It might be best to place reservations in advance. The food was fresh and delectable. We especially enjoyed the sashimi, yakitori selection and various maki creations. It is best to place orders for most of the items you want at one go. Subsequent orders take awhile to arrive or might be left out, possibly due to shortage of manpower. Other than this little inconvenience, we were pleased with the quality and variety of food. I will certainly return again with friends/family for fuzz free Japanese fare. The bill for our lunch buffet (4 persons) added up to approximately $185 (including drinks). "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre for price,20,5 August 2016,"Sashimi quality average. Ordered tako sashimi but was told they only give tentacles and head only, I will need to order tako sushi if i wanted the sliced ones. Grilled dishes are generally alright. Overall an average Japanese buffet restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't waste your time and money here,10,5 August 2016,"For the amount of money that I'm paying, I would have expected better quality than sakae sushi. Sake sashimi was not fresh enough, tako sashimi was served with head and mini tentacles (not with the usual big slices, which is a first for me). Grilled food were moderate but too salty. Garlic fried rice was fragrant but too oily. Salad was served with too much sesame dressing, the lettuce was dripping with dressing. The restaurant should get their portions right. The best dish here was the plain lettuce. I would not come here ever again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Always excellent experience!,40,4 August 2016,"This is my 2nd time back to this wonderful restaurant, the quality of the sashimi is fresh and not cut thin like other places, the other cooked dishes are well done too! Always my favourite for Japanese buffet!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very lacklustre ,20,4 August 2016,High on choice but low on quality for the lunch buffet. The sushi is probably the same quality of those served at Sakae Sushi. Definitely not worth the $34 price tag per head for the buffet. The chuka hotate has to be one of the worst I've ever had. Do note that water is charged at $0.50 at this restaurant. The buffet does not include tea or any dessert. Quite disappointing. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet,40,2 August 2016,"Sashimi was great! basically the menu was quite limited, pricing wise, 2 pax for close to 100 bucks.The service staff was alright, few of them spoke loudly in canto.There was also a bbq station, and of course there were burnt smell from time to time.Hope they can improve on the menu, some of their special dishes are ala cart, I mean, i'm paying so much, they can at least have one complimentary dish per person right?"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One of the best yakimono buffet for the price.,50,24 July 2016,"One of the best japanese grilled buffet for <$50. The sashimi is really fresh though the location is a bit of a pain to get to from the MRT stations. Could be noisy at times, especially during dinner. But do keep in mind that buffet does not include drinks and had to be ordered separately for a la cart price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good ala carte buffet. Sashimi was fresh but the maki needs improvement as the ratio of rice to ingredients is too high.,40,20 July 2016,Wide selections of dishes and good value for money. Staff were attentive. The only thing which needs improvement is the maki menu and composition.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food passable only,20,18 July 2016,"When I first entered the restaurant the female assistant manager didn't ask for my reservation but asked the guy behind me instead. When I flag out she was quite rude and said ""so what is your phone number ?"" That was bad attitude like I owe her. Food was ok but not great. Sashimi and sushi were quick but the rest like Gyoza and yakitori were really slow. I strongly recommend The Japanese buffet restaurant at Hotel Royal - much better quality. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Buffet Dinner with friends,40,14 July 2016,Nice foods n services. Will sure visit again. Hope That in future there will be more branch other than UE Sq. And hope to have 1 for 1 promotion.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Definitely Not Value For Money!!,10,11 July 2016,"Only the food photos on website looks good, but it is not. One of the worst Japanese ala carte buffet restaurant we (4 adults) have experienced. Website said ""authentic"" Japanese food, which I have my doubts! Our first and last visit. The price does not include the basic drinks i.e. water and/or green tea. Service is bad too. Chefs and waitresses speaks only Chinese, not that I have problem with Chinese, but this is just to highlight to visitors who are non Chinese speaking."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Perfect for group gathering,50,9 July 2016,"My friends and I had a private room to ourselves as there were 11 of us.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service,30,4 July 2016,The food is still up to standard but The service is not there thing we order is not here despite we requested many times
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sushi Buffet,40,4 July 2016,"The choices are quite a lot, and they suit our palate just fine, especially the pumpkin chawanmushi. The place is a little bit dim, but the service is swift & excellent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service needs improvement,40,3 July 2016,"Food was served very slow despite the place was not fully packed. My friends and I order grilled food and it took close to an 1 hour for the food to reach us. Some orders was not served as well, yet the server there told us it was already served. Need more improvement on customer service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety but don't expect any quality for this price,20,3 July 2016,"We paid $37++ for 2 (with a one for one promo) for a buffet lunch which was the most I would be willing to pay for the quality of the food here, especially when Robertson Quay is dotted with good quality Japanese restaurants all over. Sashimi - edible but not fresh. Beef and udon - tasted terrible, left them on the table. Chawanmushi was not bad. Yakitori sticks were really poor quality especially the chicken parts (gizzard, heart)... Probably stored frozen for a long time before they were served. My previous visit wasn't as bad as this one as I recall the sashimi used to be a lot fresher. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast and attentive service with awesome thick sashimi that I enjoy !really hoping for more credit card collaborations.,50,2 July 2016,"If you are a lover of thick fresh juicy sashimi, Shin Minori is definitely your kindda place ! Was using the entertainer app on an 1 for 1 promo thus it was a great deal .unlikely to go if there is no 1 for 1 though ..If I'm paying the full price , I would rather go hokkaido sushi restaurant which is also currently priced at $38 for ala carte buffet lunch "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice restaurant,40,30 June 2016,"Food is tasty, just they didnt included dessert in their buffet menu. And not so satisfied with the octopus sashimi."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Value Japanese Buffet,40,28 June 2016,"Wide range menu to choose from, Sashimi, sushi, handrolls, tempura, soups, pan fried, grilled items etc The sashimi platter had lovely slices of salmon belly, which I enjoyed. The garlic fried rice and cod roe spaghetti was superb! We presented the promo voucher and the restaurant gave us a big serving of Alaska snow crab nabe. It was delicious and fresh! Looking forward to going back to celebrate my birthday in August! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori,30,26 June 2016,"The only reason Shin Minori stands out is because of the bang for the buck! Their a la carté buffet is what makes it so special, at only 30-40 Singapore dollars per person. It's absolutely incredible for those who'd just love to stuff themselves up after weeks of sushi cravings! Service wasn't bad for a busy place, food definitely wasn't the best but it's just past satisfying! For a low budget sushi craze, this is exactly what you're looking for."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Japanese - a la carte,30,26 June 2016,"The sashimi such as tuna, salmon, sword fish, octopus are thick and fresh. Generally acceptable. But the rest of the food are just mediocre and nothing remarkable to talk about. Salads have too much dressing hence very saltish. Fried vegetables - cabbage too oily. Complimentary salmon fish are served too early even before all guests arrive. The buffet doesn't include drinks - even Japanese tea and water are chargeable. Even though tea can be continuously replenished, but need reminders to fill the teapots."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Standard is always there.,40,23 June 2016,Title says it all. They had maintained the standard of the food over the years since my first visit like half a decade ago.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food standard but poor customer service,30,20 June 2016,"This is my second visit to Shin Minori so I've decided to pen down (type down?) my review. Generally the standard of japanese dishes are quite alright. I have to mention some of my favourite/ must-order. Their seafood salad, pumpkin chawanmushi, yakitori electively, sushi selectively as well and garlic fried rice are quite good. What I am unhappy about is their customer service and/or servers attitude. The servers especially a lady in particular typically throw the dish plates onto our table and without saying excuse me while I was tucking in my food over my plates. It happened everytime she serves. This is an ala-carte buffet so you do expect that alot. There was practically no smile on their faces and that include their supervisor/captain if you would call that. The ambience was quite alright but table arrangement was cramp. Price for a weekend lunch buffet is about $40+ inclusive of taxes. Well, I was lucky to be using some promotion so I paid much lesser than that. To conclude, I would say if you are nearby River Valley and craved for some japanese buffet food... Consider trying them, if not I personally would not visit again for the price and service you will be paying for. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi not fresh,20,19 June 2016,"Over rating!
There are plenty choice of buffet to try if were to pay these range pricing.
The sashimi cut is thick enough.... However the food is not fresh and worth what we paid.
And the worst is I diarrhea after that meal..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful Experience!!,40,19 June 2016,Staff are very friendly & helpful. Service is pretty fast despite of the crowd. All my friends thank me for bringing them to such a wonderful restaurant that serve fabulous Japanese cuisine and fresh sashimi!! They even have the intention to bring their family next visit! I'll definitely recommend more friends there! I'll be back...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service,20,19 June 2016,Tablet menu don't work as we ordered a curry rice and didn't come despite telling the waiters a few times
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",chawanmushi having the smell of detergent smell in it.,20,14 June 2016,"We order 4 chawanmushi during our dinner. Eating half way my wife notice that there are some weird smell in it , so i get it from her and have a small taste on it .... to my surprise there are some detergent smell in it ,,,, immediately we ask the supervisor over for some explanation, to our surprise she just told us there are no smell in it and just take it back into the kitchen and just bring us another cup of it to us and ask us to try .... and tell us this is from the same tub. Frankly speaking we didnt bother to try that anymore and just keep quiet from there . But we are very sure we will never go back there any more and will tell our friends about this. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average food, Understaffed",20,13 June 2016,Food is of average quality. Rice used in sushi not real Japanese rice and of wrong proportions. Orders were frequently late or did not get served at all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth the price,50,13 June 2016,The food there is really fantastic. Recommend to reserve a seat in advance because it filled up quickly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh and Vibrant food,50,12 June 2016,The sashimi was very fresh and overall the selection of food was excellent. The quality of food was excellent.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor seats allocation,20,9 June 2016,"Well we booked a table for 2 pax through Chope but they did not receive the booking. When we got there, the restaurant was pretty empty and when we saw the table the waiter was bringing us, which was next to a wall and a table top acting as a partition from the next table; the neighbouring table was just right next to us.We asked if we can have another table near the windows to have a bit more privacy. The waiter said they were reserved. Throughout the whole night, nobody came for those tables. I just thought that since its a quiet Wednesday, the waiter should have given us a better table instead of lying to us that those table were reserved."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food Quality,40,7 June 2016,I have been to Shinminori quite a number of times. I find that the potato I ordered yesterday didn't taste as good as before. But the other food were all decent and nice.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,50,6 June 2016,Good food & good service. Very firm & fresh salmon. Worthy of wait. Better to reserve using Chope.com app
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Jap Restaurant,40,6 June 2016,"Awesome place to dine Japanese buffet. Free flow of Sashimi is fresh, ambiance is pretty good, food served is mostly fast. It is a bit pricey, and there wasn't wagyu beef."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad quality of food,20,6 June 2016,"Bad quality of food.
Cramped environment. Not advisable for family with more than 1 child.
Badly lit.
Service was mediocre.
Not advisable for big"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi is fresh and good. Unagi Don was good too.,40,5 June 2016,Will definitely go back again. Ordering are all through TAB which makes it very easy. But it will be good if there's exact photo of each item.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",meal at shin minori,20,31 May 2016,The tablet system in the restaurant is very poor. A few times the order we sent to the kitchen did not get registered. We had to keep ordering and spent a lot of time waiting. A waste of time. Will not go there again! Very disappointed
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointed,20,30 May 2016,"Went there for the first time and came out with disappointment. Was told that their online food order system is down. Given a piece of paper to write down our orders but the number of pens that are provided are limited. Eventually the customers next to our table lent us their pen. Waited for half an hour for the 1st dish to be served. The food are served very slowly. Almost waited for another half an hour for the 2nd dish to be served. The orders that we have made didn't turn up eventually and the dishes that we didn't ordered was served. Waitresses and waiters were dashing here and there panicky. Service can be better if the waiters and waitresses can be more polite when taking orders and acknowledge the customers' requests. Eg: I wanted to refill the hot green tea, the waitress came, listened to me and walked away without saying anything or nodding the head. Waitresses did bump into when they walked pass and they didn't apologized. When they are asked about the dish they are serving, the answers i got all the time is ""I don't know"" or ""I have no idea"". Food is so so. I'm pretty sure I can pay the same amount of money and get a better food and service in other japanese buffet restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food was great, service was quick. Satisfied",40,30 May 2016,The dining experience was great. Food was fantastic! The service was quite fast before it reaches 8 p.m. though it took close to an hour for me to get my refill of ice water :(
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worst dining experience!,10,30 May 2016,"The place was extremely noisy and there were drunkards shouting loudly but no service staff bothered to address that. Had to place my orders FOUR times but the food still did not arrive. Service was bad and we were not allowed to order additional Ala Carte food even though we are paying for that. Spent $165 for 2 servings of sashimi, 2 bowls of plain udon, 3 sets of sushi, 2 servings of vegetables and 4 chicken wings! The rest of the food never arrived. A most horrible dining experience ever!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",so-so only,30,27 May 2016,second time visit the outlet cos of the 1 dine 1 free promo...the slots are in 90mins blocks fixed so we cant choose our time to dine... my only issue is with the tako sashimi...its not the same as wats advertised...they served basically small whole tako...not those big n sliced up type...there are better restaurants to dine in this price range...n the place is quite cold for me...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Terrible Experience,10,27 May 2016,"Made a booking at 8pm and came earlier. Waiter mentioned that restaurant is fully booked and insisted to give us the counter seat. There were several empty tables around until 8pm. No table seats were given to us at 8pm, worse still the bbq counter caught fire, there were alot of smoke, no contingency plan to move us to other table, only after a good'o 15mins they decided to move us to an empty table.Over at the new table, electronic food transfer was not done properly and some of our food is missing. Period."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great sushi for a great price in expense Singapore ,40,18 May 2016,"Singapore has some amazing sushi places but they can be at amazing prices...Very expensive! This place has a nice atmosphere and good quality sushi. It won't be the best you ever had but certainly stands on its own. It is ""buffet"" style so you pay one price and order all you can eat. You order from tablets at the table. Super easy and efficient. I would recommend a reservation only because they put you near the kitchen on purpose without one...and we were the only ones in the restaurant!Good value and quality for the price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful Tonight!,50,13 May 2016,Food was really good and the sashimi was fresh! My three kids (six to nine) had a good time helping themselves to the sashimi and the yakitori. My wife and I had a good spread of the food available and also plates and plates of sashimi! Service was good as well and its definitely one of the best dining experience we ever had! Must return again! :) 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh food!,40,12 May 2016,"Food was fresh and arrives promptly. As it is a buffet, we are glad that they ensure the portions aren't too big so that we could taste and try more items. Ambience was fine as well - quite cozy and not too crowded on a Wed night. Service staff was helpful too. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Serving timing need improvement ,30,11 May 2016,"Visited on 11thMay2015 with my mother for lunch buffet,where I got an 1 for 1 as I using The Entertainer App. Reached 12pm.As my 1st time here so not sure,which I could ordered. Luckily, there was this lady,she guided me all the way and answered my many questions.Like its garlic fried rice,fried chicken chunks,potato salad,etc...Every items is in small portion,for example 1pc per serving. So when we ordered must take note of the serving size. And find the serving timing is slow,might be restaurant 95% full during lunch time.Overall, beside finding that they should speed up their serving time of each dishes as not only my table but others tables also waited quite long time. Another is their serving portion is too small but menu photo shown is like 2 or 4 per item. But can add on items without extra charge as is buffet. Will still visit as this 1 for 1 deal is great.Would like to compliment the lady wearing black blouse,she always stand at reception,she is patient to all my wonders. Spend $47.08 for 2 as I ordered hot green tea × 2=$3(no drink included in the buffet).The lunch buffet is $37 per pax before tax."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mother's Day Dinner,40,8 May 2016,"This is not our first visit to this resturant. Over the years they have been able to maintain the food quality. For a buffet, the food quality is good and decently priced. Sashimi is fresh and the food selection is quite varied. One of my ""must have"" is their garlic/pepper pork skewer. For groups they usually provide a Salmon fish head as complementary dish. A small nick pick, is that it is time to update their tablet ordering system. Which is a little klunky, slow and shuts down in mid order. Service is decent but not very attentive, but all in all a good family experience. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner,30,1 May 2016,First time there and according to Yahoo information it is top 20 Japanese restaurant. I doubt it as the foods provided is just average. Don't have the WOW factor. It is located in UE Square and the place is quiet on weekend.The restaurant is full house. The food is order via tablet with picture indicating your selection. The serving is a bit slow as it depend the numbers of customer ordering it. The chef will prepare those with many orders. Kimchi i also being served in this Japanese restaurant.I don't think I will recommend people to patronize the outlet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi served here,40,24 April 2016,"We had lunch ala-carte buffet here. Many varieties to choose from and we love their sashimi most. Very fresh Salmon, tuna, yellow tail, red snapper, etc.. others like takoyaki, grilled saba fish, salad, yakitori, were good as well. Food served to us fast & efficient. Can order in small portions which is good and you dont waste food. Staffs were friendly and helpful. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi,40,19 April 2016,"Went here the second time last night. It did not dissappoint. Sashimi as always was fresh and the portions were just like ala carte portions. Their robotayakis was impressive. Makis were just so so. Service was superb. They should check the tablets, they dont seem to work at the right moment. Over all i would recommend this place. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",JOKE RESTAURANT,10,13 April 2016,"We arrived at 09:15 and choose the buffet option, at 21:30 the kitchen closed but the waiter didn´t say anything about that, they only came with the bill and said ""pay and go we are closing"", we expected to get some refund some part but not they only say I´m sorry. So we had to go to other place a re-dinner because we were hungry. Besides the quality of the food is soo poor and the service is stressfull, they are not japanese they are chinese."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible dining experience,20,12 April 2016,"Asked for physical menu but never get it throughout my dinner (approx. 1.5hr). Not much variety to choose and food served extremely slow that we forgot what we've ordered. Taste wise, so-so. Some are too salty, some are too blend. Horrible. Would not recommend this place to others."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Rushed Service,30,10 April 2016,"Food was good; sashimi fresh and generous. Grilled items done well and crispy. However the handrolls were not well done. Seaweed was soggy. However do note that the buffet has 2 sessions. 1130-1pm and 1-230pm. They should make this known earlier. Also, the UOB 1 for 1 promo is only for 1 pax per table. This should also be made known earlier."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good service and good food,40,10 April 2016,"Went there using the 1 for 1 lunch redemption coupon. We were only given an hour to order our food. Despite this, the service was still fast n prompt. Sashimi were fresh!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing!,10,6 April 2016,"First impressions were bad when the Manageress took us to a cramped 2 seater table with a large partition blocking our view of the rest of the restaurant although it was early and the place was still empty. Ordered the buffet for 2 and fairly quickly received but can tell this food was pre-made in the kitchen. Edamame cold, chawanmushi cold, kimchi fried rice hot but it was taken out of oven coz bowl was baking hot. The sushi is the only saving grace of this place as sashimi and maki rolls are good standard. After that it was downhill once their EPOS ordering system broke down. No more food came out of the kitchen for over 45 minutes wait and table after table complaints. Manageress panicking and avoiding customers with no Plan B if something like this happens. This place failed tonight purely because of an over reliance on an ordering system and lack of contingency plan as well as weak management. One of the waiters can just laugh out loudly when it broke down and the Manageress in verbal panic mode. Seriously, you guys should not be in this business. We walked out after they offered that we did not have to pay for the bill."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad experience ,20,6 April 2016,"Very disappointed the moment we were sat on a miserable small table at 1 corner though we arrive early n the restaurant was still empty. We had buffet n every order took at least 20min to come which is quite ridiculous. Next problem the samsung pad ordering system was down and no one came to assist us til we manage to catch hold of 1 waitress to help us do manual ordering. I think the manager is doing a great job to lead the team instead trying to avoid customers to avoid problem?? I would definitely not reccomend any of my friends here, seriously is the worst Japanese restaurants I have been so far. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",not impressed,40,5 April 2016,"Shin Minori Restaurant what could I say, my first encounter not impressed with this establishment and I could honestly say that I had much better Japanese food elsewhere. Ordering thru a Samsung tablet which is neither friendly nor instinctive placed the restaurant on the cheap eat scale .Staff seemed pleasant and friendly and attentive. Frankly, the food lacked variety, and the quality of food was average with a run-of-the-mill taste. Certainly not worth the price charged. Very dissatisfied, I would not rush for a second return."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality japanese buffet. Excellent service.,50,5 April 2016,"Pleasant trip. Good quality food, excellent service. Staff are attentive, but would be good if they are clearer with the ordering tablet. No one brief us to submit the order, end up we waited in vain for 20 minutes as we thought our orders were already processed. Else, everything was good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Inconsistent and unpredictable, but usually good",40,24 March 2016,"This restaurant's ala carte buffet has an excellent selection of dishes at a rather reasonable price tag. The only problem is the standards that vary on different days of the week and sometimes even on the same evening.Most of the time, the sashimi is sweet and fresh - there was only one occasion where I thought the fish could have been fresher. The temaki selection is wonderful but wildly inconsistent - the same dish ordered a second time might not be as good as the first. If it's good, the seaweed is crunchy. The kabocha chawanmushi (pumpkin egg custard) is usually excellent with the right consistency, but if you're unlucky you will get a watery version. The Gyuniku Shogayaki is very tasty as is the agedashi tofu. If you can afford the cholesterol, try the Uzura Shioyaki (grilled quail eggs with salt). The tori teppan and Asari Shiru are also must -trys. The tempura is nothing to shout about, unfortunately. Despite the unpredictable standard, I'd still recommend this place as the dishes hit the spot most of the time. And the price is inexpensive, considering the variety."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Ok food, not worth the price, especially with the terrible service",20,13 March 2016,"Average japanese food. At the prices on their menu you would expect much better service. Instead, like a cheap diner, the customer has to order through a tablet. The tablet is not user friendly nor intuitive. My sister had an entertainment 2 for 1 sashimi voucher, which made the price affordable (but we still paid close to $80 in total for the two of us). We did have leftover food, but the restaurant refused to let us take this home unless we paid an extra $15 charge!!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Japanese food,40,12 March 2016,"With the promotional 1 for 1, it makes the buffet really value for money. The sashimi were good in general, most dishes were pleasant, nothing much to comment on negatively."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,40,9 March 2016,"Restaurant staff was friendly and attentive. Food also arrived within minutes after placing order. However, the tablet used for placing orders was having some problems and we had to wait quite a while before we could order. Other than this overall was a good experience"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fresh sashimi!,40,20 February 2016,"Sometimes, the kitchen missed our orders but its good if it 1 for 1! Have more promotions, please. Tks"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,30,19 February 2016,"Came here for lunch this week to try the lunch buffet. There's a reasonable selection of sashimi, sushi and typical Japanese dishes. Food quality was ok without being exceptional. Service was a bit haphazard and we had a few minor glitches with the Samsung tablets. Used the Entertainer app to get a 1:1 deal and at that price per person this represents reasonable value. Not sure I'd visit again at full price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Vday Dinner 2016,50,15 February 2016,"bought 3x Yu Sheng Promo from Shin Minori and their service left me a good impression and thought would take an opportunity to have a meal there.Since its Vday and my buddy is in town, I booked for a table for 4. As there were a crowd, we waited appox 5 mins for a table which is pretty expected. Welcome with a smile by the lady boss and after by service staff Gary. I guess my previous purchases have made it easier for me to reach out to them.The food was served without much delay and hot. The only issue I have was with the tablet, which was a little slow. The salmon sashimi were fresh and thick slices. I love the soft shell crabs. The dessert served that night was unique and delicious. At payment, we are handled a gift which is Jap Table Lamp. Place alittle busy that very evening and so I would also not penalise the lack of attention given. For the amount I paid for 3 adults and 1 child, I must said that we made it worthwhile. Would go back for dinner someday."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Out of the way, normal but yet pricey for that",20,13 February 2016,"We were looking for a place for a feast on 1st January 2016, New Years Day, I proposed going for Japanese food so we decided to give Shin Minori a try after looking around for Japanese food.We checked the price $39++ for dinner on public holiday, price seemed alright.We had alot of food but only the sahimi is of quality.At the end of our dinner, we were told that our dinner is $49++, we didn't question the bill much until now. Maybe Shin Minori can kindly address this discrepancy in pricing.Another thing is we waited for quite some time before our food arrived, given that the restaurant is almost empty.Thanks."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ended on Sour Note ,20,2 February 2016,"After a generally ok meal and experience, we had already paid and were walking about 50m away from the restaurant when one of the service staff shouted all the way from the restaurant door asking if we had paid. That was embarrassing and appalling on so many counts. Firstly, he could have asked his fellow staff first before shouting so loudly for everyone to hear, making it seem like we were evading our bill. Secondly, he could have come out to ask us face to face instead of shouting if he had wanted to clarify with us. Food wise, some were good some were average. Wide variety for the buffet, ranges from sushi to soba to rice and more. Service was generally ok and efficient enough. The restaurant uses a tablet for buffet ordering. Was going to give an Average rating until that appalling experience. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummy jap food!,50,25 January 2016,Efficient service and delicious food. Sashimi is fresh and wide variety of food available!Will go back again
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average or below average,30,14 January 2016,The price you pay VS the quality of food. sometimes it is just not justified. I have visited better restaurants. The service is bad. You can be waiting for 10 minutes or even longer and the staff would not have attended to you. Quality of food Vs the price is just not worth the stomach estate. I hope the work on the quality of food and service. considering that i is almost $42-45 per pax.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so dinner,40,3 January 2016,Food quality was good but lack of variety compare to other jap buffet need to look into the menu selection not too much pork selection and someone like beef nt much in menu. Green tea ice cream we order was nt so gd was too sweet at first we thought was jus a matcha ice cream but it come with sweet bean way too sweet for us personally. Overall service is normal during dinning in the one guy who lead us to the table I forgot to ask his name he was friendly n very helpful the rest I think need abit of training couldn't smile much. Anyway overall experience is so so if compare to other similar restaurants u way below them. Food service was good that the plus point. Hope my next visit will see a better selection. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",VERY AVERAGE,30,2 January 2016,"Went on new year's eve 2015. ""Choped"" a table for 2 with my husband. Restaurant did call the day before to confirm my reservation at 7.45pm. Service was not bad though my ice green tea-paid a dollar but refillable wasnt refilled till i asked but maybe cos it was pretty packed esp on ph eve so i m ok with it n the servers were pretty friendly too. But food is truly average not worth the $49++ per pax buffet - alot of sushi n few other items like fried tofu etc but frankly is it worth $49++?? Na...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet but read the fine print,40,29 December 2015,"All you can eat Japanese buffet is a good deal at $35 per person. Of course, come hungry! Portions are smaller than other Japanese places we visit. Also, watch the fine print. .. one order of sushi from the buffet "" looks"" like you will get two pieces but you only get one. Also if you don't eat everything you order, you get charged $10 per 100 grams. Make sure you eyes are not bigger than your stomach! By the way, ask for a table by the window... otherwise, it's very dark."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Like the buffet concept,40,29 December 2015,"Tried this Japanese restaurant based on the reviews. Had the all you can eat buffet. Pretty good deal if you are hungry!
I would come back if I am in the area!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",great sashimi and efficient service.,50,28 December 2015,"especially enjoyed the sashimi, both quality and quantity. sadly the all you can eat buffet did not provide drinks or dessert, not even simple ones, it would have been nicer. we still enjoyed hot green tea with an additional SGD $1. so not bad at all.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore,50,12 November 2015,We have been here countless times and still the number one Japanese restaurant at least for me and my friends. They always serve the freshest sashimi and high quality sushi..... and not expensive at all!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A perfect birthday meal,50,20 October 2015,"We went for a lunch buffet, the food was fantastic, an incredible selection and all very fresh. Unlike most buffets it is not sat around getting all dry and horrible, it comes fresh as you order so the food is lovely and hot when it gets to you. As an experienced eater of sushi, I can say the quality of the seshimi, maxi, handrolls and everything else isreally above adverage for what you would expect from an all you can eat.The staff were great too and on hand to help, were generally polite and well mannered. Thanks again, we will be back again! :)"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent a la carte buffet,50,28 September 2015,"One lowers his/her expectations if they go to an affordable a la carte buffet, but at Shin Minori, I was very pleasantly surprised to find really quality stuff, at unlimited amounts. They have a very wide spread and I enjoyed myself each time I visited. My only regret is when I step on the weighing scale the next day"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,40,21 September 2015,"Good food, good sashimi, decently fast service when it comes to serving your sashimi, unlike other restaurants.
Unfortunately, I find it a little too pricey. It cost almost 100 dollars (inclusive of GST and service charge) for just 2 person, for a weekend dinner."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place ,50,11 September 2015,"The selection of good available for the buffet is awesome, ranging from sashimi to grilled food. The sashimi here was fresh. They had no buffet counters. We had to order the food and it would be served to us, which is better as the food was prepared upon ordering."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi,50,5 September 2015,Sashimi was very fresh and thickly sliced! Hot/cold green tea available free flow at only $1. Nice ambience.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Eat all you can for SGD40!,50,12 May 2015,Many different varieties of Japanese food here. Sashimi and other raw fish are very fresh. The bbq grilled meats and mushrooms are also very good. We ordered close to 30 items for 3 persons! Service level at this restaurant was average. Do not expect anything more than bringing the food out to you and making payment. Every order was done via the Samsung tab. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Love the fresh buffet!,50,7 February 2015,"The food was fresh. The service prompt and friendly. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening (reservation) and then ordered through iPads. The food came quick, and quite fresh. I love salmon and the salmon here was very good, with just the right amount of fat. We also had the cheese scallop which was very good and recommended. I also like the atmosphere here which is very home-y and ""uncorporate"" feel which is good. Overall the value for this place is excellent! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Ala Carte Buffet!,50,27 December 2014,"wide range of selections! food are fresh and tasty!
reservation in advance is a must especially over the weekend or public holiday.
always love the sashimi and able to witness chef slicing them in front of you is amazing!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Above average food, below average service",30,4 December 2014,"I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and used their birthday promotion voucher. I brought along the email printout as the voucher stated which was actually required (I was lucky that I played safe instead of just using soft copy).The place is located at UE square which would require about 20 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT. But I would highly suggest wait for bus 54 just outside the Central. The ride will take at most 5 minutesThe food is above average. I especially like the sashimi moriwase and you can tell the difference from the quality of sashimi in cheaper restaurants such as the popular Sushi Express. The only horrible tasting food is probably their cold pumpkin dish. I also like that we can order from their tablet instead of having to call the service staff. This definitely helps reduce the service time and inconvenience of calling the staff. It will be helpful if the system could help tracked which order has been fulfilled, especially I usually order a lot in one goThe main issue lies with the service. There were only a few customers (3 tables occupied) during the time I was taking my birthday lunch, but it took me effort (at one point I almost have to shout) to get the attention of the staff. The staff lacked smiles also especially when we proceed with our payment.The boss definitely needs to train his staff in terms of service quality or else they will lose more customers. Singapore is a country where service buys you more customers compared to food quality when it comes to more expensive foodI would come back if there is another cheap promotion, otherwise at its default price, it is not really worth it due to their below average service quality and not so convenient location."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",All you can eat? Yes please,40,23 November 2014,"Listen, it's an all you can eat Japanese buffet, ordered a-la-carte, for $40 SGD excluding drinks, taxes, and service. I think it's great, the quality of food is better than good, but not great, but again, what do you expect? We enjoy the tuna and salmon sashimi, miso soup, seaweed salad, tempura prawns and vegetables, chicken wings, and some of the chargrilled meats. If you go in with the right set of expectations, you won't be disappointed, you might actually even like it... I sure do."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reasonable place ,40,15 November 2014,"If you are really hungry but dun want to spend so much money for Japanese, this is the place! Quality of sushi is just fine. Service was good and fast... surprisingly. I will go back with friends to have beer or sake and lots of sushi. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Typical average Japanese buffet place,20,22 October 2014,"Heard it's good so gave it a try. Ordered soft shell crab, the most pathetic I've ever seen, is so small! Is about 2cm in length. Ordered sashimi octopus, is ridiculously tiny too!

The tempura ebi was nicely fried.
The clam miso soup was excellent.
Nice ambience"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",cheaper does not mean better,30,31 August 2013,decided to give this place a try but only managed to get seats after 2 failed occasions...single portion was too much. 2 ala carte grilled salmon steak n u are more or less full...the tako sashimi is not the type we would normally eat at other jap restaurant...from the slices u can tell the octopus is very small...every cut is estimated half a tentacle cant achieve the chewy taste...rest of the sashimi wise is ok. service was ok just tat we need to write our order on various categorized color menu slips. which is not very environmental friendly and its marked by pen.and its quite cold in there..
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was real good but don't expect service,40,4 July 2013,"This is probably one of the bestJapanese a la carte buffet that I ever dine in Singapore. Order as much as you like. Excluding drinks and alcoholic beverages. Approx $40 inclusive taxes per person.Must try items - sashimi menu, prawn tempura and curry udon.I would rate this restaurant very good experience.The Service wasn't attentive and waitress always forgotten what order. Not paying attention to table. Fail to top up green tea. This probably because we have more than 20 persons. Service and attention to details must be consistent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese restaurant,30,27 February 2012,"Japanese restaurant offering an extensive menu at a reasonable all-in price. Diners are given 4 types of order forms to indicate their choices of raw seafood items, grilled dishes, etc. They can send additional orders thereafter. Desserts are available -- with an additional charge! We found the service good at first, but slower and less efficient as the restaurant became more crowded. Sashimi choices are rather limited, fresh-tasting and generally good in quality but not in presentation. Ambience and decor are satisfactory."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value Japanese all-you-can-eat buffet,40,24 September 2011,"I have patronised Minori for a number of years now and have always found their food to be good value for money. The quality is above average and the service is acceptable, considering that each person expects to pay about S$50 nett for all you can eat sashimi. If you are looking for a place to pig out on Japanese food staples, this is the place for you."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hit and Miss Chaat But Awesome Dal Khichdi,40,15 October 2018,"Somehow Kailash Parbat's outlet in Little India doesn't get any reviews - people are perhaps posting their reviews on the other outlet. Nonetheless, this place is supposed to be your go to place for Chaat even in the streets of Little India where there are so many other options. We went there on our first night itself thinking that if we liked the place we could eat here often during our 5 day stay. But sadly we never returned because we were not completely satisfied. For starters we ordered a Sev Puri (SGD 7.5 +) and Ragda Dahi Puri (SGD 9+). The Sev Puri was spicy and delicious just like you would get in India. But the Ragda part of the Dahi Puri turned out to be disappointing - it was bland and basically boiled chickpeas - completely without flavour. We didn't eat more than half the dish and decided to order main course (which we hadn't planned to) - Daal Khichdi (SGD 12+) - which was the hero of the day. Piping hot and just how they taste in local Mumbai restaurants - it was absolutely delicious.The service was prompt. They were also kind enough to see that our kid was not enjoying the chaat and gave him a complimentary bowl of muri and namkeen mixture. Rates are slightly on the higher side for the chaat but would have been worth it if the flavours were right. A 34 SGD bill for 2 chaats and a single main course is one of the more expensive tabs you will pay in Little India."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",the food is good but service extremely poor,30,29 August 2018,"As I entered the restaurant I was escorted to my table and served with water.the person who came to take the order was least bothered and was busy chit chatting with another client. We ordered our food first we received a dish that was not for us. He placed the platter and then apologized saying it was not for us. he again said it was for us, we checked and told him it wasn't then again he apologized. (was a very casual apology though). After a few minutes again he got us some food which was not hours and again we told him and then he went to another table. and finally our food arrived. The taste was good, nothing great but good food. The juice came flat and we had to tell him to get ice. normally they should ask while ordering. When we left again no smiles. above all this the restaurant had around 100 people capacity but there were only 8 guests including us so imagine this mess with 4 serving staffs. imagine with more clients. finally we went out and ate a busy food joint which was ananda bhavan trust me had great food !!! There is another restaurant called gokul which is also a good indian restaurant nearby"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian chaat in singapore.,50,28 August 2018,"They have 3 outlets in Singapore, I visited two of them and both are good.They have a huge variety in Chaat like bhel puri, paani puri, pao bhaji etc.North Indian and south indian is also good.loved the royal falooda.Almost all staff is indian and they also speak Hindi.Prices are also reasonable a family of four had starters, chaat , main course and desserts all for some 65 singapore dollars."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",At times very good .... average at times,40,30 January 2018,"We frequent this outlet next to the Temple in Little India and have realized that this place doesn't believe in consistency. At times their puris are stale and have a very strong stale oil aftertaste, at times the yoghurt in the dahi puri is too sour, at times their chole is bland missing the basic spices and seasonings, at times the sandwiches are inedible. Their lunch/dinner menu tells the same story. Unreliable. But the last time we were there, we were in for a treat! the pani puri puris weren't stale, chole was delicious and the paneer tikka sandwich was excellent. Everything was yummy and delicious. In fact we even told the lady who took our order about the good food and the previous letdowns. All the best!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian veg restaurant,40,29 January 2018,Clean and good taste Indian veg restaurant. No meat dishes at all. Indian sweets are also quite good.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Yum! ,50,28 January 2018,"We visited Kailash Parbat for a family dinner during our vacation to Singapore. We went there primarily as it was a vegetarian restaurant. The ambience is just about good and located in Little India were competing options are available. We had kids and ordered for Paneer kofta, roti, dal and jeera rice. The kofta was excellent and the tandoori roti was just about perfect. The service was superfast. A little pricey, but worth the wonderful experience and taste, expect about 25SGD per person at least. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Most delicious Indian food,50,23 January 2018,"I went there for lunch with family. We had chola bhatura, paneer butter masala and tandoori roti. Paneer was so yummy. Will surely visit again."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Meh! Overpriced, unhealthy & lousy customer service",10,6 January 2018,"This used to be a good restaurant, however of late its fallen into decline. The waiting staff don't really seem to understand how food is to be served, for example if a soup and a naan bread are the only thing that is ordered by a customer. Then bring them together.. Not bring the soup first and then leave the customer with just a naan to eat.. Such nuances are not understood.I suppose this is a rather big ask from a restaurant that claims to have a worldwide presence.The food served is unhealthy and excessively oily and over priced,.several hawker centers dish out better options in Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",awesome food,50,4 January 2018,"one f d best restaurant in little india...nice ambience...v had chole bhature ,parathas n vada pav....al were good...vl definetly recommend all indians to visit dis resto"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic chaats and snacks,40,7 December 2017,"This branch of Kailash Parbat just opposite to the famous Mustafa Centre seems perennially crowded. It's also cramped , with tables in close proximity. If you brave these inconveniences...there's no further disappointment. In the group we tried Alu tikki chaat, dahi poori, veg noodles and the eternal favourite chole bhature. All the items were tasty, authentic and the rushing waiters attentive and quick. The chaas to wash down the spices and oil was comforting too. The tab was reasonable. A big tick for me...any time...and there is so much more to try too!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat Paradise,30,4 December 2017,Kailash Parbat is authentic and Keeping good Indian food. Its was really enjoyed to ate Indian veg food. I like very much Cutlet and Pav Bhali its was so Delicious.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good and expensive food!!,40,10 November 2017,"I had a Sev Puri and a cold coffee. The taste for the sev Puri was quite good and the cold coffee was also refreshing.
I only thought that the pricing was a bit too much for what they are serving in Kailash Parbat."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great food but costly,40,8 November 2017,"The food here is good, I would expect people to come here for North Indian cuisine.Food quality is good, options are aplenty & the head waiter is very courteous. We had food there about 3 times during our stay and the cost worked out to be approximately 50 SGD per couple (2 adults and 1 child) per meal. That is costly considering that we averaged 50 SGD for two couples per meal at just about every other place.Go there for a change and be ready to be left with just that in your pockets :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste of India in Singapore! Good food!!,50,8 November 2017,"It was a solace to have found one of my favorite eateries in Singapore. It is conveniently located along the famous Little India - Belilios Road. We had the delicious Pav Bhaji, taste of which transported us to the famous khao-gallis of Mumbai. Recommendations - Pav Bhaji, Paneer Sabzi, Masala Dosa. I did have one concern, they do not provide fresh pickle tubs, they will simply pass over a pickle tub used from another table. Staff also need to wear smiles on their faces. When we placed our order the waiter was behaving as if he was doing us all a big favor. Please note that most of the food served here is not fresh, it's pre-prepared and continued."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Food in Singapore,40,8 November 2017,Restaurant is clean and staff is courteous. The quality of food - Chats is good and of Mumbai Style. North Indian food (Punjabi style) is good. The quality of foods is more than expectation in a foreign country.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Superb Indian food,50,31 October 2017,we had amazing Indian food ....we had Fried rice & Manchurian which was perfect Indian Taste ..we also had Punjabi which was superb too.....one can blindly order any thing i am sure you will get proper taste.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bit costly,40,26 October 2017,A bit costlier. Alternate place if you are tired of South Indian food. Food was good. Had my first experience that waiter will not serve food unlike in India. Also the items you order will arrive at the same time. There will not be any time interval . they will place the order on the table and leave.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian Food,40,25 October 2017,"We had KP Platter Chaat, Samosa Chaat and the best of all was Koki, we loved it very much and will recommend strongly for Koki (its a Sindhi item but excellent taste and I am quite sure every Indian will love it, it is served with a bowl of curd). I would definitely like to mention that the restaurant is little expensive as compared to its counterparts in the vicinity offering Indian food but still one should try it out at least once."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good. Same as one in India. Slow service,40,22 October 2017,"The kailash parbat at singapore is able to maintain quality similar to the one they provide in India. However service very very slow.
Overall good experience."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Poor service, decent food",20,24 September 2017,"Made the mistake of stopping by at this location. While the food is fine, I would recommend going to their other location on Serangoon Rd. Much better ambience and service. We always go there with friends. At the Syed Alwi outlet, they first gave me a table and then made me move because “the group wants this table.” Turns out they wanted to give my table to five tourists. Don’t think I will be going back to this location ever again. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian love,50,22 September 2017,Best one for indian vegetarian options. Chaat is awesome. Always crowded. Wait is worth. Pani Puri make you remember of mumbai. The food is best!!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent food!,40,21 September 2017,Great place for chat (Indian snacks) coupled with good service. my favorite is Samosa Chat. Little expensive than surrounding restaurents and worth the quality.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic food and Great Service,50,10 September 2017,"Went to eat out at the restaurant with high expectations which were met easily ! Located in Littke India area, offers good authentic north indian food , suitable for family and friends outing. The ambience and environment is very good. Mushroom matar curry which is not on the menu is brilliant, highly recommended."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very std but still a decent choice..they need to just push a little hard,30,3 September 2017,"I have been to Kailash Parbat a few times. So it means its not bad and you can repeat it, but then its also pretty std stuff and what you want you need to know.Their chole bhatura platter is very good. So are their chaats. But they are pretty pricey. This time I tried their north indian food and I came away unimpressed.We ordered Garlic nanns, which even when hot have a a rubbery texture. They definitely need to look at their flour preparation. We order shaahi paneer and it was white gravy based which is wrong, no issues, the gravy is fine, not great, but its the paneer that kills it. Its not at all soft. This is a shocker. There are many places in singapore that serve very soft paneer , why cant they get it. I am sure their own chefs would admit this is not the kind of paneer that works.On top of it their rates are significantly high. for these rates I woudl rather go to another restaurant that serves much better north indian cuisine. so its a ok and decent place if you know what to order. but nothing great about it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food but slow service,40,25 August 2017,Kailash Parbat restaurant located at Little India is a good place if you are looking out pure vegetarian Indian food. Serves a very good variety of Chats . However the service needs a little improvement as it is a bit slow. Otherwise it was a overall good experience
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food and Good Ambience,40,21 August 2017,Visited on 19 Aug 17. The restaurant has good ambience. The Indian food was excellent and better than many upscale restaurants in India. The service was prompt and courteous.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Chaats OK, rice items a BIG No No",10,10 August 2017,"Have been couple of times to have chaats, which is Ok. One of the visits, ordered Fried Rice. It was too oily. So next visit I specifically asked for less oil in my rice. I was in for a shock, the most oiliest biryani I have ever had. Did point it out to the lady in charge, who defended it saying there was no extra oil added. We already had a tiring day, was in no mood to argue with someone who was not ready to correct. We just left the food , paid the bill and exited. The manchurian starter was over fried. Will never step in there again as they lack basic customer service."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,50,27 July 2017,An amazing indian food in singapore. Love the restaurant. Good and friendly staff. Very nice experience. Must Visit
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Finally Ceavings Satisfied,50,24 July 2017,"While cravings were lingering ard unsatisfied, chanced upon the restaurant while driving pass. Decided to drop in to have Pani Puri. To add on had few more items which were worth trying. Must try dishes will include Sev Puri n Dahi Puri (my fav). Even the drinks were gd, coffee had nice aroma n taste, tea was equally good and Lime Soda which was refreshing. A definitely ""wanna go again"" place."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","An average experience, food is good ",30,19 July 2017,"We went to KP, Little India, Singapore, as we were missing biriyani a lot! We arrived early to avoid waiting. We managed to slip in n get the last available table. The place was really narrow n linear, n cramped up, hesitantly rundown too.. It was extremely noisy, the place was definitely understaffed. The staff was running around, why n where is difficult to comment as public seated on each table was looking disgusted, unattended n disappointed. The food really arrived late, it was delivered to three of us at three different timelines. Food was good with KP standards, die to which I'm giving it 3 stars. Get in here only if you are looking for food 'on the go'. Avoid it completely if you're looking for fine dines or special evenings! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome genuine veg snacks,50,16 July 2017,"Most genuine veg snacks like papdi chat , paneer tikka, samosa , seekh kabab veg available . Main course is awesome too. Located just opposite to Mustafa complex gate 2. The place inside is little congested. Suggested them to offer wifi access to tourists."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bet you cant stop licking your fingers !,50,16 July 2017,"Best Taste !Good Service !A Vegetarian Delight !One of the best Restaurants in Singapore. Never miss if you are in Singapore.Very popular with the local Indians as well as tourists, so one may need to wait a bit to get your table,especially in the evening. And the wait a get a little longer during weekends.But the wait is worth every minute.A bit expensive compared to other Indian restaurants ,but the taste and quality of the food served compensates for it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",First and Best! ,50,15 July 2017,For someone who enjoys pure vegetarian food this is the place! Bit expensive conpared to other Indian restaurant in Singapore but the food quality is awesome. Anyone who wants a pure vegetarian dinner can't afford to miss this place.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Absolutely lip smacking food but service and cleanliness need improvement,40,12 July 2017,"You will get very, very tasty food at Kailash Parbat - Syed Alwi outlet. Absolutely lip smacking. Veg Chilli Milli with Masala Kulcha, Chole Paneer Bhatura and gulab jamun with rabri are my all time favourites here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Horrible place, bad services, overpriced food",10,10 July 2017,"Can't express my disgust enough without being outraged. We had really bad experience, not once or twice but 3 times. 1st time in the branch opposite Mustafa - we ordered food, waited for 25 mins, they didn't serve despite repeated reminders. Funny enough, people who came after us, ate n left, but we were still not served. Finally we gave up after 30min, and manager said ""oo we forgot your order, plz wait for a few min, we will serve"". Imagine the audacity manager had to ask us to wait another 15-20 min.2nd time in the main branch on Serangoon road - history repeated itself. Can't imagine the same thing happened again!!! But this time, i was prepared to pick a bone with manager. Finally, after 3 reminders and 25 minutes later, we were served cold curry n uncooked naan. And look at the hight of shame, manager first refused to speak with us, and finally when i spoke, he wasn't even apologetic.3rd time, again at Opp. Mustafa branch - I honestly didn't want to go in this place with pathetic service, but we had to go as the group of friends decided to go there. Substandard food was served, my friends ate it, I decided to wait and go to other place.I know my review wouldn't make a big difference as there are only a handful places serving vegetarian North Indian food, but plz do look for alternatives before choosing this place. Perhaps give a try to Panchtantra or Bikaner. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent indian food,50,30 June 2017,"The best indian food in little India. After a long tiring day; you crave for a good heavy meal and Kailash Parbat is a place to go. It gets little waiting during night but its worth.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The Indian street food at its best!!,50,7 June 2017,"Love going to restaurants which proudly showcases the real and authentic dishes and reflects the popular culture of India and thus instantly fell in love with Kailash Parbat. Kailash Parbat has several stores in India and overseas. I have been to their Mumbai store several times and just love it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the menu is simply great – vast and offers everything from north Indian food to south Indian food to Indian street food to Indian sweets. The Masala chole bhature was the best I have had in years (my 1 year toddler even gobbled up few bites and was wanting more), and the Papri chaat was so so wonderful – just perfect – full of flavours. They also serve authentic sindhi cuisine – yumm dal pakwaan – very few places in the world which serves sindhi food. I might have to move to Singapore just to be able to eat here more regularly or visit Singapore more often!The price was cheap and the food was delicious and flavourful. The staff were lovely and attentive too. You are not likely to find better Indian food, certainly not at the price, anywhere in Singapore. Kailash Parbat is about authenticity and keeping it real- real good Indian soul food. My top 5 favourite dishes at KP are Pav Bhaji, Masala Chole Bhature or the Bhature Platter, Chaat Platter, Papdi chaat and their selection of lassi’s. "

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Unhappy With the Taste,30,28 May 2017,Went there little early in the evening.Had a high expectations from the food because we tried earlier other outlet which is near to Mustafa.Ordered Gobi Manchurian. It came out to be Gobi Pakora style stuff (coated with lots of flour) which was awefull in look and wasteful in taste .Then we ordered Pani Poori . Not bad - StandardLater we decided to try Bhatura. Which was ok but not too good.Since Start was bad and mood was spoiled with Gobi Manchurian this we decided to stop there and could not order main course .Little pricy and could not find worth it for the starter quality.I might not visit this place again because there are a lot of places nearby which gives better taste.

As a non-vegetarian, this has made me realize that vegetarian food can be excellent (I have been to many vegetarian restaurants that made me glad I was non vegetarian because of how bland the food is). Kailash Parbat was different and exceeds my expectations. I find myself returning here frequently. I especially love their Hyderabadi Briyani."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Outstanding Indian Food!!! A must visit place for all :),50,25 February 2017,"Ambience - One of the very important things which anyone considers before going to any place, Kailash Parbhat at Imperial Hotel, sets the perfect tone for good lunch or dinner with your family and freinds!Food - This place is the one to go for any vegetarian north indian and indo-chinese cuisine! They also serve Jain food on request. The best part is that they have maintained the same taste of all their dishes which they originally started from India. Their speciality is chaat items specially Dahi Puri, Pani Puri, Chole Tikki ( The best in Singapore). Indian Chinese is the best so are their main course dishes. I personally like their Biryani. Since this chain of hotels is owned by a Sindhi, all Sindhi Delicacies are served on a Sunday!!! Trust me they are simply mouth watering and come with the same taste!!! In desserts their Kulfi Falooda and Jamun-e-Jannat (Rabri with Gulab Jamun) are something to die for!!!Service - Outstanding! Hope it sums it all.Price- Price is simply perfect. Approximately 40-50S$ for a 2 couples is a good value for money for some great quality food, ambience and service.A must visit for all Singaporeans and tourists from across the Globe!!!!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",From my recent visit I dont think it offers good North Indian Taste!!!,20,17 January 2017,"Ragda Patties was lousy and quite cold.. no energy. Club sandwich was another disappointing experience -- in fact this was one of good item they served earlier at Syed Alwi Road. But over this place it was horrible --- the potato in the sandwich was without any masala / taste.Overall I strongly recommend the restaurant owner to improve on North Indian food / taste, food should be tasty -- have some energy!"

Please try not to visit the loos as this sight will ruin your health for minimally one week"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bad food ,20,25 December 2016,"The interior of this place is really nice. Unfortunately, the food was really bad. The manchow soup tasted more like Manchuria gravy, far too spicy and garlicky. The jhalfrezi was sweet, the daal makhani too watery. The only thing that tasted good was daal tadka. The quality of the food has been consistent, it was just as unsavory the last time I dined here. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lovely Indian food,50,16 December 2016,"Very authentic, service is amazing...can't go wrong if you are looking for North Indian...been here few times now."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian restaurant ,50,4 December 2016,My husband was worried because he doesn't believe a meal can be a meal if it has no meat. We did not realise it was vegetarian until we sat down. With the help of the waiter we ordered our meals and were pleasantly surprised with some of the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The restaurant also looked a lot more modern than surrounding restaurants in little India.

I know that their food is good - have eaten at the outlet on Serangoon road near the temple - surely much better.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",TASTE OF INDIA,40,25 October 2016,been there 2 years ago. Situated in Little India this place was heaven for me. They serve great Food at their prices. Not very cheap not very expensive. Food is great. Service is nice. Ambience is great. Visited this place almost everyday during my visit to Singapore. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Poor service and serve half cooked food,20,23 October 2016,"I visited with my family to Kailash Parbat after reading reviews on trip advisor. But my experience was totally opposite We ordered Channa Bhatura. It came after 40 minutes. The chana was also hard and half cooked. The service is so slow that when we ordered extra bhatura, they took 20 minutes to deliver. Not happy at all with the service and also ambience. The ambience is also very dingi. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian restaurant in Singapore,50,22 October 2016,As a family tour we came here and as usual wanted onky Indian food could satisfy our hunger!!Kailash parbat is best in town and really every night for 10 days we came here and enjoyed a lot!!Very very delicious home like food was served and we were satisfied each and every time! A real value for money
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bad service,20,20 October 2016,"Was disappointed with the service. Had to request for everything from sugar to tissues..when asked to pack, the extra food, it was done hurridly as a result of which most food(bread sandwich) gt soaked in chutney when I reachd home"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Stale, bland and Poorly made",20,19 October 2016,"Very disappointed. The chaat items we ordered - papdi chaat, sev puri and ragada sev puri - all ingredients (especially the fried items like boondi and papdi) tasted stale and old. I have eaten at this place several times over the last 5 years and the quality of food has plummeted. DO NOT EAT HERE. Costly and horrible food. Service is only decent thing about the place. The staff is prompt. We also ordered Gobi Manchurian (no taste, pieces too big so undercooked) and fried rice (too oily, bland, cheap vegetables)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best indian vegeterian food in singapore,50,15 October 2016,"Almost all menu items are good to try. Price is on higher side but worth it. Service is great. I have been visting for 2 years, was never disappointed. Must visit if you are indian vegeterian."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible Terrible Terrible Food,10,14 October 2016,"I heard so much about this place and I went here when it first opened (and even recently), the ""authentic"" food that they describe in the menu is not really authentic and it's really pricey. Did not like any of the food and I ended up leaving more than half the dishes I ordered. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Sindhi food at its best,50,13 October 2016,"Excellent food
Flavourfull
Hot and spicy
Felt like home Indian food
Buzzing atmosphere with some soft music
Very friendly service
Would recommend to everyone"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent dinners ,40,8 October 2016,It was really a wonderful experience to have veg food ...lil bit on costly side but still as the food is good so makes it worth it ...one should definately try with family and kids for authentic Indian veg
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place to have delicious vegetarian food in little India ,40,8 October 2016,"Visited restaurant located in little India Singapore for dinner and lunch. Food including starters of Chaat is tasty, hygienious and delicious.
Chaat, Cholle Bhature, Dal Makhani, Gulab Jamun every thing was just yummy and authentic Indian ."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good north indian food and great service,40,5 October 2016,"We try the palak paneer (which also has methi, so unique taste) and chana masala with sindhi chapati (Chana Bhatura is the main favourite there, but we choose the healthier option!) and it's been consistent in its taste. The Dal and Jeera rice are also good. We have tried their Falooda's and they are tasty too. Chandradeo and Jyoti are always smiling and provide very good service, so we have been going there a number of times lately"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaats and Kulfi Falooda!!,30,4 October 2016,"Great location near Mustafa, an easy stagger to this vegetarian Sindhi joint after an afternoon of fighting the scrum in Mustafa. The service is average however this is ideal for those looking for a refreshing Chai, Snacks and recovery after an energy sapping session at Mustafa next door. The Paani Poori and Paid Chaat hit the spot and the Kulfi Falooda was a hit with the kids. My eldest pronounced it the best Falooda she has ever had!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good option for North Indian food,40,2 October 2016,Had been there recently during my stay in Singapore. One of the better North Indian restaurants in Little India.The chat items and Chole Bhature were good.I suppose it needs to improve on its North Indian dishes as the neighbouring Panchatantra is gonna give it run for its money...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Vegitarian yummy,40,29 September 2016,"The best Bhel Puri I have ever eaten. This is a low key restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Good service and easy surroundings make for an ""I'll be back "" restaurant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mediocre food with slow service and noisy environment,20,22 September 2016,We had a family lunch at this restaurant a few days ago. The service was slow and it was a pain getting the attention the service staff. The Hot and Sour Soup ordered tasted only of corn flour and the 2 'Panner' or Cottage Cheese North Indian dishes tasted and looked and same. The restaurant was noisy and unkept with dirty floors. I am not going back here for sure. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food vegetarian restaurant.,50,20 September 2016,"It's a good restaurant.Pure vegetarian as well as we got jain Punjabi food also.Restaurant internal décor is superb.It's big & spaces Soups , Punjabi sabji variety, & all food taste is great.Staff & services is great.Don't miss to eat at this place as a Tourist."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Place in Singapore to have Sindhi & Chat items,50,15 September 2016,"Staff well received, near to little india, please order Pavbhaji, Pani-puri, Sevi Puri and in last Kulfi without fail.....One of the best place for Chat items"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The restaurant was ok as food food and rude staff members,30,11 September 2016,"Staff remembers talk very rudely and do not give atuff like spoons,however food was well and good to eat"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent Service,Not that Tasty food",30,6 September 2016,"We went for Dinner on Ganesh Chaturthi. Place was crowded but we were promptly given seats.Service was excellent, very prompt and accomodating as one member ordered Jain food.Foodwise its disappointing, atleast based on what we ordered this time. Soups were tasteless (Hot n Sour, and Sweet Corn). Aloo Chat was bland in taste too.Hyderabadi Veg biryani was a big disappointment. Paneer ke Soole (Grilled Cottage Cheese) and Chinese fried rice was ok to some extent.Didnt try the Dessert."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Comfort. Food.,40,4 September 2016,"I have eaten here six times in the last three years. When I visit Singapore I try a lot east Asian food, but after a few nights of eating with chopsticks, this Punjabi has to have some North Indian food and eat with his hands. The menu is very extensive, but I have only tried four things: samosa chaat; pani puri; chole + masala bhatura; ras malai. It's what I crave: comfort food from childhood. Maybe next time I will try something else. They do all of them very well. Restaurant is very clean and bright compared to most of the Indian restaurants in Little India. I will be back next time."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian fare ,40,29 August 2016,"After a long trip and trying out different food, felt like Indian veg food. Replica of the Indian Kailash Parbat with the same menu. Began with Sev Puri and then tried the chole and kulcha accompanied by raita and papad. Tends to get crowded due to the Indian area and visitors but quick turn around of people. Must try. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the best indian food,50,27 August 2016,"Kailash Parbat does not makes you fell you are away from Home. Its located bang opposite Mustafa. Things to try Pav Bhaji, Biryani and KP special chat"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian veg food,50,21 August 2016,"I am very late to post but must say this was god send for veg Indian family. We ate for 6 days out of 7 days. Amazing food, service and ambience. Thank you for making our trip memorable"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Noisy, poor & disinterested service and bad food.",20,17 August 2016,"We ordered two fizzy drinks, a coffee, two entrees, two mains and a naan.The entrees were plain and uninteresting. Spice dusted dry potatoes with day old chopped coriander on top. Blergh. One drink (sparkling mineral water) didn't turn up so we asked for it again and got a room temperature bottled still water. Sent that back and ensued a long and boring conversation about what sparkling water is. We decided not get no fizzywater at all (there was tap water on the table already), and 5 minutes later a lime sparkling lime drink turned up (yep, one we specifically said we didn't want). The waitress honestly didn't give a rats, hardly listening the first time and not taking the time to get it right.Nowhere does it say that this is a VEGETARIAN restaurant so I've just saved you 10 mins trying to find a chicken dish on the menu. The curries we ate for dinner were quite nice - good temperature (both spice wise and temperature wise), and good portions. The naan was ok but not the best.You can see the hand washing basin to the toilets from the dining room which is a bit weird. And there is a bizarre combination of English and non-english on the menu so we could hardly work out what the dishes were. The restaurant was full of families with noisy kids so I definitely wouldn't recommend it after a long flight. Locals may love this place once they know what their favourite dish is, but it's not suitable for tourists."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great vegeterian Punjabi Food Outlet,50,17 August 2016,"We order only the following types of dishes here, the most authentic Punjabi styled preparation in Singapore - varieties of mouth watering ""chole bhature"" and awesome ""chaats"""
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian cuisine,30,13 August 2016,Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa has a good ambience and the service is good. The place gets busy on weekdays after 12 pm. Lot of families drop in with kids. Thete is a good selection of North Indian cuisine. They offer a diverse range of Sindhi dishes and chaat. The restaurant was clean and the air conditioning was doing a good job on a hot and humid day.I tried their Chana Bhatura with sweet lassi. The meal cost SGD 18 bucks with taxes. The chana bhatura consists of 2 non oily medium sized bhaturas. The chana was average as I was expecting the chana to have more interesting flavours and aroma. The sweet lassi was very good and not diluted with water that is commonplace at most joints in the Little India area. Those on a tight budget or looking for value for money are probably better off exploring other joints.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very average food and terrible service,10,9 August 2016,Thought of having snacks and tea so went there to a known place I have visited for years..this time round it was a public holiday and the place was not crowded at all..asked the staff about an item in the menu and he said it's written there just see it yourself! Each item took forever to arrive and it didn't taste as good as it used to.. Even their famous paani puri has become terrible! Staff were walking around and didn't pay attention when I call them..after the first dish everything took forever to arrive...tea wouldn't have arrived if I didn't remind and it was not even hot... Overall a big disappointment and won't bother going back there again!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Not so good food... Poor service,20,9 August 2016,The service was poor... Food taste is so so. We ordered Ali go hi which was very bland and not cooked properly. Roti tori was so cold. Butter milk very watery.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",tasty north-indian vegitarian food,40,2 August 2016,"It has become my most favorite Indian vegetarian restaurant over couple of years, it is bit pricy due to the quality of the food they serve. It is best place for chat (paani/dhahi/bhel poori etc), roti/naan basket with assorted naans are awesome. Four of us including two kids went there last week, we ordered quite few items like couple of veg curries, 2 assorted naan baskets, dhahi poori etc, bill was 90+ SGD. You can get the same food within 50-60SGD in other restaurants around Syed Alwi Road but not the quality. Very conveniently located opposite Mustafa shopping Centre. Note: longer waiting time during weekends, not a place for south Indian food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",excellent food,40,2 August 2016,"there are 2 locations of this. One is opposite Mustafa which was excellent a few years ago and now is consistently dirty and I refuse to step foot inside. But if you want great food and are willing to trek it about 10 minutes down the next street, you will find the main location which is big bright airy and has the most delectable food. worth a stop on any trip."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat par excellence,50,1 August 2016,I had been here 2 years ago and loved it. The first place that came to mind during my business trip this year was this one. Their chaat it just fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some mind blowing chaat.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mumbai Street Food in Singapore,50,31 July 2016,Delicious food well known for their Chaats that are so tasty and come with so many different fillings. Highly recommended
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the Better Chaat Options ,40,26 July 2016,This is part of the famous Mumbai Restaurant chain and have two outlets in Singapore.We come here to eat Chola Bhatura and some chaat. The food is good and reasonably priced. Pani Puri and Pav Bhaji are the only let downs here. Be warned on weekends it is very difficult to get seating so go on weekdays. Kids love the place and we recommend this place. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Glorious vegetarian dininng,50,21 July 2016,"Visited Kailash Parbat for an early dinner on a weekday evening. Restaurant was fairly full although it was a weekday. Interior decoration is elegant and lighting was pleasant. We enjoyed the papri chaat and dahi puri for starters, which were really nice. Overall, we had nice dining experience"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A north indian food experience in Singapore,50,21 July 2016,"Another place to visit in SG is Kailash Parbat for authentic North Indian food experience. The chole bhatures, the palak paneer and the jal jheera are items one must taste here for sure. Ideally located in Little India, spacious and a good experience overall"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place!,40,17 July 2016,"We visited this place about 3-4 times during our 8 days in Singapore. It's a nice place for chaats. Liked their chola Bhatura too. Service was nice as well.
Visited in August 2013"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Great Food,except the chaat!",40,16 July 2016,The food was quite awesome ! Didn't expect it to be that good when entered . Do try veg manchurian and chole bature. Chaat was a kinda disaster though. But except that the food was excellent.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Kulfi,40,14 July 2016,Just dropped in for a quick kulfi after lunch and found it pricey (SGD 10 each) but very testy and well prepared. Service and ambience is good too.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian food !!,40,13 July 2016,"Its originally a chain from Mumbai. They have 2 restaurants in Singapore.
You will get all the authentic Punjabi food + chat items + Indian sweets."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good yummy food,30,7 July 2016,Great foodLots of options to choose. Hara bara kebab was very yummy. Naan and side dish gravies were very yummy and perfectly cooked. Pani puri was very hard. Dahi puri Dahi was veri veri frozen cold.Should less oil in the gravies. Naan and chapattis tasted great. Waitress was annoying .We ordered 7 chapathis and she kept on annoying are you going to eat all or any of your Friends coming or you going to pack food for home.Which was quiet irritating and no manners.They should better teach the waitress who takes order to stop asking nonsense to customers. There are people who eat lot and 7 chapathis are not too much for 2 people. Finally food was great and she was not harsh and other people were friendly and neat clean ambience. But her way of questioning was annoying and it's none of her business to question us on are we going to eat all or pack or ordering for friends.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic flavourful food for family!,40,4 July 2016,We had the balla papdi chaat which was excellent along with the chaat platter which was good. The naan is done nicely while the pashtoon dal makhni and diwani handi were excellent! I did not really like the hobo manchurian with gravy - in future I'll stick to the dry version. The mango lassi is lovely as was the sweet and salty lime juice! The masala chai was good and the desserts here are excellent! Nice place for a family visit. Price is around $20-30 a person.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Do not visit if you want to eat good Chaat and Pani Puri.,20,3 July 2016,"Went to the Belilios Road outlet(there's another one on syed alwi road) today for some Chaat, Paani Puri and Desserts. The puri for the paani puri tasted oily and stale and the same for chaat platter. Complained to the waiter about it but no one really cared. The desserts were good. The only highlight of the trip. The main course probably tastes better and is probably the reason for it's popularity but I'd give it a miss otherwise."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore,50,28 June 2016,"If you want to have a great taste of north Indian or south or west Indian, this is the right place to goVisited numerous times, and like the food always.This is pure vegetarian restaurant, so a plus for us. It's a bit pricey though, the quality compensate the price.A must visit for Indian food lovers.They hVe one more branch just opposite to gate no 2 of Mustafa near Anand bhawan. That place is smaller compared to this one. Ambience is quite nice."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",claustrophobic place,20,27 June 2016,"seats are clustered, heard a lot about the name but very upset with rundown service and bad quality of north indian food. Was half cooked"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian,40,19 June 2016,"A colleague introduced me to this restaurant and I try to visit whenever I am in Singapore. Some nights can be busy, but the wait is well worth it. The chaat and gulab jamun are as good as can be."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",LEAST CONCERNED ABOUT CUSTOMERS,10,19 June 2016,They believe in quantity and not quality. They have created a hype to overcharge customers. I recommend TRY OTHER PLACES. AVERAGE FOOD AND SERVICE QUALITY COMPARED TO PRICES
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",horrible service and food,10,18 June 2016,"no care for the customers , only interested in collecting money . went with friends and lot of hopes but really disappointed . my first and last visit there"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average place,30,18 June 2016,It is a decent chat corner but nothing great to rave about. The prices are on the higher side. The service was pretty laid back and had to wait for dishes once the order was placed. The servers do not wear gloves and Hygiene factor could be improved
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",As authentic as it gets @ SG,40,16 June 2016,"This restaurant offers North Indian fare and is one of the few places where I have gone more than a couple of times for its Chole-Bhature. Good service, cheap prices and good spread make it a bargain. If you are craving for north Indian food in SG then you can give this place shot."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Western setting for Indian cuisine,40,13 June 2016,"It would made life easier if they had English descriptions under their dishes' names. The mango lassi was delicous as it should be. If you are looking for a slightly decent place for a dinner, this would be it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food in SG,50,8 June 2016,"Go to place for north Indian food. Good place, friendly staff, tasty food. Usually crowded but definitely worth the wait."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",We had a hearty meal here!!,50,19 May 2016,Good Indian food was available here...though a bit costly but worth it..Good for Indians who want to have Indian meal while in Singapore..Jain food was not available..but the Amras puri during mango season was simply heavenly...

North and South Indian both food taste is awesome.. almost all variety of food.. staff is humble.. Best for Jain food.. I recomend this Restaurant
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome restaurant,50,13 May 2016,"Hey guys!If you are searching for a good North-Indian restaurant with the best chaats and Chole bhathures, this is the best place. I have been there multiple of times. The Pani puri there is heavenly. The restaurant has an amazing ambience and is clean. It is definitely expensive but the food is worth the money. I hope my review helps you guys!Bye! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Stale food and no feedback form.,20,7 May 2016,We ordered for pav bhaji and samosa. Both of them were stale... and smelling. While the restaurant manager took note.... There was no action nor ay kind of apology.... Surprisingly.... Kailash parbat does mot have a feedback form. So there kind of food quality and service matters are either very frequent to maintain track or just dont matter.Next time you visit just ask if they have freshly prepared anything and then order.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian Food,50,19 April 2016,"This is know as a good restaurant for Indian food lover. Ambience of the restaurant is good as a normal restaurant and staff is also nice with quick service. They have number of Indian food starting from starter to main course, chaat etc. I have tried there samosa chats and pannipuri both was good. There main course is also good and feel you like you are sitting in a places with in India. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Famous Maybe Standards of Service and Chaat wose than a Dhaba,30,18 April 2016,"Our second time, in as many years. Didn't feel welcome at all as we walked in. Tired, insipid and uninterested staff. This ws at 3:00 pm when it wasn't busy.Bhel puri LOUSY! Dahi puri OK; Salted Lassi a thick slurry. Left half and it took as long to get the bill as the man who oversees chaat preparation also closes the bill!! One man dhaba moe efficient."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disappointing Chaat!!,10,14 April 2016,"I went to Kailash Parbat to celebrate my birthday yesterday with some chaat (as I love paani puri a lot). I ordered for one plate paani puri and one plate dahi puri. I was so disappointed with both these dishes. The pooris used were very hard and oily. It actually bruised my mouth. The sweet and spicy water of pani puri were nice. The dahi puri was horrible. The puri was again oily and hard, the sev used as topping was stale and smelly. The tea they served was cold. The ambiance was nice though but the chaat was a complete NO! NO!We went there with high expectations and were left disappointed."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious,50,8 April 2016,I had visited this restaurant based on internet reviews. My experience was awesome. We were fedup with typical punjabi food and visited this place for a change. The fulka roti and aloo matar was awesome. Do try khichdi which is also delicious. The food was a bit costlier but tastes awesome and hence is recommended. It is located in little india area as is good for indian vegetarian visitors.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Food,50,4 April 2016,Kailash Parbat is part of the Indian restaurant chain from Mumbai. The restaurant offers some of the best Indian street side food in addition to some of the best North and South Indian dishes. Located in the heart of Little India it is one the favorite for all tourists visiting Singapore and looking for Indian food. This is a must visit place for all food lovers.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Quality Food ! value for money,50,4 April 2016,"We have visited Kailash Parbat with family numerous times - both little India and Syed Alvi Road. Excellent Place, the quality of food is very good and everytime - no exception. The Panner dishes and the Jaipur Biryani is excellent. You do not feel bloated after the food though the food is made in Ghee and rich in calories. Excellent service and good staff. Excellent chat items. Must visit."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Indian Food away from India,50,3 April 2016,"KP ws our favourite place while we were on a holiday 2 singapore. The food is just amazing and the service is very fast. Tried pav bhaji,chole bathura,lassi and even north indian dishes but didnt felt that we are eating at a restaurant outside india. We felt as if we are eating at a indian restaurant in india."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best north indian food in Singapore,50,26 March 2016,"I have been to Kailash Parbat on multiple occasions, and its quality has always been consistently good. The place is a hit among the indian community and I have hardly seen any empty seats.The menu has lots of options. They have indian chaat, panipuri and chhole bhature all quite good, and which you wont find in many places. The yellow and black daals served here are extremely good! Paneer dishes are excellent as well.The service is efficient and the seating arrangement has space for both small or big groups. Prices are mid-range and put to shame any indian eatery outside Little India. This is one of the best 'bang for the buck' indian restaurants in Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent IndianFood,40,21 March 2016,"Our menu:
- koki - sindhi roti
- daal makhni
- paneer in cashew gravy
- papad
- roti of course
koki was at its best.. must say good for sindi food.. its best you can find in SG.. indian food of course is good..."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian street food!,50,20 March 2016,"Kailash parbat is a regular for us (we are Indians) and a place where we take family visiting from home too - they never get disappointed by the authentic taste.The chaats and street corner food are the best. It being a Sindhi restaurant, would highly recommend trying Koki there (a type of bread which has spices and is fried). Bhatura and Pav Bhaji are excellent too.. With such good street food, I have tried eating the main course meals only once and decided to stick with the street food.For people with a sweet tooth, try the Jamun-e-Jannat (Hot gulab jamuns in cold rabri)We are regulars here and will keep on visiting. Prefer the Belilios Lane outlet to the one at Syed Alwi road"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian food! ,40,17 March 2016,"Had been to this place during our Singapore visit of 2 days. We had dinner here both days. This is a chain of restaurant across india and the quality and standards are maintained here as well. The food is very tasty and authentic indian food is available. For those who feel homesick this is the best option. Located in little India locality, truely feels like home. The prices are a bit high but its worth it"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place for North Indian Vegetarian Food !,50,16 March 2016,"This review is based on our second visit to this lovely restaurant. Last time we had Dahi Bhalla Chaat and Chole Bhature, which were EXCELLENT ! This time, we had Corn Malai Seekh Kabaabs, and Kayberi Kadjai Paneer with a Bread Basket. All the items were superb and mouth-watering, and we had a hearty meal. Another nice thing about them is their location, it is bang opposite Mustafa Center, so its very convenient before a round of grocery shopping to have a heart meal ! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the best vegetarian Indian food restaurant in the city,50,13 March 2016,"If you haven't tried KP, you are missing an important Indian joint. I have visited this multiple times and have tried a number of food varieties. Some one of the recommended ones are Bhindi masala, Palak paneer, garlic naan (highly recommended), pav bhaji, manchow soup, fried rice, gobi manchurian and finally masala chaas."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fabulous Food,50,5 March 2016,Highly recommend we didn't know what to order but the lovely waiter made suggestions which we were happy to go along with. Amazing !! Don't bother to have wine or beer. It's warm and overpriced Food excellent tho !
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place to have North Indian Chat,40,2 March 2016,"Nice ambience and quality of food is good. You should try Ajwaini panner tikka my all time favourite. Eventhough, their service is not up to the mark and little bit expensive but you will not disappointed with the quality of the food. They serve Indo Chinese food (for example manchurian)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian snack food,30,29 February 2016,"Kailash Parbat offers a good variety of authentic and tasty Indian snack food. However, I think that they are overpriced."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best indian restaurant,50,25 February 2016,The best place to have Indian food when you are in Singapore. The food here is lip-smacking and also with the budget.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",What's the fuss about !!!!,20,21 February 2016,Average food and pathetic service sums up this place aptly !! I am not sure why it's regarded as one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore - most dishes taste stale!! Freshness is something that is not offered on their menu and so is the service. Servers seem to have been forced to work.Give this place a miss and try out loads of better ones during your next visit to Singapore. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good ,40,19 February 2016,Very good food. Very friendly staff. Worth visiting if you are a vegetarian. Located near Mustafa and easily approachable.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Paradise for vegetarians!,50,19 February 2016,"Its a paradise for vegetarians! Truly! The food is amazing! Ambiance & staff add up to the goodness.They serve mainly north-India food. However, their starts are the highlight. Chaat, pani-poori can be eaten anytime. The price range is mid-high. but totally worth it!You will usually find queue on weekends so prefer making reservation."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best Indian restaurant in Singapore,50,16 February 2016,"Kailash Parbat is one of best Indian restaurant in Singapore.In little India area there are two branches of the same. We goes to the bigger one. It's ambiance is good and staff is very good. You can find all types of Indian vegetarian food including chaat, snacks, South Indian, North Indian and many varieties. One can fully satisfy after eating here. Rates are high but taste of food is awesome."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but pricey...,40,15 February 2016,"Restaurants galore at Syed Alwi Road but this is a stand out vegetarian option in the crowd. Went there one evening around 5pm, hoping to get some chaat and we got exactly what we wanted. Their samosa chaat and bhel puri were excellent. My wife wanted a chola bhatura and that tasted great too! I was disappointed that basundhi was not available, but got rasamalai instead. It was a bit of a let down as it wasn't sweet enough to me. This is a good vegetarian option for those who want to taste north indian and chaat, but the prices are a bit on the higher side."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good Food,40,13 February 2016,"We had been here a few times. The good is definitely above average, the service is excellent but I believe due to the Brand name ""Kailash Parbat"", the place is overly hyped.. Recommended to try though. Huzayf"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Food heaven!!,40,13 February 2016,"Kailash Parbat is an excellent choice for Indian veggie food seekers in Singapore. There are 2 locations - one on Serangoon Road and one located opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road.They boast a large menu with a lot of food items raging from chat items like sev puri/pani puri to panner curries, nan/roti/kuclha, biriyani etc.Overall an excellent choice!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good Dinner!,40,12 February 2016,"Visited this restaurant with a great expectation.
Ordered starters than main course.
Everything was good and service was great.
Little pricy but ok to pay since the taste was good.
Happy and satisfied customer!
Thanks.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent Food,30,7 February 2016,"Visited this place only once, the food was decent, the sitting is ok. Their outlet at bellilos road is better"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Food,50,7 February 2016,"This is a must visit place for Indian vegetarian food lovers, there are plenty of options ranging from Chats, Snacks and main course food. Don't forget to have the masala chai here and of course don't leave without satisfying your sweet tooth :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome chaat,40,4 February 2016,"Whenever i feel home sick, i go to this place for good chaat ..
Especially
Pani puri
College grill sandwich
Food is really good.. All the products are very well served and has good quality.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Decent food, good service",40,29 January 2016,"If you wish to have decent North Indian vegetarian food near Mustafa then I will surely recommend this one. Evenings are crowded and the staff are usually quite tensed in managing the crowd. Quite often you see even the chefs struggling and the food takes time to be served. But once you get it, it's good!They used to have Arbi tuk, which was heavenly. They seem to have taken it out of the menu and sometimes reluctantly give you it's half Cousin, aloo tuk. The chaat items are extremely good and the Chef at the chaat counter is extremely kind to make them the way you want.Chole Bhatura is quite oily but who cares - it's consistently good. Bhatura and Parata platters which have three or four different types of them are quite filling for two and are highly recommended. Hyderabadi biryani and the Awadhi biryani are also quite good.Chaaz is always too salty but lassis are good. Desserts are just okay.It's a bit pricey but would certainly recommend as it serves one of the best North Indian dishes in this area. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good chaat,50,24 January 2016,We r surprise to see lots of variety of chaats in singapore .we take dinner in this restaurant. taste was too good ambience is OK.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food bit costly,30,18 January 2016,"Good authentic food. Indian taste. Slightly overpriced specially Tandoori Roti. Ambience is good. Staff is South Indian so difficult to communicate in hindi.
Chana bhatura is good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, awful service",30,15 January 2016,"The chaats are delicious - the three of us had three chaats which was one too many but the waiter was totally unhelpful with advice on the right quantities for three people. The Hyderabad biryani and curd rice were very good too, as was the dhal and bendi. But why did we feel so rushed? They kept coming to clear the dishes, kept asking if we were done and then brought the bill before we had even asked for it! Noisy. Stressful. Not returning anytime soon, but they probably won't notice. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Tea time with poor service ,20,14 January 2016,"I visited this restaurant on my way to the major department store across of it as I was craving some Masala tea. I like the Masala tea freshly made and with no sugar. I know this place makes it with both requirements. While the tea itself was what I expected, the service have much to improve. I asked for the tea from an attendant upon entering. She was counting coins and even though seemed she took the order, I wasn't sure as there was no welcoming response, and just kept counting coins. I sat down hoping an attendant would approach, but to no avail. I stood up to get the menu myself as I considered also having some snacks. Was about to walk out since no one approached and was unsure the tea order was made, but just then the tea arrived(on a cup poorly served and stained from serving the tea itself). Just decided to have the tea but no snacks. The snack options on the menu are not as varied either. During my entire stay, no one approached. The tea is good but the service has much to improve. Likely will not return either. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",VERY OIL FOOD,20,12 January 2016,"had the chhole bhature here after hearing really good reviews.
But after the meal i felt like i drank a pint of refined oil"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat In Kailash Parbat,40,8 January 2016,"A restaurant with history- specially for chaat , chole bature and authentic sindhi food. The gol-gappe/panipuri was very good, better than in India and so was papri,ragda-patis.Also enjoyed four types of chole bature but the paneer bature was the best. The Indian curry was average but the lachha paratha was good. The cleanliness and ambiance was very good. Convenient being next to Mustafa Indian Departmental Store.Indian sweets are really very good.The price band for food items is reasonable."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lives upto the exprectations always!,40,2 January 2016,"We have celebrated many occasions - my birthday, our anniversary, took mom-dad and casual Friday lunch with office mates. And we celebrated New Year 2016 dinner here too.The place always lives upto the expectations. Amazing Chaat items - Sev Puri Chaat, Veg starters - Paneer Plack pepper. I simply love the daal makhni here. Diwani Handi was also good.Enjoyed Rabdi to the core in the deserts. It is a proper dine-in restaurant with pleasing ambiance. May appear expensive to some but it is the price for food and place.The only advice I would like to make to the management is, they need to improve the service level consistently. Train employees how to deal with situations and improve the level of attentiveness towards customers, kind advice since we are regular visitors. Hire part timers for weekends and special occasions if that helps!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good chaat papdi and choley bhature,50,30 December 2015,"Visited recently

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bit expensive for Average food,30,29 December 2015,We ordered food at our Hotel.The food was average but a bit expensive .They dont provide onions with the food which was a minus
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Reasonable Chaat Place in Singapore,40,25 December 2015,Go to Kailash Parbat with family to try different varieties of ChaatThe Bhatura platter is a must-try with different varieties like the methi and masala variants. Easily the best dish in this place.Pani puri and the ragda pattice was reasonable. Was disappointed with the Kulfi dessert as it was not upto the mark
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Enjoyable meal,40,23 December 2015,"Went to Kailas Parbat as we longed for home food, was not disappointed. Was really satisfying to eat here after shopping at Mustafa Centre. Avoid going there on Public holidays as its too crowded. try going in the afternoon when its not crowded. Tasty food, good service with a smile.Was served well."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food ,40,15 December 2015,"Our preferred Vegetarian only North Indian restaurant in Little India area. Our regular picks are Paneer Tikka, Pani Puri, Dahi papdi chat. Tasty vegetarian dishes for main course and finishing touch with Jamuni Jannat, rasa malai :) Recommend for lunch / dinner with family & friends . "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Veg Restaurant,30,14 December 2015,"Veg Restaurant similar to one's in Mumbai
Chole bhatura was tasty
It is located close to Mustafa centre."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent,50,8 December 2015,Have been to Kailash Parbat in India many time and found the one in Little India to be as good as the one in India. Good options for vegetarians. When placing the order remember that the quantity is good (much more than in most places) so place an order accordingly. Food was good and so was the service. Good atmosphere. If in Little India opt for Kailash parbat much better than all the restaurants opposite Mustafa market. As they are opposite Mustafa normally one goes but Kailash Parbat is also hardly 3 to 5 minutes walk from mustafa
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Yummy Food,50,3 December 2015,"Good service, cooperative employees and beautiful ambience. I want to go again and I will recommend to others also."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible!,10,30 November 2015,"This was seriously the worst food I have ever had in my life after paying so much! The samosa was nothing to talk about, bathing in oil for I don't know how many hours, I cannot even be sure if it was made the same day! N the paratha was even worse, fully uncooked from the inside.. Forget about cleanliness if u have to visit this place.. I was so damned disappointed.. N its all so expensive, so u obviously expect good quality but that does not seem to be the case! Anyway I would never ever go back to eat here.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious Indian Vegetarian Spread,40,29 November 2015,"Have visited many times and tried a variety of dishes. Some of my all times favourites here are Do Rukha Kumbh - stuffed grilled mushrooms, papdi chat and kulfi falooda. All chat items and curries are good; but rice items are a bit disappointing. Desserts are rich and delicious."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Vegetarian Food....and air conditioning.,30,27 November 2015,"We chose this place as it looked like they would have air-conditioning and offer some respite form the Singapore heat-and it did.We arrived late lunch and despite the sparse crowd, the wait staff were in no hurry to serve. The food however was delicious and well worth it. Pricier than the surrounding restaurants in Little India but worth it for the quality of food and the air-conditioning"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chole Bhatura is indeed their best item,40,13 November 2015,Went for a repeat visit at this place last week and was pleased to note that their chole bhatura is really good! we did try pani puri and that was not good at all. Tried another interesting dish-ragda pattice sandwich! not bad. But stick to CB and you will never be disappointed
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Veg (Jain) Option opposite Mustafa, Little India",30,12 November 2015,"This is a typical restaurant like we have back home (Mumbai, India). I have been there couple of times just for the craving of chaats and this is one of the few Jain food options in Singapore. Except for the taste of Indian food (almost all items) and the sweets, I did not find anything great about this place. Place looks to little cramped, and it turns out to be too noisy when full. We (6 of us) were given a table which was joint with another table for capacity of 4, so it felt like we were together and sharing meals :). Service is worse, they cannot manage when the crowd is full and the frustration will come out on one of us if we are unlucky when we ask them for an additional service like providing glasses to drink water. I believe it was a bad day for us. They messed with orders; getting some other item instead of what was ordered. And yes, cost is little on the higher side compared to other restaurants.PS: This review is for the branch they have opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road. I am not sure if Kailash Parbat has any other branch in Singapore. I have seen there are reviews for Serangoon Road Branch as well, so they might have other branch there."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Vegetarian Delight,50,29 October 2015,"Nice restaurant for vegetarian food in Little India. Courteous and prompt service, not very expensive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fine dining in Little India,50,28 October 2015,"Authentic Indian food is the highlight of the place. Though it is a bit pricey, but the taste justifies the price. Chaats are yummy."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fine Dining in Little India,30,27 October 2015,The place is slightly like a Fine dining restaurant in Little India. Hence it is pretty expensive compared to the other restaurants in Little India. The food is decent.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Amust go for Chats,40,27 October 2015,this is the place for Chats and other north Indian delicacies. we had visited the place multiple times and the experience is good. its towards the expensive side.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pretty decent,40,26 October 2015,"We absolutely loved whatever we ordered here. We ordered a Sev Puri, a Kofta and Cheese Naan and everything was pretty tasty and served promptly. The place was bustling with people and so a tad noisy but food was quite alright. The chef was also careful enough when we ordered Chhole Bhatture, he came in and said, sorry but the Chhole haven't turned out good tonight so its better we order something else. I appreciate that humane honesty a lot. For Indians seeking veg food or chaat in Singapore, this is the place to go! :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Go there for chaats!,40,22 October 2015,"I think their food is good but their specialty to me chaats, oh the chola bhatura platter with paneer bhaturas are not to miss."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but inconsistent!!!,30,18 October 2015,"We visit this place quite frequently as part of the Little India grocery trip. I find the food to be good -- my usuals are Chana Bhatore, Dahi Puri & Lassi. Generally good -- however, I find the food quality and taste to be highly inconsistent, especially Bhatore can be oily at times. The service too is nothing to call out.Its also a bit of a struggle to manage baby chairs."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good For Vegitarian Food.,40,14 October 2015,Nice Taste... As its international Brand.. Little Bit Costly.. But good in Taste. Taste chole bhature for special taste.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Food But Awful Service,30,14 October 2015,"Food Quality Was Okay not Awesome. The Price paid for the food was RIDICULOUSLY HIGHThe Service was a Nightmare, especially the way they bring food onto the table. When you go to a normal restaurant you will notice butlers / waiters bringing in food in a nice and clean tray, however in this restaurant you will notice a bunch of waiters / waitresses coming with a freaking attitude holding plates and bowls in dirty hands so here comes a question of hygiene. Not sure how other reviewers did not notice this. The lady who looked like an owner to me was polite enough to come and ask whether we received our food on time etc. but the overall experience at this restaurant was Awful. In addition to this, the area this restaurant is in, is the most horrible place.Will never every return here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Mixed opinion, one dish good and other dish is bad",30,14 October 2015,"First time went and had Jaipur Biryani. It was good. Second time went to other restaurant near Mustafa. Taste sucks. Tried chat platter. It was not very good. Heard great reviews and recommendations. However recently had food in a friends place catered Kailash parbat, it was great. Very inconsistent."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food in Singapore!,50,10 October 2015,I've eaten at many Indian restaurants and this is by far the best for North Indian food. Have eaten there twice and excellent food both times. Their chaat especially stands out!

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place for pure vegetarian Indian cuisine,40,5 October 2015,"It's a nice and cosy place for Indian vegetarian cuisine in Singapore. They have two outlets and both of them are in the city area. There is one outlet which is opposite the Mustafa Center Gate-2.Along side the signature Indian dishes, one can also look forward for sweets, chats (pani-puri, delhi chaat, samaosa, etc) which is usually fresh and delicious.The service is professional. The place however may seem to be little pricey. A sumptuous meal for 2 people can be around S$ 40-45."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian food in Serangoon!,40,5 October 2015,"The food was great, ranging from the chola bhatura to the basic naan sabzi. Lot of local Indians seem to eat at the place... It was a great meal in totality!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome food and great hospitality,50,15 September 2015,The food here is awesome. Heaven for Indians in Singapore. The place is quite clean and staff is courteous. Portions servings are enough for two. Little on the expensive side but we didnt mind it as everything compensated the high prices. The place is conveniently located on main road and is accessible easily through MRT (local singapore transport). Thumbs-up!

Schezwan noodles, Dal makhni and rice.All food were fresh, good portion size and tasty.For desert, we had Malai rabri and it was authentic.Cant fault either service or food. By the way, we ordered home delivery also that night and another good experience."

Great place to have a meal with family and friends."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",NORTH INDIAN CUISINE,30,24 July 2015,Kailash Parbat speciality is Main North Indian as well as snack dishes .It is generally well cooked & presented prompmptly .Indian Sweets are also available in the Restauarant.Restauarant Ambience & seating is well done . Size of portions in various dishes is rather meagre & just enough for two people which makes it a little costly. Also one has to carefully place order & recheck as there ia a chance of mixing orders .
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",It is the best,40,22 July 2015,This restaurant is right next to ferrer park mrt . . .The food that you find here can be compared to authentic indian food that you can find in india in top quality restaurants no matter which city you live in . . . the dal makhani is simply yum . . plz try it and you would want to go over and over again . . its a bit pricey though

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Taste!!!,50,10 July 2015,"We head to this place in Little India (Singapore) after reading good reviews about this restaurant at various sites and i must say that ""Kailash Parbat"" didn't disappoint us at all. They serve good quality food with awesome taste which i can call very authentic as well and at quite reasonable price. They have a very nice ambience although and serve almost everything you desire for from an Indian vegetarian restaurant right from chaats to main course dishes with delectable breads (almost all varieties except missi roti which is my husband's favourite) to desserts . Their quantity is good too.We tried their kadhai paneer with tandoori roti there and it was delicious. Later we also had their ras malai which was good too. Next day we tried their gol gappas and dahi bhalla chaat which was delicious as well. Their staff is nice and converse in Hindi & English both which makes you feel that you are sitting in a restaurant in India :). They have two branches in Little India and both of them are very well connected to MRT .We would highly recommend this place as a must visit for anyone craving for delicious and hygienic Indian Vegetarian Food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,50,9 July 2015,This is a small restaurant of the famous Kailash Parbat chain located in Little India. Staff is very courteous and polite. Most of them are Indian and speak Hindi. Food is great and for a moment you feel as if you are eating in India only. Must visit if you want good indian food. They also serve Jain Food.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disaster,20,8 July 2015,We had a visitor from Europe and my cousin suggested we take him to this place. It was nothing to shout about. Went back again to their other branch with my spouse. The visit just reconfirmed first impression. There is nothing special. It is good for people who want vegetarian food for nostalgic reasons. I would definitely give it a miss. Staff very helpful and friendly.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",BEST Service and Excellent Taste ,50,7 July 2015,Cannot complaint about this restaurant at all. Taste of all the dishes are excellent and Service was good as well. Best Choice for Vegetarian.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Gol Gappe,40,6 July 2015,Kailsah parbat is one safe place to fall back to when you want excellent spicy traditional north indian food. We have been there couple of times to have food and sometimes just to satisfy the craving for gol gappe. The starters as well as chat is very yum. No wonder the place is always crowded.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good veg restaurant ,30,6 July 2015,Its a good veg restaurant. Been there many times. Their sweets are must to have. I always go there during ganesh puja time. As they make the mawa sweets. Tasty. Service is good but sometime it gets very crowded and need to wait for very long. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent food,50,3 July 2015,"I have visited this place many time. Very good in terms of variety, quality and consistency.
Staff is friendly and food is not very expensive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Charges for onions seperatly. Avg exprnce. ,20,2 July 2015,A very average experience. They serve good quality food with a very low quality of service. The food is a bit over priced and they even charge for onion seperatly. The waiters are not warm and welcoming during the serve. Whereas the other indian restrnts in the neigbhrhood are much better. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Comfortable restaurant with OK food.,40,30 June 2015,"Just opposite to Grand Imperial hotel, nice, cozy with very good seating arrangement, serving Indian food. They serve in good quantity. Quality is also superb.. Taste is OK."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,40,29 June 2015,"Good :
We ordered Indian/Chinese here and all the items very good. All staff is Indian and served us in very professional manner
Bad:
Very expensive"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",PATHETIC SERVICE !!!!,30,27 June 2015,"i visited this restaurant after going through reviews on trip advisor but hugely disappointed by there service. It took more than 20 minutes to get the order. Even a small request of providing plastic plate for my kid took them 15 minutes.the place is clean and can cater upto 40 to 50 guests at one go, but they have only ONE CHEF (as told by there staff to me) so if you are a a big family avoid this place because your order will take lot of time.The food was better than average, nothing I can complaint about the quality of food. but the service is awful I suggest the owner/manager of the kailash part to look into there service part as tasty food alone cannot help you build a reputation."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",yummy,50,24 June 2015,all chats and north indian food is available at kailsh parbat..we cant miss Indian food in singapore...nice restaurent
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,30,17 June 2015,"This joint is located in busy area of Little India. It is famous for Indian fast food & sweets. Only veg items are available. It is expensive with regard to the food quality, service & ambience."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Top choice for Indian veg foods,50,13 June 2015,"On my 4th visit I finally decide to write this review. I'm a non veg eater but this venue really impresses me and also my friends. Food: Every option is perfectly made. Such large variety to choose from. I've never eaten anything I didn't enjoy so I know the other 80% of menu will be tasty. Service: This has been acceptable. They try to come across and upmarket service but it gets so busy and staff just do a simple job. They have these iPad minis to take our orders down. So the owner is moving forward. There was even this nice aunty clearing tables often. Nice. Atmosphere: it's not fine dining. Not definitely not casual. It's perfectly in between. Nice chairs and tables. Clever paper place mats. Deseert sweets on display as you enter. Pleasant water features. Round tables. Can cater for large groups. Next door us events room. Huge kids party was taking place. Mostly busy so makes one feel the place is well liked and not just a tourist spot like some racecourse road venues. Cleanliness: the restuarant was clean. But bathroom area next door needed more attention. As said. Just busy place. Still easy to wash hands before and after dinner. I recommend to enjoy the food with your clean hands. Overall: I will always come here for my veg foods knowing it's reliable. My vegetarian guests were impressed with the food, venue and pricing was reasonable. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Like Eating in India,50,13 June 2015,"We ate dinner 3 to 4 times here. It was always quite crowded. The service is slow. However, the food was great. The Sindhi chappati were soft . They helped us by making the lasunibdaal less spicy .the choke bhatura was a delight. The pani puris are expensive but yummy. The mhich Di was uninspired and mehakta basmati rice was a bit oily. Gulabjamuns were spot on Dinner is after 7 only. Overall like eating back home in Mumbai and a definite must for the Vegetarian Indian traveller. The restaurant was right behind the Park Royal hotel at Farrer park where we were staying and definitely a great place to eat. it is expensive but less than a five star hotel and with more variety."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Food! Quite High End,50,1 June 2015,"Food:
Great curries. Very North Indian focused but lots of Chaat on the menu too. The curries are deep and flavourful. Quite rich but very tasty.
Service:
Reasonable but not amazing.
Value:
It's slightly pricey but it's worth the money..."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good Chats, but on the expensive side",40,30 May 2015,"For a gujarati vegetarian in Singapore this place is like heaven. Variety of food options and some pretty good chats.If you like cholle bhature, you should try the different variety of bhaturas served here. You would not find it at many places even in India.The staff is usually slow specially during the rush hours, so have some time on your hand when you visit the place.Overall food is good, but expensive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian food,50,20 May 2015,"Visited this restaurant 2-3 times during my two month long visit to Singapore. It is a fantastic place for enjoying Indian food. Variety of vegetarian food is available i.e. North Indian, Gujarati, Jain food. Ambiance is very good. Once should not miss a visit to this place when in Singapore. Service is prompt. Tourists are welcomed with a smile by the staff."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic Place,50,19 May 2015,We enjoyed some real Gujju novelties at this place. Not a place if you are on a tight budget. 2 people bills will easily touch SGD50. Though taste and hygiene is of top quality.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great North Indian food,40,18 May 2015,"I was impressed that they had a separate menu for Jain Food to suit my requirements. Very tasty North Indian food, and decent service, though occasionally lackadaisical. Yet, went there quite a few times during my 5 month stay and was not too disappointed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",True Indian Food,50,18 May 2015,This place will not let you miss your Indian Food. You will get the best quality indian food here. This restaurant is in the market area. a bit costly worth the money. Must try!!!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good Indian snacks joint, situated opposite Grand Imperial hotel and you can try Paubhaji and Masala chai. Nice ambience",30,18 May 2015,Nice Ambience and nearby hotels. Some dishes are good but some are recooked. I had bad experience of Samosa. Dripping in oil. Avoid it.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Veg Food and Good Ambience,50,10 May 2015,"The Ambiance was good , with lots of space and light . The tables were placed with good distance between them and comfortable . We started with the chats which was really awesome and one of the best chats I have tasted. The main course was great as well . "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Veg Food ,40,2 May 2015,"This is simply the best Indian vegetarian restaurant that you'll find in Singapore. Cost wise, it's $50-60 for 2 people on an average. The Dal Makhani is the best here. So is Aloo Tuk/ Arbi Tuk. Been here at least 20 times. Be assured of good food. The one opposite Mustafa is usually crowded on weekend evenings."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good Munchow soup,50,2 May 2015,"We were a group of 6 people visiting Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa center. This was my First visit to this outlet. I have visited the other one near to temple on many occasions. We tried mix of Indian & chinese dishes. The munchow soup was really very very tasty. It had the right mix of hot & sour taste. After long time i had such a good soup in Singapore. In the main course we ordered paneer gravy, hyderabadi biryani and mix of roti & naan. They were all cooked very nicely. He staff was very helpful. One of us even got their mobile phone charged while we were having the meal. Our requests for hot water, pickle etc were well looked after. I also found the staff interacting with some customers who seemed to be regular on the table next to us in a very friendly manner. All my visits to Kailash Parbat have been very satisfying. I am sure to visit this place again. The munchow soup is highly recommended. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place for Indian Food.....!!!!,40,29 April 2015,"food quality was finger licking, one can get the variety of indian food as available in india....... but little overpriced."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent palce for family lunch/dinner,40,17 April 2015,"They have turned down the heat of Indian Cuisine to serve the locals. Should improve their quality of Indian tandoors that they serve. Gravies are good, salads are awesome and the best is mango lassi."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","One of the best vegetarian food in SG - Indian, IndoChinese, IndoThai",40,13 April 2015,"One of the best vegetarian food in SG with great taste. My family often visit branch in front of Mustafa, Little India.Staff is friendly and remember us. Service is also good. Customization in food possible on request.Chaat and Chole Bhature are very famous. But nowadays Bhature's are very oily.We generally order Three Pepper Paneer, Chaat Platter, Indo-Chinese dishes, Thai Green Curry and Mango LassiLittle overpriced, but ""okay"" because of fine taste.Highly recommended for vegetarians specially branch near Mustafa."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Had India vegetarian food,30,3 April 2015,Spent around 2 hours... the food was well cooked and tasty. The ambiance was good and it was not expensive. Had the feeling of India...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Homely (Indian) food at SG,40,3 April 2015,"I loved the food options - and with my love for Indian food this was a great place for the lunch choice.
You might have a wait for a while in the rush hours. However, its worth the wait."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",home away from home,30,30 March 2015,The place serves authentic Indian chaat. The taste was just like what you are served in India. So if you happen to visit Mustafa Shopping centre and want to splurge on Indian food the Kailash Parbat is a good option. The Cholley Bhatura are authentic so is the Chaat.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is good,40,28 March 2015,"For a long time me & my family wanted to have chaat from Kailash Parbat. We tried paani puri & Kailash Parbat chaat platter. The platter had 4 different chaats. The quantity was good enough for 2 people to share. Infact 2 of us & our 6 years daughter could not finish all the chats along with paani puri. If I remember the 4 chaats in the platter they were bhel puri, paapdi chaat, Dahi bhalla and shev puri. The taste was good. The combination of spices, puris and tomatoes & carrots was well balanced. I remember trying one of the chaat at nearby shop named Bikanerwala. It was not at all up to the expectation. Coming back to chaat from Kailash Parbat, paani puri was a bit of letdown for us. They server puri stuffed with potatoes and the water separately. We had to mix it before eating. In my opinion the paani is the heart & soul of paani puri which adds the tangy, sweet & spicy flavor to it. It was missing. Next time for sure I will give a miss to paani puri. Definitely the chaats which I have tied previously & the platter on this occasion are much better. If you are coming to expect the same taste as the chaats that you get in Mumbai or Goa where I come from, you might be little disappointed. We are used to a bit more tangy & spicy chaats. But other places where I have tried chaats they are similar to the ones available in Singapore in terms of taste & ingredients. If you are a chaat lover give a try for different chaats available in Kailash Parbat. I am sure i will visit this place again for chaats in future. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Impressive restaurant,50,20 March 2015,"This Indian restaurant serves very good and authentic Indian food. The quality of the food is very good and the taste is amazing.
The ambiance of the restaurant is also very good and is located well within the city."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good ambience and tasty chat,40,19 March 2015,"We visited few times Belilios lane one. Few days back my friend came from Japan it happened to visit infront of Mustafa one. We like the Ragada Sev Puri its very tasty. The Chaas was very good. The Hyderabadi Biryani loved it.The over all, the place is good for chaat and vegetarian food. The price wise its above average compare to other restuarants in that area."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Posh Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,30,19 March 2015,"I have always heard great reviews from people about the restaurant. But when I went there, I was not very impressed. The food was fine though I would say nothing special. On the other hand, the ambience of the restaurant was very nice. I felt that the prices of the food there were exorbitant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good place to eat chats and North indian food,50,15 March 2015,"This is a vegetarian restaurant, and this is a very good place if you want to have a taste of chats and north Indian food. Whenever I visit Singapore, I always visit this place."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Ambience and Good place,40,11 March 2015,"This restaurant is an upmarket vegetarian restaurant famous for its chaats with good service.Popular place,so seating might be an issue on crowded days."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place to have Indian food,40,1 March 2015,"Kailash Parbat is right on the junction of Syed Alwi Road in Little India. Its the best place around for North Indian food. Do try Chole Bhature if you are there. The menu is good with a decent spread across Indian Snacks and Main Course. A pure veg restaurant, decently priced and good seating space. Masala tea is rocking :). During our 5 nights stay in Parkroyal on Kitchener road, this was our first go-to place for Dinner."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Must visit....excellent food !! Excellent service !!! Good staff,50,17 February 2015,Best hotel !!excellent food....u will feel u r eating in india......!!! Must visit good service good food.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect choice for vegeterians,40,17 February 2015,"If you are a pure vegetarian or looking for authentic north Indian vegetarian food during your trip to Singapore your search ends here. Service is quick, food is delicious and staff doesn't resort to rules to say 'no' as is pretty evident elsewhere in the city. Restaurant is air-conditioned and ambiance is just fine. For a sumptuous north Indian we paid around 90-100 SD for 5 adults so quite a value for money."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bel poori & pani poori!,50,16 February 2015,"My favorite Indian restaurant! We usually will order bel poori and pani poori! Good food and very affordable!
Located near Mustafa Shopping Centre."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian Food,30,14 February 2015,"Good North Indian Joint in Singapore

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best restaurant!!!,50,9 February 2015,This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore... v always celebrate our birthdays n anniversary here... from chats to main course to their kulfi.. everythin is amazing!!! Highly recommended !!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Kailash Parbat,40,3 February 2015,"On a recent trip to singapore i discovered KP as i call it and had to visit and check out the Chaats.We went to the one opposite Mustafa store as it was easy to park in Mustafa. We got a table straight away. We ordered starters of Dahi Batata Puri, Ragda patties and Hara Bhara Kabab.All of the them were well made. The patties was very big.Followed by North Indian main meal which was Chole bhatura, navratan karma and some paneer sabzi. Nice food. Worth a visit if you are in the mood for Chaat."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian Food.,40,1 February 2015,"A really good place to have North Indian Food in Little India, Singapore. Went their once and then started ordering for home delivery for lunch at my clients place at orchard road."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic veg north Indian food and great service,50,31 January 2015,With my family here. Service available even at 11 pm Saturday night and the place is full house and more are waiting. Great food and equally good service. Prices are at par with similar Indian restaurants in the area. Will be back.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",it's opp Mustafa-not Pulau Bin,30,27 January 2015,"The address given on tripadvisor is wrong. As far as the Restaurent is concerned it's pure veg and the food is not bad, but it's other branch (10 mins walk from this branch) is much better.If you decide to eat here, try Chholw Bhature, Pani Puri, Samosa Chaat, Dahi Bhalla, Sev Puri and Bhel puri in that order of preference. Apple mint and lassi are good as drinks. Desserts are not great."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Chhole Bhature,40,27 January 2015,"We often visit KP at Serangoon road (next to the indian temple between little India and farrer park MRT). This outlet is better than the one opposite mustafa in terms of ambience, quality, taste and quantity served.They serve great chat items (although only half as good as in India, but best in Singapore). Start with Pani Puri. You will love Samosa Chat. Get Apple mint juice. The best on the menu is Chhole Bhature... Different varieties of it... All are good. Tastes great with chilly and onion. After this you can try Sev Puri, Dahi Bhalla and Bhel Puri in that order. Lassi isNot bad too.Sweets / Desserts are not so great. They are not bad, but you can find better other places in SingaporeDon't miss the (free) mukhvaas/ mouth freshener upon exit."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent ,40,25 January 2015,Highly recommended for chats. But the main course was a mixed bag . Sabzee was not Upto the mark . Briyani was tasty . Worth a visit for chats
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",As good as it can be,50,18 January 2015,"When you eat here, you don't miss India and that includes:1. Taste of the chaat and other food; they have retained the flavors2. Service is as good as you find in their Indian counterparts, which means that you will at times wonder where are the guys and gals who are supposed to take the order to serve3. Chole Bhature were excellent, you run 2 marathons the next day to compensate"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pure Veg and Decent Ambience,40,17 January 2015,"Loved the Chole Bhature, relaxed in the slightly dim and wooden furniture ambience and of course a Hind speaking concierge from Jharkhand!!
Please visit this atleast once..Jai Hind!!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good north indian food,40,10 January 2015,"Kailash Parbat is a very popular restaurant and people may have to wait to get seated. However, the wait is worth it since the food is authentic north indian food. Good main courses and desserts."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent,50,8 January 2015,"4 of us had a 3 course meal for less than 60 SGD. The location is great, right Opposite Mustafa Centre. There are also number of Indian restaurants around there are only a few that are 100% Vegetarian. We tried Chilly Milly accompanied with tandoori tokri that different varieties of roti; both were excellent and recommended by staff."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good ambiance, expected more",30,30 December 2014,"Had lunch here on recommendations of a few friends. On ask in the waiter for the specials, he insisted all the items were special. Either he did not know what a special was or there wasn't one in the first place. The food was generally very good. We wanted to try Sindhi food and since our waiter wasn't particularly helpful we ordered foods with Sindhi on its name. Eat here if you know which Sindhi food you want to try out."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian Restaurent to hangout with,40,29 December 2014,Chola Bhatura and similar snacks offered by this restaurant are quite nice. The interiors were nice. Best part was it is adjoining to the Grand Chancellor hotel where we stayed
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellence in Food.,50,25 December 2014,"Excellent food - with SO MANY options! There is something for everyone - from spicy Indian food (chaat, etc.) to classic, but very tasty, Western food (sandwiches)! Fast and wonderful service - everyone is always so happy to serve us. Not too expensive and absolute value for money! Brilliant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,50,21 December 2014,Very good and tasty Indian food. Staff is very fast and efficient. I had lunch and dined at this hotel most of the times....At this hotel you dont miss India and India food. A very good vegeterian option.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent chaat house, do not fall for the Punjabi Dhaba promo",30,19 December 2014,"Our son recommended this outlet for chaat. We ordered a chaat platter, which was excellent. That is what it is good at and one should stick to that.We saw a promo of the week on our table - Punjabi Dhaba at lunch. We greedily went for 'sarson ka saag' (mustard spinach) with 'makai ki roti' (corn bread) & gajar ka halwa (carrot dessert) and lassi.I mentioned to our son that the Punjabi Dhaba was a failure. His immediate response was, 'you failed falling for Punjabi food in a Bombay savoury (chaat) house. Sure our fault. The stuff was not fit for human consumption - Yucky. The service staff was friendly but casual. Chaat very good to excellent, it gets average on account of poor Dhaba."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, clean and helpful",50,19 December 2014,I visited kailash parbat restaurant on serangoon road Singapore with my kid who does not eat spicy food. The restaurant was able to customise their menu to suit his taste. We took him there twice thereafter. The ambience is clean and hygienic. The food is tasty and they have very good options within Indian food. Kailash parbat is famous for its chat but I didn't try that. I tried North Indian and it was good. The staff is helpful and able to comprehend our needs. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent chaat house,30,15 December 2014,"We were craving for chaat. Our son recommended we try their recent one opened at Syed Alwi Road. Chaat platter covered everything we needed and salted lassi - was just right.We were tempted by a promotion, which the waiter said was for just this week at Mon to Fri lunch only - Punjabi Dhaaba - Sarson ka saag with makai di roti. That was a disaster!I messaged my son - chaat was very good but saag roti failed! His reply. ""You failed for having fallen for it in a Bombay chaat house"".My response, ""I should have known better, they had a disclaimer on the picture on the table promo 'presentation only for illustration purposes'. Saag seemed canned and makai roti mixed with white flour - not fit for human consumption. We should have stuck to chaat."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hungry to have Indian pure Veg Chat items......,40,5 December 2014,"Needless to say, if you want to have Chat items having same taste of India, you must have your supper / dinner at Kailash Parbat. Yummy chat items are really mouth watering."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Veg. Food Restaurants in Singapore.,40,2 December 2014,"Finding good Indian Veg Food in Singapore can be a tedious job. Out of 3-4 restaurants we tried, we find this restaurant better than others. Quality wise n quantity wise if you are 3-4 persons then you can have tummy full dinner or lunch along with Pani poori or chaat within 100 SD ,above all no extra charges for home delivery if ordered from anywhere in Singapore.One can visit little India and nearby places but the strong smell of other food varieties might have confined our search for other outlets. Once finalized we relied on this and had home delivery thus saved to n fro taxi charges.Therefore one must rely on personal instincts before jumping to any exclusive conclusion."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Food,50,29 November 2014,"Great food, especially the khichdi is really nice. Hare Bhare kebabs are one of my favorites, Ambiance is also nice for dine in."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",MY ONE OF THE BEST INDIAN VEG. MEAL,50,30 October 2014,I was here with my family on my Diwali vacation. we had gone four time to the same restaurant for our indian veg. food. It was best in Indian test and the chaat was awesome.we really enjoyed a all our meals and thanks to the helping staff. The ambiance is average and it was clean. On our special request the chef and cooked non spicy food for children and we are glad to them. located opposite to mustufa center.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good resto for Indian food,40,30 October 2014,"Being a vegetarian and Indian, my first choice was Kailash Parbat and I was quite satisfied with its food quality and taste. Pure Veg food and typically for Indians. U get good quality Punjabi food and other Indian food as well."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Great food, Lousy service",40,29 October 2014,"Set right in the heart of Little India, kailash parbat is one of the better upmarket restaurants. I dined there a couple of times(2 lunches and 1 dinner to be precise) and the food always blew me away. It's a vegetarian restaurant so don't expect to have tangri and kebabs at this place. The ambience is good, prices are okay too but what sucks the most is the cust service. The waiters are rude, don't repeat the orders and seem uninterested in doing their jobs. We still kept going to the same place as we were dead tired after our visits everyday and did not want to experiment. P.S. - Avoid the chaat here. Not worth it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Indian food,50,28 October 2014,The menu has quite a bit of variety.we tried north Indian food and also chaat like bhel.sevpuri.etc. the beverages like lassi.juices etc.the food was good.and reasonably priced.the place is bang opposite mustafa mall.very hygienic.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",go there if you are craving Indian food,30,24 October 2014,"Went to Kailash Parbat once after moving to Singapore. The food was just about average. Not as good as what you get at Kailash Parbat in India. However the food here is really costly. The staff is helpful but there is definitely hygiene issue, place can do with some cleaning and same goes for cutlery. Expensive compared to other Indian restaurants in the area."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best for vegetation food in Singapore,50,10 October 2014,"Must visit,and a real life saver for a foodie,for niche veg food,full course meals.I'm eating here for last 3 days and I n awed by such delicious food"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice ambience & hospitality with great food,40,7 October 2014,"We happened to be in this chain's outlet in Syed Alwi Road this weekend, which was not planned for, but just stepped in. The staff were prompt to attend to us as well as offered us better seating as soon as there was one vacant, as the restaurant was quite packed. The food tasted great, we tried new combinations like Diwani Handi, Hariyali Naan. It's priced a bit on the higher side; maybe they also need to improve on acoustics of the seating area as it seems to be noisy if people around start to talk a lot..overall we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, above all the prompt fast service in spite of the flow of guests"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great food and helpful staff,40,6 October 2014,Good atmosphere with mainly Indian families. Staff were helpful and good. Really enjoyed the food and would recommend to people especially vegetarians.

Paneer (cheese) Batura y Chole3. Ras Malai4. Bhelpuri.The place has no ambience. Went to wash hands..wash basin was dirty. The waiters are always in a hurry in a bid to make you empty your table as soon as one has finished eating.Prices, quite reasonable.Do I recommend? yes, especially for the deserts.Will I return? Yes, most definitely."

The taste was really great for all dishes. The pani puri pani was not that great. We gave this feedback and was very well accepted.
Recommended!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average food and service,30,15 September 2014,"Been here once for dine in and once home delivery. Evrything we had, tastes avegrage nothing special. Service just average. Lot of paneer(cottage cheese) options in the menu and, all paneer dishes tastes almost same. Too many spices in everything. Chaats are not bad but again, nothing special. Puri for pani puri could be alot better. I would only recommend their chana bhatura which actully tastes good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best chats and snacks,50,11 September 2014,"Kailash parbat is known for its yummy chats. We tried twice on its outlet opposite mustafa centre, it was indeed delicious. Chat platter is highly recommended, they give 4 varities in platter.Also their must try is Chole bhatoore and Malai Rabri. Rabri is excellent and fresh.Worth a visit with family for quick snacks."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food with very good ambience,40,31 August 2014,"I have visited Kailash Parbat on multiple occassions with famly, friends during different times like lunch, evening snacks and dinner. the ambience is very good here compared to many other restaurants in the surrounding areas. The service is also good. The place is nice and clean.They have the chats as well as regular ala carte menu. The staff is helpful. Once I wanted to order a Sindhi dish and the waiter was good enough to suggest that it is very spicy an unless I really wanted to give it a try, I should stay away from it.I have tried chats here. They are good. You cannot compare them with what is available in places like Goa & Mumbai. But they are one of the best in Singapore. The quantity is good. There was only one instance when I went for a dinner just before diwali and felt the service was impacted. Probably it was too crowded. Inspite of asking the waiter to serve the soup after finishing the chat, somehow soup ended on the table before the chat was served. The reason given was the chat counter was too busy and our order was still being served.I would definitely recommend this place for those people who are pure vegetarians. If you want to spend a quite evening without being disturbed in the crowded little India side, this place is good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible food,20,24 August 2014,"After reading good reviews and upon being suggested by a friend, went here for dinner. What followed was terrible .First up - The ambience is very good for an Indian restaurant in Singapore. Service is reasonably fast and efficient. That's where the good part ends. Now coming to food, we ordered Pani poori - very averageTikki chaat - terrible Pav Baaji - reasonably goodThai noodles -Had so much oil that you can cook for entire week for 1 person and very spicyBiryani - spicyMango lassi - reasonably goodWill never visit again."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",vegetarian indian dream,50,20 August 2014,"We returned to this little haven on a hot day. What a great place to call in for a snack, cold drink or full on main meal pigout. The food is top quality, service is amazing and even the decor is streets above all the other indian restaurants in Little India. The Chaat is just so fresh and the drinks are works of art. Price is very reasonable."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Veg Restaurant in SG,50,16 August 2014,"Undoubtedly best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.Restaurant is bit expensive but the helpings are large.Ambience:Very GoodService: Very Good. Staff is courteous. Must Try:Starters: Kailash club special sandwich, Chaat items like Bhel and Paani puri Drink: Sweet LassiMain Course: Hyderabad BiryaniNote: Avoid Sundays because of crowd in Little India."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best food!,40,30 July 2014,"Good ambience and the food was amazing. Best samosa chaat and dahi puri i have ever had.
but it was too expensive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Was expecting good quality,20,23 July 2014,"Not sure if I say poor would be fair but to my surprise it was poor at least what we ordered was not tasty at all, happened to visit kailash parbar in syed alvi road singapore in the evening on a weekday, ordered pani puri and it was awful to the core, its meant to be good for chats but I felt like I was eating plastic puris they were that hard I could feel they were not fresh at all they were literally like plastic, and the taste wasn't good, I couldn't chew in my mouth coz it wasn't even breaking it was that hard some weird taste, decided I will never eat pani puri ever in this place again, but I am assuming other dishes and roti currys will be good as they are served all day.Wouldn't recommend for pani puri at all"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat pata chats and great food,50,17 July 2014,"We live in Singapore and love Kailash Parbat. Their chats specially the Pani Puri are amazing other than the Pani Puri we will often indulge in their mouth watering Bhel puri, Samosa Chat or Alu Chat as a snack. The Chilly Paneer is also a special favourite.The helpings are large so you should share your food so that you get to taste a variety of their delicate chats and sweets. Wash it down with a cool lassi or lime juice or lime soda and that's what I would call a lovely indian snack.Meals at Kailash Parbat are excellent too and if you have the time do take the time to enjoy a good meal at Little India. The have a new outlet in the works at Changi coming up soon."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best food in singapore,50,14 July 2014,"fresh and tasty food. good portion size. friendly staff. dahi puri has now become my personal favourites among the chaats, pani-puri and papdi chaat is also nice. excellent ambience. hygenic and clean."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food but a little pricey,50,5 July 2014,The kofta dilbahar is excellent among the subzis. The chaats are very good too. No South Indian fare though. Bhel puri and pani puri as well as corn basket chaat are very nice. It could get very crowded sometimes. Food a little on the spicy side. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Really tasty food.,50,9 June 2014,The restaurant provides very good Indian food starting from chaats to paneer sabzi and biryani. It may seem a little costly but the food is really worth it. The ambience is also very good.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food at High price,40,9 June 2014,The food was simply awesome. So was the variety. but had to pay a good price for that.. The Ambiance of the restaurant was excellent.. was very clean.. the Staff was good.. service was good.. but Slow.. Should try Chole Bhature Platter.. Maybe on of their specialties.. and if u are looking for Indian Snacks.. This place is your choice.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",dint feel like i m out of India,40,9 June 2014,Me and my husband visited kailash parbat in Little India for dinner. The moment we entered it gave us an Indian feel. I felt like i am in mumbai and am having dinner. Usually the service in kailash parbat is slow .... I am saying this out of experience .. and the same thing was here .but the food was yummy .. we had a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the core. Highly recommended to all chaat lovers and punjabi food lovers ...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",great food - poor service,30,7 June 2014,"The food was amazing, but service was ""different"": when we asked the waitress what side order she would take, she answered, none, I don't like the food in this restaurant.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A Perfect Restaurant for Any Indian or International Traveller,50,4 June 2014,"It had been more than a week of searching to find a perfect restaurant with good ambience , cleanliness and hospitality at par .The Search eneded at Kailash Parbat , we reached a bit early at 19:00 Hrs recomended as it becomes really busy post 20:00 Hrs .A Perfect Host , good service with a smile . The Food is hygenic , freshly cooked and tastes yummm . Its more of soul filling than stomach filling .We took some motichoor ladoos as well they were by far the best what I found in Singapore .If you are looking for a cheap deal this not a place for you but if you are looking for value for money then certainly a must visit .Above All the Sindhi Delicacies were a Santa coming front of us ."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Really nice!,40,28 May 2014,"We went there for lunch.. Great staff, nice food, but a bit expensive for international travellers. Since we were twelve of us, it did not seem as expensive as it actually is.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Yes for the best in Class Street Food,40,28 May 2014,"You name it and there! You have the tongue titilling, very nicely presented food ranging from Pani Puri to Pav Bhaji.
There is a College Sandwich which sure would remind you of your college cafe's. Tastes really nice."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Expensive,30,22 May 2014,"This is one expensive restaurant in little India , to pay s$ 160 for food for four person is very expensive for an average restaurant. That's more than what one pay for 5 star hotel in India. Food is okay , their chats are good . Service is not like upmarket restaurant. overall avoid if have less budget for a restaurant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",very good food great place,40,22 May 2014,"Excellent quality food.
Great staff very helpful.
Price is decent.
Best food....has been always amazing.
Highly recommended....."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible Terrible Terrible....a full grown dead Cockroach in Curry,10,20 May 2014,"We visited this restaurant on 13 May 14 at around 2100 Hrs, We went to its branch at Kailash Parbat Restaurant, 93 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207669 for dinner and ordered a platter of Chhola Bhattura, Hyderabdi biryani and plain yoghurt.To the worst of our experience, when we just started eating and had half a bhattura,in chhola curry I found a big dead cockroach. We reported the same to restaurant manager and he had no explanation other than just sorry. It was a major hygiene issue and even I had starting symptoms of mouth ulcer after that food.Me and my family were really very very upset with the incident as we are pure vegeterian and could not have food that night. My 6 year old daughter slept hungry that night. It spoiled our night and my daughter could not have food properly throughout the stay in Singapore in any of the restaurant due to the same suspicion.We reported the incident to the hotel admin (Mr Amit on admin@kailashparbat.com.sg sales@kailashparbat.com.sg) that night itself but his response was again just a sorry. Terrible restaurant and average food....."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good chats, value wise remain unconvinced",30,18 May 2014,"Went back to Kailash Parbat recently, wanting to have chats for Sunday brunch. While good and consistent food taste wise, I do think that they need to rethink their pricing a little bit. 13-15$ for a vegetable dish, 3-4$ for a cup of instant coffee and 8$ for a small serving of Kulfi probably pushes it a little bit. We tried their signature Chola Bhatura, and it is a stand out good dish. Their shahi dum aloo left a lot to be desired - chaat items are consistent as always and service was good all around."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",NOT BAD!!,40,15 May 2014,"Food is good, however it takes a while for your food to be served, quite expensive compared to other restaurants near by! however have to admit the Chat's were nice. and the food portion is quite small, not recommended for big family!pricing is a little too high and the service staff tend to ignore your preferences if the restaurant is full!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good on taste, but expensive - and they home deliver",40,14 May 2014,Had been struggling to find some north Indian food near orchard road and was advised to try this restaurant in little india. I can say it was a decision well made. The restaurant has courteous staff and decent hygiene. Normal dishes start at average of SGD 10 for main course and the menu has sizeable variety. Six of us spend around 100 SGD for main course but the food was good so didn't mind paying that much. Getting there from orchard road took about 10 minutes and its well connected by MRT. Overall a good place to eat and yes they also deliver at home...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Must visit for people missing indian food in Singapore,50,10 May 2014,What more on a holiday could you ask for than good food.!!.. for all veg indian food lovers this place is a must visit in singapore. if you are missing indian food and want to get full with great food this is a place. Great service by the staff. Excellent job they do especially at weekend evening when there is Hours of waiting. But still they get you served asap. Well do not miss it if you like chaat and other indian snaks. everything they prepare has Indian essence and is amazing. 10 on 10 :)
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",my dinning experience,50,6 May 2014,dahi papdi chat and the pani puri served in Singapore branch was at par with any other branches in india. Chass served here is also great and reminds you that whether you are having your dinner in India or singapore.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good place for Vegetarian Indian Food.,40,1 May 2014,"We went to this place on two consecutive days. On First day we wanted to order some chinese dishes, But the manager declined saying that Chinese Chef was absent. Next day the chinese chef was there. All the items there were good. Starters, Main Course and Chinese dishes all were very good. Service was a touch slow but still nice place to have authentic Indian cuisine."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great place and good food,40,19 April 2014,"Excellent quality food.
Great ambience
Great staff very helpful and kind
Price is decent
I will say must for anyone looking out for indian food at little india"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Restaurant but bad Service,40,19 April 2014,"I have been there just once and will never go back, I had visited during dinner on a weekday, but the service staff was too slow, there was not much of crowd too.We have to remind the service staff about our order as they are a bit forgetful.Recommended but only visit this restaurant if you have ample time to spend"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good food for North Indian Vegetarian,40,18 April 2014,"Like I had reviewed for MTR as one of the best South Indian Vegetarian place, this is the best place for North Indian food. Like MTR, this place is also on expensive side, but the ambience is better."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Wonderful experience,50,16 April 2014,Best food.... Has been always Amazing experience... Would definately go again n again... Highly recommended...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Combination of great food and hygiene,50,16 April 2014,The best veg indian restaurant in little india with a wide variety of food and a cozy ambience. The staff is suggestive and friendly. Great place to visit for chaats. They also the an impressive range of mocktails. Would surely visit again with friends and family in the next trip to Singapore.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent Food & Service,30,12 April 2014,"It's one of the few places in Singapore that offers a considerable variety of chaat and by virtue of that, has good awareness here. However, both the food and service are pretty inconsistent - could be great one day and a downer the next. Their Chole Bhatura is probably the only dish that I've found to be good every single time I've had it. What they call Hyderabadi Biryani is more like Mint-Coriander rice, and their Paneer Khurchan is a heavily gravied dish, which shouldn't be the case.This branch is still okay but the one opposite Mustafa is a disaster. The staff is not receptive to feedback at all and can be quite indifferent and rude about it - maybe one of the reasons they don't offer a survey!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic food but slightly disappointing,30,11 April 2014,"I went to Kailash Parbat thinking that I will get authentic Mumbai chaat; however, was slight disappointment. The food taste was quite contrast from what is offered in India. Also, the portions where inconsistent. Further, the variety of chaat in menu card was limited. Overall, an average experience. Maybe due to the brand name, I had high hopes. For people who want to enjoy Mumbai chaat, this is place to go provided you are able to manage your expectations."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Declining quality of food coupled with bad staff attitude!,10,10 April 2014,"We have been going to Kailash parvat a number of times since they have opened. However, the quality of food especially in this outlet (Grand Chancellor Hotel) has been on a declining trend ever since! The last we went there was last week - 2 April and after that we have sworn it off our list!For starters we ordered pani puri - which had a stale smell like the oil used to fry it was old. When we pointed it out the staff, his answer was - ""No one else has said that, so you are wrong""Secondly, we ordered food without onions and garlic and sure enough the food arrives with big pieces of onion. Thankfully it was big enough to be visible to the staff as well so he could not say that we are delusional! Without getting into too many details, the staff's attitude despite this mistake was very arrogant. The manager came in after 10 mins of argument with the staff and after being repeatedly asked for. Although his attitude was much better, the damage was done and could not be redeemed. We paid for our hardly eaten food and left immediately.While Kailash Parbat is off our list, I do know quite a few restaurants now that offer much better food minus the attitude. Try Komala Vilas in Race course road for pure veg food or Bikanerwala, Raj or Bombay cafe for better chaat options."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",most hygenic eat out in little india,50,7 April 2014,the best advantage about this restaurant is that it is just in front of hotel grand chancellor where we stayed in singapore.the food is good but the price value is too high.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the best Indian meals I have ever had.,50,26 March 2014,"Nice venue, excellent service and great value. The maitre'd came to our table and explained the slight delay as one of the dishes we had ordered, the Kebab Platter, was being freshly made, but it was well worth the wait. I cannot fault any of the dishes and generous helpings too. In fact so much so that we had to put in takeaway containers and had for lunch the next day, delicious even cold. I also enjoyed the Mango Lassi. Defintely recommend Kailash Parbat Restaurant in Little India."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best food ever,50,5 March 2014,"Sandwiches and bhatura are awesome and out of the world..
Very tasty...and not expensive according to the ambience"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,40,27 February 2014,"Excellent Indian food, never disappointing. Prices are slightly expensive, but we dont mind as food quality is amazing. We are regular customers here"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian food but very expensive,40,20 February 2014,Though the food and service was very good. The prices were steep as compared to nearby Indian restaurants.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Veggie lover's Paradise!!,40,26 January 2014,"Situated in little india, this 'vegeterian' resturant is an ultimate place to satisfy your taste buds!With a very vast menu and varity of cusines, the starters will make your tongue drooling. Specially the chaats are amazing.The main course might dissappoint you a little as compared to startes, but is again not at all a bad option to try.On weekends, there is a long queue so please book table in advance else be ready to wait. Service is slow given high rush of footfall, but they will keep your cool with their warm behaviour.Average meal for a couple costs SGD 30-40.In all, a must try for all vegetarians."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic North Indian Food,40,21 January 2014,"Hi Foodies, If you are looking for nice cozy environment to try Indian food in Singapore, then look no further. KP brings in authentic north Indian taste for you. Staff wears a smile and often give you freebie starters, of that you have to be a regular by the way ;)Chole Bhature, Baby Corn Basket Chaat and Biryanis are a much try. If you wish to have some thing light they do serve sandwiches and snacks through the day. The only down side is you may have to wait a bit during weekends to get a table. Keep hogging..:)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian restaurant in Little India,30,13 January 2014,"We were in Little India on the evening of the Dec 2013 riots. Walking around the place in the evening, we were surprised by the poor quality of restaurants and eateries in Little India. Being a Sunday, it was crowded and thankfully we spotted this restaurant which is a reasonably well known chain from India. While its facade looks average, the place is very nice from inside with efficient service, good food and stands out as an oasis where one can have a good quality meal in a comfortable, safe ambiance. While not a good place by itself, it stands miles above its local competition. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch/dinner in Little India."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best indian meal of my life till now,50,13 January 2014,have been to many resturants all over India but the taste of food i had at Kailash Parbat in Singapore is the best till now
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lost In Translation,30,11 January 2014,"Sindhi food is generally very unique and probably one of the best Indian option. But needs special culinary skills . KP though being Sindhi food, lacks altogether the Sindhi menu and Sindhi flavors. There are few options on the menu, but that is not what one would expect from such a restaurant.Even the least of Sindhi Paratha or Rajma or Sayal Bhaji is all missing.Overprices and is ok for perhaps one visit, till the restaurant gets all the sindhi dishes on the menu.Visited the one near the Mustafa this time, but have been to the Temple hugging one in the past. Both almost same."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good decor but expensive,30,10 January 2014,Found the place to be neat and clean. Decor is quite nice. And good location in Little India. Also good variety of chaat options if u are in the mood for something different from the usual meals or heavy snacks. but price wise it is on the expensive side. So if u are on a tight budget better check the menu before settling in.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Chaat and North Indian veg food,50,9 January 2014,"Have been to this restaurant quite a lot of times and their food is tasty and up to the mark. Not to be missed are the Chaat platter, samosas and chola bhaturas. Great ambiance and great food!!!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste Inconsistent,30,8 January 2014,"I believe this place has undergone some rapid change in staff, including the chef and manager. While the service staff are generally nice, the change in chef was a huge disappointment for a period of time. Food taste and quality went down drastically; to the extent that we thought that the food served was spoilt. Before that, I used to go down there almost every Saturday and Sunday for brunch. After a long hiatus, I decided to try them out a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the food tastes really good now. I wish this consistency is maintained. Ambiance is quite good and the place is easy to locate. My suggestion is to try the restaurant neat the temple and not the one behind Mustafa."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",excellent veg indian food,40,4 January 2014,"this place is very close to Mustafa on syed Alwi road. There are many other indian restaurant around. Place is generally full. Had dinner twice at this place. Excellent food. You can get many snacks items like bhel, sevpuri, gulab jamun, samosa, sandwich etc also along with the regular vegetarian items in a restaurant. Food - quality and taste wise is excellent. Service is excellent. Staff is great. we tried north indian food and really liked it.This restaurant is visited mostly by Indian tourist and Indians staying in Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect,50,11 December 2013,Eating here since last two years. The quality of food has never varied. The chola bhatura are best in Singapore. So is the Mushroom corm club sandwich. Chat platter is good. Rest everything is upto mark. Ambience is of fine dining.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Skip the falooda, rest is good.",30,23 November 2013,"This is the restaurant outlet across from Mostaffa not the one of the main street. Bhel puri, chaat was good but the falooda was disappointing. Overall a clean restaurant and service was prompt. The mithai was good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent choice.,50,23 November 2013,"I was overwhelmed to see the branch of Mumbai's famous chain just opp to my hotel. Tasted Chhola Bhatura, Soup, Sindhi Curry and Malai Kulfi. Awsome authentic taste."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,40,23 October 2013,While visiting little India we happened to see the restaurant and went for dinner. The place is spacious and tables well laid out. We had sev puri and enjoyed it. Kids enjoyed the paneer dish with various types of rotis. Overall all of us enjoyed the food. Service was good but I felt it was a bit slow but the overall experience was good
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Amazing food n amazing setting,50,12 October 2013,"Amazing amazing food with amazing service...just can't stop myself repeating their chats, bhatura variety and grill sandwich..their service consistently impressed with the food and service. This place is affordable and delicious. I've taken large groups here and they handle it beautifully. We love that we live close enough to be repeat customers. The setting is very very royal and food is great"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food - The place is a bit smelly though,30,1 October 2013,"We were looking for a good indian place to have a quick bite at around 11 in the morning in the Little India area and decided to visit this place, having seen it so many times from the bus. The first impression as we entered the restaurant was about the strange pungent smell that was there in the restaurant (might have been because it was quiet early in the day). This was to a point that we thought of leaving without eating.We did stay and ordered. We ordered 2 dishes, 'Bhel Puri' & 'Regular Batore', though we were served Dahi Puri instead of Bhel Puri (and I am not someone who sends things back, afterall we are there for the good time). The food did actually turn out quiet good. The Dahi Puri's flavor was a bit all over the place and the chutneys and sweet yogurt didnt complement each other too well. The Batoore were a total treat. We loved it. Though we may not go back to this place (despite of the good food) because of the whole smell in the place."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A good meet-up place with delicious vegetarian food.,40,1 October 2013,"Going to Kailah Parbat for our meet-up was a wonderful suggestion from a non-vegetarian.
My first time here, I love the décor and ambience of the restaurant. We have a wonderful night chit-chatting and savouring the delicious vegetarian food here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Brilliant As Always,50,28 September 2013,"super duper service and fantastic food, good people. felt as if we were back home. had a good time with my family....."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",I loved the Food away from India,50,19 September 2013,I liked the ambiance of the place when i was just returning back form Mustafa i saw this and thought give it a try... I just had a Bhatura but tell frankly could not finish it... The only problem i faced was they did not accept travel card saying they accept only on bills above SGD 20 or more and my bill was SGD16.80.. They should think over that policy as i was all alone so there is never be any chances to get it over SGD 20... Shall come again sure next time come to Singapore... :)
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Vegetarian Cuisine - pricey,40,7 September 2013,"Go to Kailash Parbat for an authentic indian street food experience in a restaurant setup. Chaats and paani puris are really nice. But my favourite remains the chole bhatura and gulab jamun. A must try for each visit.Dinner for 2 costs about 30sgd++ Service is prompt. I was impressed that the manager cleaned the table when he noticed his cleaning staff were quite busy. Food was served within 5-10 minutes.The ambience is average. Though yhe interiors are done nicely, it doesn't g8ve a traditional Indian feel. Also, I personally found it a but noisy (enough to drown the background instrumentals that I like so much).Overall, a place for authentic indian street food with good service. But pricey and mildly noisy."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent but pricy!,40,20 August 2013,Try the chats! It's the best u will get in singapore. Also the dinner items are delicious! A bit pricy when compared to other nearby hotels. Try the lassi as well. 2-3 plates of chat n lassi itself can cost u around 30-40 sgd!!! Good to go occasionally!! 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Highly priced,30,10 August 2013,We ordered for home delivery today...we wanted to eat paneer chilly from a very long time but we were totally disappointed...it was really stale and pathetic in taste.. With such highly priced food we didn't expect such disappointing dish..!!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Takeaway,40,30 July 2013,We picked up Papri chats as a takeaway and four plates set us back about 33 Sin Dollars. The portions were very generous and the taste delicious.The restaurant itself is quite large
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat in Singapore,50,18 July 2013,Excellent India Like food. Great Bhaturas and excellent Chats. Compared to India its costly but its worth the cost getting great food in Singapore
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",BEST PURE VEGETARIAN INDIAN RESTAURANT,40,8 July 2013,"It is best authentic north Indian restaurant in Singapore. Some dishes are taste even better than available in India. Many varieties such as chat platter, Kulfi falooda, Live counter are great. Rates on higher side but its not india its singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good only for fast food..,30,30 June 2013,"We visited the restaurant over the weekend when its highly chaotic and crowded in Little India area of Singapore. The atmosphere wasn't different inside. It was well crowded and we had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated. Never mind. We got well seated and staff was friendly too. Well, not attentive enough as compared to what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Any ways, as we made ourselves comfortable with few sips of water, we saw the ambiance was nice but hardly noticeable in the crowd. We ordered a few snacks, followed by the main course. I must mention, its a pure vegetarian restaurant, so if you fancy Indian non-veg selection, its not for you. Talking of the food, the snacks and fast food selection is nice and would remind you of food street in India, if you have been there and tried that. As of main course, its a total disappointment and doesn't satisfy any parameter of a good fine meal. Service was below average, may be because they weren't well equipped to handle crowd. So, if you are going down to this place, my recommendation would be to try street food option on menu, like Chole Bature and Chaat. If you are out to enjoy a lavish meal, you can safely avoid it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Home FOOD Away from HOME,50,27 June 2013,Kailash Parvat is a home kitchen away from home for all those Indian travellers who can adjust anything but cannot compromise on food.The best place to dine in 3 times a day to have a tastier experience.The whole staff ambience and food qualtiy is excellent.The taste is much much better than many restaurants in even India.I dont think one should try different places if staying long Infact u must repeatedly have all ur food requirement from here only leaving your fooding tension on Kailash Parvat .
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Overrated, Overpriced !",10,24 June 2013,"Kailash Parbat is highly overrated for the service, ambiance and most importantly the food it serves.Located in the heart of Little India with a finely lit up ambiance, it is sure to grab attention of on-goers (both Indian and others). It did grab our attention too for the first time I went there with my friends.Upon entering the noisy food-court like environment was a sure turn-off. I pulled my iphone to check on the decibel levels in the restaurant and no wonder it wasn’t me but it was really noisy (110 db). But looking at the number of people, it did give a sense of confidence about the place and I decided to not judge the place simply by its ambiance or comfort to my eyes/ears. We walked towards our table for 4 and we were seated in what looked like a place for not more than 2 adults. Maybe 4 kids weighing 30 kg each is what they made the table for. We successfully pushed ourselves in through the cramped up table and ordered our food. So far I was still giving the place, a second and now a third chance, banking highly on the food they will serve. After all, restaurants are meant to serve food. Other things are add-ons.After a not-so-long wait, our orders were on our table: few starters of Paneer (cottage cheese), Pani-puri, few drinks (around SG $5 for a lime juice!!). The first few bites of food added to the severe wounds of ambiance, seating and service. There is no way there will ever be another chance if the restaurant fails at its food.Pani-poori was broken and it did not hold the masala/paanis (syrups). Other chats either were tasteless or excessively spicy. Paneer was half cooked and hastily massaged with a layer of masala/garnishing. There was nothing to complain about the roti (bread), but that’s no rocket science for any restaurant. The core strength of this place as claimed is their Chat (snacks) , which was nowhere close to being even half good as what we get at any Indian restaurant.To my surprise every time I went there with an open mind to accept the place and see if anything has changed, I returned with disappointment. I made around 4 visits and now I am writing this review.The final blow was the bill which looked like injustice to what we just experienced. Overpriced!In summary: The place is a lit up version of a food court experience with food half as good as what you get in food courts, as noisy as it is in food courts and you pay three to four times of what you will otherwise spend. Food quality depicts the haste of serving you and pushing you out of the restaurant to get the next in line seated.Maybe a few non-indians may even get close to liking this place. I wont blame them, its just Indian food for them and nothing to compare against.My verdict – avoid ! Save your ears, eyes, tongue and hey, your wallet too."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Flavours away from Home.,30,23 June 2013,"Awesome food - was homesick on my singapore trip with respect to Indian food. Kailash Parbat tickled my taste buds like never before. The chats reminded us of the Kailash Parbat we visit back home in Colaba, Mumbai. The glitch was that it was understaffed, hence servicr was a tad slow - the chef had to bring out the dishes on a few occasions. Management needs to work on the same."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Waste of time and money,20,5 June 2013,Not worth it.....food is not that great....if you ask for alterations (like leass spices and all) they will never follow it!Home delivery time is 1.5 hrs and food never reaches before 2 hrs.Once i even received my entire order with out salt n that too after waiting for 2 hrs.Bikanerwala does much better job.Papri and rice flakes which they use in their chats are alwys soggy and not crispy.Boondi raita is a mix of very less curd and lots of red chilli.Masala lassi is again filled with red chilli only.Staff is most of the time too hay wired to be organised and attend to guests properly that can be beacuse vegetarian people dont have much options.Definitely not recommended if you have time and patience to wait and look around for another decent place.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best avoidable indian restaurant in singapore,20,18 May 2013,"After coming back from India recently my taste buds were tickling for some good indian chatpatta food ... Looking at the lay out of the restaurant and what I heard about the restaurant in radio advertising ( Of course they are paid) ... I thought this is the place best suited to give me the same experience what I had in Delhi few days back however to my surprise the food is not at all good ... Not fresh... Oily ... Forget about the taste. Even the tea took almost 15 mins to come and was clearly not fresh as I could see the clotted layer on top, when I asked to the person serving the tea..... Is this Fresh ? His reply was yes the tea is fresh however it's just served late!!!!! The Ambiance is nice however to get repeat customers ambiance ONLY will not help. For the time being I am not returning back to this place hope they make some changes.Thanks "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Highly overated, below average food.",20,8 May 2013,"I went to Kailash Parbat for lunch during my visit to Singapore. I ordered a 'Thali'. First the waiter said Thali is only upto 3.00 PM, I reminded him that time is 2.50 PM. He agreed to provide me with Thali.Food quality was average, very oily and spicy. Lassi was very sweet. Customers have no choice of getting plain or salty Lassi. I was provided heavily buttered roti. I was told that's how bread is served in Thali.I think its best avoidable if you do not like oily and heavy indian food!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Kailash Parbat Singapore near to ParkRoyal Hotel,40,3 May 2013,We have a wonderful time in dining at Kailash parbat Singapore. Its very close to the shopping malls. Also the food there is very Authentic with North Indian / Chinese dishes. We were really happy with the service we got and the food quality..
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian regional snacks,40,16 April 2013,"Apart from South Indian breakfast restaurants, most Indian eateries in Little India replicate authentic Indian cuisine. Kailash Parbat, serves snacks from a particular region in India. Their branches in Mumbai are very popular and this branch has mostly maintained the standards. You have to know what to order. Skip the Pani Puri and the Pao Bhaji, the Ragda Pattice, the Chole and the chats are great. They have two outlets now, one opposite Mustafa. The staff are friendly and helpful."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",North Indian Street Food Favourites - Good food but not so reasonable,40,16 April 2013,"If you want to savour typical North Indian street and junk food favourites - this is the place to go.The selection of ""Chaats"" is very good and the 'Methi Chola - Bhatura' was amazing.Go with a good appetite though - you will feel so full afterwards that you will want someone to drag you home!.I had a small issue with the mango lassi which was sour due to the yogurt sitting out for too long. It was replaced immediately with another glass which also was sour. The friendly staff offered to compensate me with complimentory dessert which I declined as I was already bursting at the seams!.Good fun sunday brunch hangout."

DO NOT EXPECT QUALITY SERVICE........its just ok."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best restaurant for vegetarians in Singapore,50,6 April 2013,"Since we are pure vegetarians and we like to have Indian food where ever we go, when we came to know about this restaurant we decided to go there.Its situated in little India. It was late when we reached. We were dead hungry and there was waiting list for more then 30 mins. It was irritating but no option. We knew Kailash parbat as its present in Mumbai at many locations and its quite good. At last when we got the seats and we ordered, thankfully order was delivered quite quickly.The food was delicious and exactly like we have in India.Everything ordered was delicious. Cost was little more but still it was worth every penny.Strongly recommended for vegetarians and also people who love Indian vegetarian spicy food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Chats in Singapore,40,17 March 2013,"Saw ""Chats""in the caption and visited this place to give a try. Ordered Samosa chat and was very good. Even Sandwich here are worth a try. Dont miss this place if you like chats :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Little variety but good food,40,13 March 2013,"The name being a popular eatery in Mumbai attracted me to this restaurant. Food was good, reasonably priced. But no great variety. Value for money indeed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lovely Restaurant and doesnt allow you to miss India,40,25 February 2013,"We had our 6 out of 9 meals at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road, Singapore. Beautiful restaurant in terms of food and menu. Menu is the same as in India and the food served is equally well made and tasty.Portions are good enough to serve 2 people and given the Singapore trend, it does the fit the average bill.Must visit hotel for all Jain & Vegetarian food lovers. Should mention about the staff at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road location - very nice and helpful staff. Ever ready to help, suggest and give their best.Keep up the good work and all the best KP !!

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible attitute of Staff,10,26 December 2012,"Hi called Kailash parbat today (26 dec 2012, 15:48) and was checking about the buffet arrangement. First of all the staff not respond and said check the website for any details. When i asked i had a bad experience last time but i hope this was just accidental so want to order again, the staff rudely ANSWER , THEN PLS DONT COME. Same happend in August when i thorw a party at KP and it was full of mismanagement. Foods was not served and most of the time many dishes not available and i was busy to greet my friends. I thought it was just bcoz of 1 staff member but now i KNOW whole KP staff is rude and no customer respect. FOOD IS LIKE NOT WORTHY AS THE PRICE ON TOP OF IT THE TERRIBLE STAFF."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, nice decor, good service (for Singapore)",50,15 November 2012,"I have visited the location on Syed Alwi road twice and thoroughly enjoyed the experience both times. The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable, the decor is pleasant and the service is pretty good (in a country notorious for horrible service). Neither my husband nor I are vegetarian, but the food is so delicious we didn't miss the meat. If you've never tried Indian vegetarian food (I'm new to it myself), I recommend the Papdi Chaat, Pani Puri, Tandoori Tokri, Khyberi kadai paneer, Lasoni dal tadka, Tarkari mandi."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is hit or miss,30,15 November 2012,"I was very excited to try this famous Indian chaat chain here in Singapore. The dahi puri was great, the chole samosa was not good. We ordered a few more dishes, they were not memorable. Overall, about 6 chaats, only one was outstanding. Very disappointing from my high expectations. The decor is great, very modern and clean. Nice dishes and good service. We won't go back, we will try some cheaper chaat places."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Street food is average,30,19 October 2012,"Their street Chaat items on their menu are elaborate, but expensive for $ 12 which is the price for a snack only...The main course is just average. Had taken my parents when they came but it do not think we would ever go back there as the food is very very average and prices overrated considering Singapore's wide choice of indian restaurants with very good food and prices.We personally would never go there given a choice."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pathetic and expensive food,20,19 September 2012,"This is pathetic restuarent and these guys are looting people in name of thier restaurent decoration. Only thier plate, table cloth and restaurent jhoomar(lighting) will attract you here.The quantity of serving plate food is too low and i feel the food was reheated food.I order bhel poori and i feel this was they pout maggi sous on it. No standard, not proper table service (very less staff in ratio, all serving staff passing ball to next if you ask something).IF YOU TRUST ME NEVER GO TO KAILASH PARBAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT TASTY AND REASONABLE RATE FOOD.I appriecite ""Kahansama"" who is just in front of this reastaurent for great taste and resonable rate."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",nice memories,40,7 August 2012,"nice memories of indian street food, which you try to avoid when in India due to the risk of upset tummy, but here you could indulge to your hearts content, quite pricey though, and taste not as 100% authentic as when in India"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","The high price of food here is only in the good looks of the food, not the taste of the food.",30,5 June 2012,"A place which deserves a miss. Just because the food is nicely decorated on your plate for you, don't make the taste nice or expensive. These guys here are literally slaughtering their customers in Singapore dollars and having the last laugh at their customers. Every Singapore dollar is now 45 rupees and to be paying s$30 for 2 plates of pain puri and a glass of lime drink equates to 1350 Indian rupees. So keep laughing guys! It's matter of time before we laugh at you."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chats are disappointing!,30,10 May 2012,Kailash parbat being an Indian chain is popular for its Chaats. Our first visit to KP (last year) made sure we are a regular visitor to this place but after that all visits have been highly disappointing.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Fast Food at its Best!,40,5 May 2012,"One of the better restaurants in Singapore serving variety of Indian Fast Food options (Chaat). From Delhi to Mumbai to Gujarat to Sindh...you have it all. And you will be surprised by the authentic flavours and taste. However, stick to safe options like Golgappe, Aloo tikki etc. New exotic options like (Masala Chhole Bhatura) could disappoint you.Range of sweets and beverages is also satisfying.Only downside is price...but should be okay for your desi craving.Note: They also have outlets in Mumbai & Hyderabad. Hyderabad (Inorbit Mall) was too disappointing...to say the least."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Punjabi food with Tang ;-),50,17 April 2012,"Though prices are going north here too,this is one place i visit atleast once a month.With family or friends.The staff is very attentive,warm and knowledgable.During Navratra-i was fasting the staff cooked lotus stem with for me with just seasoning.Felt like home.The pani-pooris, chaats, Bhaturas, weekday buffet,Samosas or the sweets, all are just awesome.The restaurant keeps the quality under check which makes my friends/relatives from various parts of the world make atleast 1 visit every visit mandatory."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Sindhi Treat,40,24 February 2012,I was surprised to find the Sindhi delicacies that too with authentic taste. I feel it's better than the one in Mumbai. Service sometime suffers during peak hours but overall a very nice Indian restaurant
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian vegetarian food!,50,24 January 2012,The chaats are great. Lunch buffet is good. Must try esp if u want to try something different from the usual north and south Indian food available in Singapore.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Chat... Good Bhatura,50,5 January 2012,"The chat quality is very good. Should try the Chat Palette !! I like the way they serve the Pani Poori, however the filling is mostly potatoes. They have a variety of Bhatura - avoid Cheese one. Rest are okay, if you don't mind the oily ones. They also have some Rajdhani lotus stem based ones. I liked them. Good spread and worth the price.Better eat in house and not try to pack their breads to eat at home / beach."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker night and day,40,16 October 2018,"We visited at night and for lunch. More atmosphere and busier at night, whereas Tekku Centre, in Little India and Amoy St Hawkers both were better at lunchtime. Had delicious chilli crab from store 42(?). Tucked in corner. Store beside, 43 Indian Kitchen served us best Indian we had in Singapore. Chicken tikka and fish kebab roll was the perfect lunch choice.Clean and spacious and only two stops on MRT from our hotel."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Just gets better each time,50,30 August 2018,"Been here many a time over the years, used to be very popular with local families, food was served on banana leaves and apart from chopsticks, the utensil of choice was your hands.Roll on 20 years, the hawker stands are all on the outside of the open air area, pick a stand/food style you like and enjoy, some places give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready.We arrived as a party of 7, all wanting different food, this place is ideal, just getting a table is the hardest part. My favourite stand is no 31, try the stingray, absolutely fantastic, with seafood fried rice and morning glory veg dripping with garlic. Indonesian, Thai, local Singapore and Indian as well as traditional and specialised Chinese is all available.Prices are getting higher, but as usual we over ordered, about $25 Singapore dollars for a fabulous meal"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night eats - the best!,50,28 August 2018,"There are not many outdoor hawker centres in Singapore now - this might be the last one. Great atmosphere, lots of yummy food and so very fun. It can get pricey so it's not a ""cheap eat"" anymore, but so worthwhile. It's featured in ""CRAZY RICH ASIANS""... added bonus! So cool to promote the hawkers. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great choice of food,40,19 August 2018,Visited at about 8.00 on a Friday night and really struggled to get a table. You can obviously eat from any of the stalls but the tandoori on the outside was great for authentic Indian food.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too Commercialised,10,8 May 2018,Visited Newtons Food Centre tonight. Very dissatisfied. So over commercialised its lost the Songapore charm and feel. Vendors are pushy and disinterested in being polite and happy. Food very average or not good. Can't say much for this place or any of the hawker centres we've heard so much about. Wouldn't recommend or return to any of them sadly. Visited Singapore a couple of times now and have to the food is definitely not as it used to be

There’s is not one particular stall I can recommend... just try as many as you possibly can! I used to obsess over the sambal stingray, the chilli crab (a fraction of the price you will pay at Boat Quay, and wayyyyyy tastier!) the grilled prawns, cockles, cereal prawn... amazing!!! But now I’ve gone a bit veggie/veganish, I’m now obsessed with all the amazing veggie dishes! Baby Kai lan, Sambal kangkong - the spicy green stringy one (you’ll know when you see it) veggie fried rice and noodles. Veggie Thai food, tom yum, salad, to name a couple. Roti prata and dal or veggie curries. Fresh coconut water. Omg the list just goes on!!! If you are in singapore VISIT VISIT VISIT!!! I didn’t see the lady with the beehive hair this time, but for the seafood eaters, look out for her, they do the BEST sambal stingray :) "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced,20,24 March 2018,"Whilst not a complete ripoff, the dishes are definitely way overpriced.For example:Chicken Fried rice Newton: $20Chicken Fried rice Tanglin Mall: $6Food quality is only average, or maybe it’s the price leaving a slightly bitter taste.There are a lot of locals there, which indicates they are either happy to be charged 3-4 times more, or they are getting a different priced menu to the tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food centre,40,12 March 2018,"Newton was easy to get to from the train and well laid out. We went for lunch on Monday so quiet a few were closed but had some great Chinese bbq, Satays and Indian food good value and quality. Would be better when more stalls are open so worth the trip would be good at night "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Black pepper crab,40,8 February 2018,"I've been to this place many times. I think tourist have to choose the good seller than the bad one in here. I always come to the lady that have shop in the middle of the hawker at the right end (forgot the hawker number). Her menu for the crab has a price also for small, medium or large so it's a fixed price. She always give me a small price for a medium crab. I paid S$ 42 for a medium black pepper crab which is quite good. The taste is delicious as well."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go a s a tourist as they rip you off,10,2 February 2018,"It's one of those places you feel you should go but it's expensive and they load the prices for tourists, only ever go for fixed prices and avoid the ones marked that you pay by weight as they always add S$20 on the price. Meal was very average to be honest."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Well, not much, very touristy ",20,26 January 2018,"Honestly, average quality food here. Or I should say in general Singapore local dishes is not that good. If you been to northern Malaysia, that will be a real deal.Expensive, tasteless, dont have any distinctive characteris in the food. Well, if you dont mind the above, please visit then. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience,30,20 January 2018,"A local friend brought us here for a midnight snack, and it was fun with a lively atmosphere. I stuck to the ""carrot cake"" as it seemed a safe option, and it was actually really tasty (I will try to make it at home now I think). My boyfriend ate loads of things, BBQ stingray amongst others, and he raved about it although the day after he really suffered with a bad stomach upset, he thinks it was the mutton soup but it's hard to say as we were eating out lots and he eats seafood wherever he goes. So I would say eat here as a thing to tick off the list but choose wisely."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","What an amazing, exciting experience",50,19 January 2018,"Friends from Singapore took us here for dinner one evening, WOW are we glad they did. What an exciting, vibrant place to eat. So many choices and variety and all very well priced. Even the beer is cheap. Absolutely a must do when visiting Singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food,40,12 January 2018,"We where there with 5 people enjoying food from different stalls. It's a Asian style environment but still focused on foreign tourist.
The food was super"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Halal seafood available,40,31 December 2017,Thumbs up!! Prices are very reasonable. Be prepared to share tables since always crowded. One downside is when having to sit in between very loud boisterous dinner groups.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good value for a family,40,31 December 2017,"This Centre is a few minutes walk from the Newton MRT station. We found the food fresh, tasty and very good value. We explained that our Coeliac son had to have gluten free food and the lady sourced dishes from a few stalls for him. Cheapest meal we had in Singapore!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",busy but food was disappointing ,20,28 December 2017," i was looking forward to taking my wife to a hawker centre to try some great food including the chilli crab, now it is only a hawker centre but my previous experience in singapore is that they have been very good , I checked this place out on trip adviser and took the MRT to get there. Arrived , all good , busy and a good vibe however the food was not good in fact it was far from good . perhaps we were unlucky with our choice . However i would suggest that unless you have been recommended a place at the centre, really don’t care or happy to just risk it i would think carefully about this centre - there are other choices .If you decide to go i hope that you have a better food experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing food,50,27 December 2017,Dropped in for dinner the other night. Fantastic selection of food to suit most tastes. Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. Soft shell crab was great. Selection of Indian curries was awesome. Dumplings were delicious. Prices were reasonable for both food a drinks. Can be a little overwhelming on arrival as stall holders bid for your business. Recommend a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Street food,50,25 December 2017,"If you want real food, authenticity and local produce without the frills then this is the place. We loved it, went everyday once we discovered it. Please note, it’s cheap and is not at all flash so if you like silver service, this is NOT for you. The food however is fresh and delicious. $10 will get you just about anything and a large beer will set you back $5. Refreshingly affordable and authentic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great night out with the family,40,22 December 2017,"Took the family (some hadn't been here before) for dinner with a difference. The food was as good as it has been in the past, fast service, great selection at very reasonable prices.Not quite as charming as it was years ago but all very neat, tidy and clean.The grand-children enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food. I enjoyed the food and the cold beers!As in the past this will always be a place I visit when in Singapore!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fried oyster omelette,40,17 December 2017,Nice food. Too less variety. Most of the are selling the same food. Fried oyster omelette and Satay from stall 73 and stall 76 meat try.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very average,30,16 December 2017,Tried a few stalls and the food was very mediocre. Had the curried skate wings which were the best of the variety of items we ordered. Certainly not the Singapore hawker food of past. This is OK for a visit if you want to say you tried a hawker center but not a must visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food exhibition ,40,15 December 2017,Newtons hawker center hasn't changed much in the past 20years.. the food quality is very good and there are plenty of options to choose from.. since most of the seating is outdoor / it can be inconvenient when it rains.. will be back some day..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety ,40,5 December 2017,"As this is a hawker center, we ordered different kinds of food to try and share amongst ourselves.We had satay, grilled chicken wings, fishball noodles and reddish cake. The food was delicious and nice to be shared. We washed down our food with Tiger beer, which made our experience very enjoyable.Do sit in the open air section in the middle, as it gets quite stuffy under the shelter."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hectic and delicious!,40,2 December 2017,"This was my second visit, we visited a few years before and I was not ready for all the sprooking which at first put me off. Visiting again and being prepared for all the sprooking this time I enjoyed the experience a lot more. The place is very busy due to popularity, a lot of locals eat here too, not just tourists. There is so much to choose from and the food is absolutely delicious. Have to have some satay and watermelon juice!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Represents S’pore food, culture at great price",50,9 November 2017,"If you are a tourist, expatriate working here or a Sporean, Newton HC is the place to visit for a great night with friends. It had its ugly past from a few black sheeps touting food in the competitive environment but what Spore food you need to try out is here. Not the top in each category, but the variety is good enough. Bad food will self eliminate the stalls anyway... my personal preference- braised duck meat, oyster omelette, rojak, satay, fish ball soup, and of course of the bbq stingrays, crayfish etc. No specifix stalls for mention. Beside Newton MRT station"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Perfect Singapore chilli crab,50,6 November 2017,"Alliance seafood’s Singapore chilli crab is mentioned in the Singapore Michelin guide and as expected it’s faultless. The Sri Lankan crabs are fresh, juicy and tender and the sweet and tangy sauce has the right level of heat. The fried mantou (buns) are the best to soak it up with. They go that little bit extra and provide plastic gloves and napkins. Look for stand 27. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit over hyped,30,2 November 2017,"Went with a local who eats there alot. Mixture of locals and tourists. Large open area with tables. Tables also available along the edges next to the stalls. Try to get a table in the open area as it's less stuffy. Have someone save your table as you browse all the food stalls and then switch. Lots of options, though most offer the same fare. Prices are reasonable but I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the food. Make sure you bring your own tissues/napkins as they are not offered there."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always a good meal,40,31 October 2017,"Newton can be over hypped but there is good food to be found. I am a local and I would eat there.. So enjoy the satay, popiah, malay rice esp the corner stall, thai all good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The best,50,30 October 2017,"Having been warned by a friendly taxi driver to agree prices before we placed the order, we braved a visit here. The result was one of the best meals - Chilli Crab of course. We were lucky to pick The Ocean BBQ ( stall 16) run by a gentleman by the name of Dino Marn. And so glad we did. All up including the taxi it cost us $100 for 2 including drinks. Well worth it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore Chilli Crab,40,14 October 2017,"Newton Hawker Centre was recommended and the Singapore Chilli Crab as the dish you should try. Well the place has a lot of budget meals and eateries, but the hawkers do not relent, you want to look at a menu and prices and they want to sit you down and shove a meal in front of you. Found a place for chilli Crab, most places charge $5 per 100gram of crab weight. Advice is to see Crab and get an estimate of weight and cost before you order, we did about face and paid the price. The meal was very good, did not have to wait long. After our meal we got our bill and to our surprise it was not what we expected. the Crab was nowhere near half a kilo let alone we paid for over a kilo. There is a large selection of meals and they start around $4, select a couple of dishes and you have a good meal. A wide variety Indian, Malay, chinese and Singaporean. Alcohol is also available."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best hawker center,50,12 October 2017,This is the best hawker center on singapore. On advice i went to two other hawker centers and was sadly disappointed. Newton is definitely has the best to offer. Its very clean and has excellent stalls to choose from. Number 31 heng heng bbq has excellent food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cut throat pricing,20,3 October 2017,"For tourists, take my advice, do NOT visit Newton Hawker Centre in Singapore. Because there are mamy tourists visit this centre, the hawker will tend to charge you at a sky-rocket price (especially the seafood stalls) than the local. If you are not aware, they may charge you $100- $120 per king prawn. If you really want to eat here, ask for the final price first before they cook.The taste of food here is of average standard. I personally prefer other hawker centres like Maxwell Hawker Ctr (they serve mainly lunch, no dinner)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great variety, something for all tastes.",40,29 September 2017,"We had one of the best lobster meals ever!!! Black pepper lobster, you get to choose the lobster and pay by the 100g. Excellent food.
There is dozens of food shops with dining tables outside under the fans. So much to choose from."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the BEST places for amazing food in Singapore,50,20 September 2017,"Newton Hawker Centre is a buzzing place with incredible food and a fantastic vibe. We tried so many food options and everything was amazing.....not to mention very affordable in what is an expensive city with cheap food and really good drinks options and prices (hello, $39 for a bucket of 6 coronas). Highly recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable food at reasonable price,30,17 September 2017,"We were jet lagged and needed a simple meal close to our hotel so ended up here. There are other hawker centres that are better, but we were all able to find something we wanted to try and enjoyed what we ate and drank. Place was clean with lots of staff clearing tables etc."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,20,14 September 2017,"Great food but really, what a rip off. Go to Whampoa Hawker once, and this place will feel like you're paying like a Michelin Star restaurant in London. This place is purely for tourists who want to say they've eaten like the Singaporeans do. It's probably 3 x more expensive than it should be. No Singaporeans eat here!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but bad ambience,40,11 September 2017,"Went recently, food was great. Ordered the standard sugar cane juice, sting ray, satay and rojak. All are a must try. Food are reasonably priced.Ambience however was not my favourite. Hot and stuffy, filled with smoke and grease. Some touting, but they leave you to be if you are not interested. Must go if you stay at Sheraton hotel as it is walking distance."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food reasonably priced,40,5 September 2017,"We have eaten here quite a lot. First time we have eaten the Chili Crab, my wife says its great, my satay sticks were a bit fatty but not bad."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Local Sout East Asia street food , all the flavour risk free",50,24 August 2017,"I have been visiting Newton Circuss Hawker center since 30 years ago. Convenient - MRT (Metro) station across the street. A short walk (10 mins) form bussy commercial district of Orchard Road.Dozens of food kiosks and stalls with tasty and delicious local meals prepared on the spot. fast food, NO JUNK food.It can be crowdy... anytime. specially at conventional dinner times. Id that is the case... just be patient and be fast to grab a table. or just look around to make your mind on wtah to eat.. and take out or eat on the go.It is open air. No air Con. it is pàrt of the experience.Hygiene standards high and above average in asian street foof (a big ++ for westerns sensitive guts)The biggest challenge.... to decide what to eat with such temting array os scents and flavours ... and all the owners ""self-promoting"" as the best among the rest. Tough choices,"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Inconsistent ,40,22 August 2017,"The place is always busy, but well organise as its got nice ambiance, clean, safe, friendly mamas & uncles offering you some different cuisine, though a bit pricey, but the price pays all those above. Mostly seafood, local Malaysian or Indonesian, Indian and Thai are available. Just that this time we were a bit disappointed as we ordered few different dish, most of the dish arrived quickly, but the main dish for our children came way too late while the first dish all were almost finish for us adult ... We had to get up twice reminding the stall to get food out. We ll go to another stalls next time ..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent value for money,40,20 August 2017,"When it was too late to go anywhere for dinner, the concierge at our hotel suggested that we go to Newton Hawker Centre for a bite. The place was super crowded even after 11 pm, and everybody there seemed to be enjoying a hearty, and by the looks of it, exotic, meal. We stuck to our favorites, kungpao chicken and fried rice, with pork dumplings on the side. It was quite a satisfying meal, and didn't cost too much too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth visiting,40,10 August 2017,This is a popular Hawker center both among locals and visitors. There are dozens of food stalls selling all kinds of things. Seafood is very popular here. I tried the singapore chilli jumbo crab and Bun and it was fantastic. However the price is not transparent in the sense that the stalls don't show you the weight of the fish or prawn they cook. But worth visiting of course.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Integrity at Alliance Seafood at Newton Hawker Ctr,40,6 August 2017,"Ordered a stingray about 4 weeks ago at this store. Turned out to be tough and dry. Upon telling the store the inedible dish, the store assistant offered me a different dish free of charge. However at that time I had ordered a similar dish from an adjacent store so I declined. To my pleasant surprise, Alliance promptly refunded the dish in FULL. As a local Singapore which had eaten at numerous hawker centers, I had never experienced a full refund, bar none, no matter how bad the food was. Well done Alliance! Am coming back to try your other dishes as I know I will be eating in peace!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and good local food ,50,4 August 2017,My favorite food in Newton food center is BBQ stingray. Portion is pretty big and very cheap! Highly recommend chili crab as well(we chose #27 stand) if you don't wanna spend over S$100 in Jumbo. We had a small size of fried rice and chili crab and it was S$40 nett. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun,40,28 July 2017,Love this hawker centre!! I live near Orchard road and it's the closest. Good food and beer! Prices are very reasonable!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Packed ,40,21 July 2017,"It's definitely a place for food, a lot of repetition food stall, so just follow your guts and choose one stall. Foods are amazing, price slightly above average and is always packed with people. But don't miss it out. Go and sqeat yourself then order something cold to chill down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good cheap tucker!,40,21 July 2017,"Arrived just after 6pm. While the whole place was very busy, we found a table ok. The lady with the shop nearest the table was over in a flash, with photos on a menu board and asking what we would like. It turned out that she organised drinks (from another nearby vendor) and our two meals, which happened to be from a third vendor. Excellent service and very cheap. So good for local street food that we went back a second night and wull most likely go back again before we leave."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place to eat to experience the Culture,40,20 July 2017,"This is the place to go for a group where you can all choose your individual favourites. There are many many small outlets all servicing different cuisines, from Indian, to Indonesian, to Chinese and many more. It is cheap and very good fun. You can choose what you want and then all sit together at the outside tables in the middle and mix and match!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",newton food centre,30,20 July 2017,"Food is fresh and cooked good.

Clean toilets.
Generally its okie."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,40,20 July 2017,"Overwhelming choices of food :-). I am sure each stall has nice food.Especially good was the satay with the peanut sauce. We got them from a stall on the very first row. Open atmosphere, good for evening but might be too hot for a sunny day. Only limited covered places available when raining!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Mud Crab,50,17 July 2017,"What a hilarious experience! I had been told I had to have Chilli Mud Crab whilst in Singapore and one of the Taxi drivers I had (taxis are great and cheap) suggested that this was the place to go. I walked from Pan Pacific Orchard on a pleasant evening and duly ordered. So much food and so much mess eating it but it was delicious. Stall holders took great delight in telling to ""not be neat and use your hands"" and provided me with many additional napkins to help with the clean-up. there were dozens of stall selling an wide variety of food from the very cheap chicken rice through to the mud crabs which was a once in a visit experience. Definitely worth going to. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Dinner,50,12 July 2017,"Too many choice, for stringray grill the best is stall no 61.
Special singapore food is popiah, carrot cake.
Newtoon Hawker Centre is good for hunting food.
Nice food place on Singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience,40,4 July 2017,"Must try hawker food in Singapore. Humble atmosphere, good food (ordered chili crab with mantau, garlic prawns, grilled stingray, etc), all delicious. But a bit more expensive than expected."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood hawker buzz and more,40,2 July 2017,"Lots of choices mainly seafood prepared dozens of ways, with other usual hawker delights - satay, curries, kway teow, mee goreng, poh piah, duck noodle, oyster omelete and so much more. Reasonably priced given its a hawker center. Aside from the usual drink vendors, there's interesting beer on tap stall inside the triangle farthest from the two entry points. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hot food cold beer,40,25 June 2017,"Always a great place to visit with friends for tasty food accompanied by jugs of ice cold tiger beer. Cheap, cheerful and tasty .. recommend giving it a go..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at amazing price,50,17 June 2017,"I genuinely think Newton Hawker Center is better than Lau pa Sat. Environment is better and the sellers aren't as pushy as the ones in Lau pa Sat! And it closes at 2am on weekends I believe! If you are going on Friday evening then consider go a bit early like 6-7ish so you can grab seats for you and friends or family, before eveyone else starts to show up. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummmm,50,12 June 2017,Such an enjoyable dining experience in Singapore. Something different than the overpriced and boring food found in the shopping areas.I've heard that tourists get a different price to locals. But the price is so good that it didn't worry us.And they have beer towers!! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton food center,50,12 June 2017,"I was brought here by a family member when i visited Singapore back in April. By the time i visited this one, we already ate at a few other food centers. I think after Lau Pa Sat this was my favorite of them. I let the host order most of the food so im not exactly sure where the food we had ordered came from but it was all so good. We came for dinner and the place was quite crowded but we were able to get a table under the overhang. We were looking for a table out in the open but they were all taken already. Noteable foods we had here, roast duck, char kway kway, baby gai lan, oyster omelette. I enjoyed everything here and thinking about the food is making my mouth water."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Want a taste of Singapore?,40,11 June 2017,"This famous food centre has been around for many years but it is still able to retain its popularity with locals and tourists. There is a good variety of food , most of which are typically Singapore. Local food like satay, oyster omelet , several kinds of noodles ( wanton/roast pork, fishball, minced pork etc), seafood (famous chilli crab, stingray etc) was of a high standard . For thirst-quenching drinks the variety was also good , such as fresh sugar cane juice, fruit juices , local Tiger beer etc. The centre is easily accessible by public transport and is on the Newton MRT stop . The place consists of a covered part next to the stalls and a big middle uncovered part. If it rains , this can be a problem . All in all a very good place to savour the culinary delights of street ( and other ) foods of Singapore. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always great satay,40,8 June 2017,"The satay has always been good at Newton over the many years I have been visiting Singapore. It's the reason I visit Newton. It's still as good as always, and we also really enjoyed the fried rice. Great atmosphere and plenty of choice - a must when visiting Singapore. I've only taken off one point because it's not that cheap anymore and the touting can be a bit annoying, although that has improved greatly over the years."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for drinks and supper,50,6 June 2017,"Stall 29 offered nice cold drinks and super chilled beers. Linda never fails to make you feel welcomed and homely. Great fresh seafood offered at other stalls, when the time of your visit is right."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Crab heaven ,40,6 June 2017,"Great atmosphere and endless selection of cuisines . Easy to get to. Full of locals
A bit more expensive than expected"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local food centre,40,5 June 2017,"Still a place for tourists. Mostly seafood stalls. Quite difficult to find place to sit unless you order food from that particular stall, the stall people will help you find a place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What Do You Want Top Eat?,50,28 May 2017,"Wow. You can find anything you want to eat at the Newton Hawker Centre which is also a favorite with the locals for authentic local food. There are so many places to choose from and each one specializes in a different type of food.You just sit down anywhere there is room so be aware that you might be sharing your table with someone else but this is a great way to talk with other people. Each table has a number on it' so when you have walked around to see what you want to eat, you place your order and give them your table number and they will bring you your food.I started with some very cold beer because of the heat and then went on to some delicious stay sticks with a very nutty sauce which I loved. I then had fresh prawns with garlic butter and they were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.The Newton Hawker Centre is right beside the Newton MRT station so it very easy to get there and a two minute walk across the walkway to get there from the station.While you are there you can try some Durian fruit; often called the smelliest fruit in the world. It tastes quite nice but you do have to get past the smell.One tip: I found that the undercover area beside the cooking stalls was quite hot even though there are ceiling fans so I shifted to the open area in the middle of the center of the area which was much cooler."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic Hawker centre with so much to choose from.,50,24 May 2017,You can't come to Singapore without trying the authentic Hawker centre where so many locals eat. The choice of food and freshness is amazing and unbelievably cheap for the amount and quality. Girly recommend this place. Loved it!!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fish Singaporean Style,40,24 May 2017,"Atmosphere great, buzzing with happy eaters. The food offered is predominately seafood but good and varied. A little pricey."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but not 'hawker prices',40,20 May 2017,"Given it's located close to the hotel-rich area of Orchard road, the Newton Hawker centre is one of the most famous and well tourist-ed of the hawker centers of Singapore. It is a large open air dining area with basic seats and tables. There are certainly plenty of food options but the prices are significantly higher than what you would expect for a hawker center. Vendors will approach you in an attempt to sell their wares - although unlike other SE asian hawkers, they were honest and open about the product and price. As a rough guide - small chilli crabs are about 35SD, Beers 7SD (for 667ml Tiger), Small squid entrees about 12SD. There is a number of juices and sugar cane options available.Overall this was a good option in terms of food variety, taste and quality but it wasn't cheap for the standard of dining."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The Popular Newton Hawker Centre!,50,19 May 2017,"This centre serves lots of the Singapore local authentic food and they are not too expensive. Most tables are in the open space and they are always filled with the locals. I went there twice with my family to eat and ordered many dishes to share. Try their satay, fish soup, cockles, gong gong, Singapore laksa and otah! They are also famous for their chillie stingray and ask for the meaty piece so you don't get too many bones! Singapore being such a humid country, I never failed to order my favourite thirst quenching sugar cane juice straight from the presser! Love it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good range of dishes,50,17 May 2017,"Having driven past this hawker centre literally for decades, I decided to make it my mission to visit. It was quite late in the evening, but the place was still jumping. I decided on noodles and a beer. Both were very pleasant. I will definitely be back to try more of the interesting cuisine on offer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",My favourite hawker centre in Singapore!,50,15 May 2017,"Whether you want a fresh green coconut, sugar cane drink or some chilli crab this is the place to come!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of hawker food,50,29 April 2017,"Went here based on concierge recommendation. Short taxi from Orchard Road. Amazing selection of hawker street food in a large, clean and vibrant area. The place was packed on a Friday night and we waited a while for a seat. You order and give them your table number and they bring the dishes to you. Hd amazing satays from RB Express Satay (not cheap though at 70 cents SGD per satay); great prawn dumplings; beer; oyster omelette etc. Delicious! We went by taxi and left by Uber - both really easy as they can drive almost to the door. Highly recommended!"

The rest of the market was a great atmosphere too"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Undercooked Satay,30,20 April 2017,"Went for a dinner in this newly renovated hawker center in Newton. My colleague and I, ordered different dishes in one of the sea food . He ordered also satay in one of the Halal Satay stall. But lo and behold, the satay taste was disgusting. Its undercooked and taste like a raw mutton and chicken too. I spit out some of the portion and did not bother to touch others. I believe this is the worst satay i ever taste. Other dishes like the chilli crab were okay, but the bun they gave also not fully baked. I was so disappointed coming back here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",a lot of food choice,40,18 April 2017,"if you don't know where to eat or what to eat. just try to go to this hawker centre. you can take mrt and alight at newton station take exit b. there was a lot of food to choice. seafood, laksa, mee, oyster, beer and etc. if you craving for seafood i thought that this place is cheaper than many restaurant. and the food was delicious. and don't forget to find your sit first, remember your seat number. order your food and mention your seat number."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere and cheap beer,30,13 April 2017,It is always packed whenever we go there. It is hit and miss with the stalls - we normally find an Indian stall and it is usually pretty good. Watch out for the rip offs but it is one of the iconic places in Singapore.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore,40,12 April 2017,"Although designed as a tourist attraction as well as a residential / office worker hawker centre it is certainly worth an evening of any Singapore visitor's itinerary. Yes, it is more expensive than pretty much any other hawker centre in the city, but it is still cheap for what you get: Usually very good, quick food across multiple cuisines: Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Thai, Indian, with lots of fruit and juice (and beer) stalls. It is always lively with a good locals/tourist mix."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A lot of fun!!!,40,10 April 2017,"Great vibe and good food, this is worth the trip even if it was just for the experience. Don't worry about night time travel, it is safe and family friendly. Try everything if you like we had 3 different dishes from 3 different vendors and all were tasty and quickly delivered."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Taste Street Food Here for under SD$10,40,5 April 2017,"This was recommended by our waiter at the cafe in the botanical gardens. It is easy to get to from the MRT line and it has fantastic options for local cuisines. The outlets are graded from A-D for their health code practices. Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on. Cleaners bus these way to be washed and distributed back to the vendors but it is not looked favorably on if you just leave them on the table. Its a good system really.Smoke only in designated smoking sites.Try as much unusual foods as you can or taste your favorites done authentically Singaporean style ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced for what it is,30,4 April 2017,We hit many hawker centres across the city and this one was by far the most expensive.Our taxi driver had warned us they have had issues with ripping customers off here - I can see why. The beers and water were significantly pricier than elsewhere.The food was good but not the best we had in Singapore. It was full of locals but actually seemed the least authentic of the dozen hawker markets we visited. I say this because it was the only one that had true hawkers trying to sell us their wares. This is what made it feel as though it was staged for those looking for this experience.It seemed to mainly cater for seafood which is all well and good but for me variety truly is the spice of life. There is nowhere near the choice of the likes of Amoy Street.We ate at Alliance Seafood (in the Michelin Guide) which I cannot deny was very nice - the prawns were very tasty indeed. Shame we left Newton wishing for more.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grill Sting Ray,40,3 April 2017,"Fantastic and delicious Grill Sting Ray and Black Pepper Beef.
There are many other seafood.. Also, try to Vegetarian Rojak as it taste quite different from the black sauce."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Kul,40,2 April 2017,"Amazing Chilli Crab ;)
You can enjoy your meals here with many asian food and drinking and many tables inside.
Hawker Center with cars park and near MRT station."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The real deal,40,29 March 2017,"The real deal, as it has been for decades. Close to the city, and Newton MRT. Busy with locals and expats. What impressed me was the freshness and quality of the seafood at a range of outlets -lobster, bugs(sometimes labelled as crayfish, sometimes as lobster-we know them as Balmain Bugs), stingray, tiger prawns. Adam Liaw recommended Stall 27, and the stingray with sambal didn't disappoint. Especially with a cold bottle of Tiger."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Family Dinner,40,29 March 2017,Wow love the different options availabe to you at Newton Circua hawker food center. Anything from Mee Goreng to Chicken Satay to Teh Tarik . Food comes fast and cheap. Would recommend coming just to try all the different dishes.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience not to be missed,40,23 March 2017,A wonderful experience with something like 50 or 60 different food outlets to choose from surrounding a central seating area. Incredibly busy when we were there at 9:00pm but well organised and remarkably clean with a great atmosphere.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Highly recommended,50,21 March 2017,"Highly recommended for a visit to Singapore. Excellent food, reasonably priced, and great atmosphere. Great experience of open air eating."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Open Air food centre in the city,40,20 March 2017,"Convenient location in the city, good public facilities and well maintained.Great place to eat or try Singaporean dishes and a wide variety of seafood. Western food is also availableThe prices are clearly stated on the menu/board. However it's good to double check before ordering the dishes.Come early to get good seats."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food,50,19 March 2017,"Great, clean hawker center that is easily accessible via the MRT. Great food, a little pricier than some other centers. I'd say this one is one more tourists go to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great place to taste local food ,50,14 March 2017,"This is a must-visit hawker center in Singapore. It's relatively cleaner than many other non-air conditioned hawker centers I have visited. To name a few, my favourites are the salad wrap facing carpark, fishballs/fish dumplings from the left (inside) corner stall and satays from Heng 興.There are many stalls selling BBQ seafood too, but be very careful when ordering crab, fish, lobsters and prawns/shrimps because these are usually charged by weight. It's recommended to find out the costs before ordering.By the way, most food here are served in disposable cutlery and utensils."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",All Newton Centre stall owners are much too pushy,10,13 March 2017,Very disappointed because stall owners kept pushing menus in our faces. I will never visit this hawker centre again
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touristy. Overpriced ,30,12 March 2017,The food is average. Prices are crazy high compared to other hawker centres. Nestled in the middle of expat hamlets and orchard road - it's a convenient hawker centre. Food is acceptable - similar to Lao pasat. Staff are not friendly.If you can I suggest chomp chomp or Adams road. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at cheap prices,50,2 March 2017,Great food at cheap prices. definitely worth the far walk from either MRT Stations (its sort of in between 2 stations)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Memory lane visit,30,25 February 2017,Memory lane visit - still very popular - and has a wide range of food. Tidied up since old days. Worth a visit for the feeling.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still good,40,21 February 2017,"Red many reports about Newton but glad to say it still serves fresh good food.
Prices has gone up but Its still cheap to get good here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus has had its Day....Long ago!!,20,13 February 2017,"Visited Singapore in January 2017 and stayed at an AirBnB accommodation in Novena. Newton Circus Hawker market was about a 10-15min walk away and in the evening was a pleasant walk.On arrival at Newton Circus as you walk in there are signs which state ""No Touting"". From the minute we walked past that sign we were constantly harassed until we found somewhere to sit. The variety of food is not to bad but predominantly seafood but beef, chicken and pork are available if you look around. It is imperative that you confirm prices as they can suddenly change for an unsuspecting tourist. The Indian food was to die for but the rest was fairly plain and nondescript but the kids seem to like it and it was easy.The overall feel of Newton Circus was that it had had its heyday and it looked and felt old and well past its use by date and is need of a clean both in stalls and atmosphere. having spent 9 nights in Singapore we ate here twice and the second time was due to necessity and not by choice due to a long day at Legoland and the train stopped at this location. We ate at far better places including La Pau Sat and China Town."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good hawker food stalls,40,19 January 2017,"A quality hawker centre with plenty of variety that is close to Orchard Rd. You can get into a queue with the locals or find something yourself. Plenty of seating with fans and stalls with cold drinks and beer. Dishes with duck, chicken rice, Indian, satay's etc available. All priced around $4-5 SGD. Great value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Makan time!!!,50,18 January 2017,"Oh my oh my ! its been almost a decade since I gone to Newton Hawker Center. Now its new , clean and spacious. Prices use to be extremely steep with stalls cheating out prices but not anymore . Price are pretty standard then outside hawker stalls no just expect slightly bit more. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy cheap food!,50,17 January 2017,Best place for a famous hawker market meal in Singapore - its clean and comfortable and the food is of an excellent quality for the standard - you will not be disappointed and will leave full and happy!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing food variety,50,16 January 2017,A short distance walk from our hotel at Grand Hyatt. Wide variety of food to choose for and still very reasonable price with the new government tightening the pricing to attract tourists. I would recommend here if you want to try variety of Singaporean food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Seafood,40,13 January 2017,"Visited for dinner one night after a recommendation from the hotel. Glad we went. There are a lot of vendors to choose from and a good choice of food.It is mainly seafood, but there are noodle dishes and chicken on offer. Have to recommend the grilled prawns, chilli crab, followed by an ice cold tiger.It isn't the cheapest food on offer in Singapore, but some of the freshest."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Easy to reach, good food, a bit pricey",40,12 January 2017,"We always come to newton Circus hawker to find Halal Chilli Crab. The official halal sign appears in the particular sea food stalls. Mostly delicious, You must try Chilli Crab, Grilled Stingray and Fired Mantou"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Different experience,30,12 January 2017,"Well we decided that we would go and have some dinner at the Newton centre. I had been there 30 years ago it would be similar, then it was very much like to the seafood marking where we could choose our own food and They would cook it in front of you. However it is quite different now and the selections are very similar across the board. It was hot and could not find a table so we left. It was quite cheap however."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a let down,20,8 January 2017,This place is way more expensive then the maxwell road hawker centre but it does have alot of seafood dishes. We went on a Sunday for lunch and only about 1/4 of the places were open. Head to maxwell toad hawker centre for better food and cheaper prices. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun place to try local dishes,40,2 January 2017,"Newton Hawker Centre is just a short walk from the Sheraton Towers. Be aware, however, that it will require a small hike up a long flight of stairs to get up to the overpass to cross Bukit Timah Road. The food selection is good and very inexpensive. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit this Hawker Centre as there are many in Singapore, but if in the area, I would definitely recommend it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ask for Alvin at Alliance seafood no 27,50,31 December 2016,"Went with son and our wives. He is a regular and made straight for Alliance Seafood number 27 and Alvin. They are in the Michelin Guide. We shared a variety of platters and I liked them all, but especially the calamari. This is alfresco eating and the centre is full of locals. So it should have been good and certainly was."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive tourist trap,20,30 December 2016,"Food quality is really quite poor : stingray was old & smelly , sambal was straight out of a bottle ; vegetables were old & woody ; satay was mediocre etc etc Very very expensive Far better places to eat in Singapore than this tourist trap"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great experience.,40,28 December 2016,"We were staying in the centre of Singapore and found it very easy to use the public transport and go further afield. We took the tube to Newton Circus, which was cheap and the trains ran regularly. The actual food market has outside seating for diners and the idea is you choose from the menus of any of the food venues. We got rice from one, drinks from another and the main meal from a third... It's a kind of mix and match and each venue gives you a bill for what you had from their menu. Overall, it was a cheap night out and we enjoyed the food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Hawker Center I've Visited,40,10 December 2016,"Overall, I liked this Hawker Center the best of the 3 that I have visited. it's not the biggest, but it is clean, easy to get to (very close to subway stop), and they have a very good variety of food and drinks. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the other hawker centers selling oyster omelettes...but they had them here...and it was delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best oyster omelette Hup Kee stall 73,40,3 December 2016,"One of the best oyster omelette in Singapore. Still the best to date. We have been eating from this Aunty for more than 10 years. Her oyster omelette is always fried to the right colour, nicely browned, and not too oily. The oysters... Always big and very fresh. A must try when you are at newton hawker. Also generous with her garnishing of coriander and spring onion. A must-eat when there!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",You must visit and have a meal at Newtons,50,25 November 2016,"This the original street food presented in a safe clean environment . Grab a table and choose from the 100's of different places , lots of cold beer on Ice . Take a seat and they come to you , if they have not got it ask ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must go. Food heaven of Singapore ,50,22 November 2016,"Local food at it's best at very fair price also closest to city center. All best grill seafood counter 39 is awesome, go order from the famous lady bee hive (big hair lady) she's super nice."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent hawker centre,40,16 November 2016,Very busy but excellent food. Good prices and typical Singapore atmosphere. A little touristy but frequented by a lot of locals.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus is as good as ever ...,50,15 November 2016,"This was my fifth visit to Singapore and I couldn't not go to Newton Circus. I first went there in 1980: it was amazing then and, I was now delighted to see, it still is amazing ...So many stalls are so very good: there are several good satay stalls (actually they're all good!) while the seafood - particularly the tiger prawns - is wonderful. We especially liked the food from Stall 49 (curiously named 'Denmark Seafood') who seemed to have a symbiotic relationship with Stall 48 ('Sim Huat') who kept us plied with those large bottles of Tiger Beer.At the end of that particular evening these good people bade us goodbye - shaking hands with us - with a cheerful ""see you again"". They will: we will be back!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",New experience,50,12 November 2016,When I asked taxi driver to take me to hawker centre he wanted to know if it was the right address ? It a culture shock initially from beautiful restaurants to London wooden tables and benches and not many foreigners there ! You go from stall to stall seeing all this freshly cooked food and deciding what to have .I had chicken satay yo die for special flavoured rice and crab to die for .No wonder this is where the locals eat best meal I have had since arriving in Singapore and such good value for money a definite must when visiting Singapore .
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's an institution 😊,30,10 November 2016,"Newton Hawker Centre has become a must visit on the tourist check list. I've been visiting for the past 35 years. The food is varied and affordable. But like most street food it's invariably acceptable quality. The centre is open well past midnight so it's a popular late night option. Local favourites include oyster omelet, sate, chicken rice and a wide variety of sea food.It's prudent to check what the ordered items will cost while ordering "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pretty decent hawker food close to Orchard,40,9 November 2016,"Nice little centre, focused mostly on seafood. Black Pepper crab is delicious. Also have beer towers icy cold."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood,50,2 November 2016,"Delicious and such good service... and friendly, food fresh and piping hot! Good selection and lovely atmosphere, also the lady who looks after the drinks, awesome"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome Black Pepper Crab,50,1 November 2016,Lovely outdoor dining atmosphere With ample parking space. We had Black Pepper crab with seafood Fried Rice and we loved every bit of it. I tried the sugar cane juice and ended up having 2 glasses. The place was crowded but the service was prompt & very courteous
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A tourist trap,20,31 October 2016,Disappointing experience. This hawker centre is not what it used to be. It now caters to tourists looking for sea food. Most stalls sell sea food...which also means there's a big competition amongst hawkers and you can feel quite intimidated by them trying to make a sale. There are much better places to eat in Singapore. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap,20,31 October 2016,"I guess it would be correct to say, one gets what one is paying for. Still I think in Singapore, One can get a more satisfying meal for the same budget elsewhere. I was surprised to see many locals here too but I won't be back."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tasty food, reasonable price",40,27 October 2016,"A big improvement on the old hawker centre I remember from years ago. All paved, clean, wash basins provided, and the food was good. Not cheap by street food standards but reasonably priced and a ""small"" serve was still plenty for one or as part of a number of share plates for two. Not overly hassled by vendors to take their menus. Selected from a variety of stalls. Service was quick. All the food was tasty. Mainly seafood but other meat choices available. Went on a friday night and no problems to get a table before 7pm but then was very busy after that. Better signage once you come out of the exit at Newton MRT would be useful (follow the path sharp left out of station exit)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and should be,30,24 October 2016,"This is a cheap eat, and it should be. The quality ordinary. The shellfish I had and on previous occasions looks great but lacks flavour, I suspect all farmed and I don't dare ask where (or how). I enjoy watching the life at this place and how the stall owners work. A different view of the world."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",old favourite freshened up but didn't dissapoint,50,23 October 2016,"still stunning array of delicacies to sample and get a good cross section of the best cuisine in the country. well priced, handy vendors who find a seat and a cold beer for you...love the whole thing. satays and chilli crab the best pics."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good and plenty of food choices, nowadays also easier to get a table",40,23 October 2016,"Newton Hawker Centre is/was always popular with foreigners ,tourist and expat alike, which live nearby or in CBD area. This explains also why its more expansive compare to other Hawker centres. Food quality and choice is good and tasty and nowadays you get a table faster then before."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good old Newton Hawker Centre ,40,19 October 2016,"I grew up with Newton. This was our fave food place after a night out in town during the 1990s. The current revamped hawker street food is more organized and cleanliness has improved tremendously. Some all time fave food would include prawn noodle soup, oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, BBQ stingray in sambal chilli sauce and hokkien fried prawn noodles. There is a Chinese dessert stall in the left hand row as you enter via the car park. They have one of the best Chinese dessert selection at good value prices. Dining here this evening certainly brought back many memories"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place!!,50,18 October 2016,"The food is amazing. Lots of fun and the food is great. Lots of stalls. Try lots of things. The stingray is good, but be sure to scrape it sideways instead of trying to cut into it to avoid the bones. Great food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and yummy,50,17 October 2016,"I've searched this hawker food here in TripAdvisor and satisfied with the reviews so I decided to have a visit. The place was so clean and they offer lots of food variety, name it and I'm sure they have it here. From noodles to rice chicken and duck. I'm telling you this is a must try if you are visiting Singapore try hawker food it's cheap like 5 to 10 SGD only for a complete heavy set of meal with a nice shakes! You're missing something in Singapore if you don't try this one "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy hawker food,50,13 October 2016,"Not too far from Orchard rd, 5 minutes by taxi or 20 minute walk from Far east plaza. to a yummy outdoor food court. Great service as you grab a table which is numbered, order your food and drink and they bring to your table freshly cooked. Satays, calamari and chicken wings were yummy. The satays so delicious that we ordered another batch of 50 amongst a family of 5. Relaxing outdoor setting on a balmy night eating Satays and drinking ling neck Tiger beers and the kids drinking freshly squeezed juices was sensational and very reasonably priced."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A good place to go,30,12 October 2016,Always a decent food court. Never disappointed and the food is always acceptable. The chili crab is 1/3 the price of Jumbo Restaurant and I think it tastes much better when eaten with fried ManTo.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another great Hawkers food market in Singapore. ,50,9 October 2016,"This hawkers market has recently been given a make over. Lovely clean tables and seats with plent of room for all. So many choices that it gets hard to decide what and where to eat. The food is fresh, flavorful and cheap. Order you meals from the hawkers and they deliver your selections to your table and then you pay them. Cash only trade here. Watch out for the man selling tissues, as the hawkers don't have napkins. A must to visit in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit!,40,8 October 2016,I love the diverse food you can get here! The stall holders are all very knowledgable and are very accommodating. You must give this a go when you are in Singapore.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still good!,40,4 October 2016,"After our last visit over 20 years ago, the place had changed, but the food was equally good.
Reasonable prices for local dishes.
Worth a visit."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",First time. Wow. Busy and freshly cooked food,50,4 October 2016,Only 50 metres away from the newton train station. All cash but there are atm there. So much to choice from. Cooked while you wait and very cheap local food. Loved it and will return again.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still th same after al these years,40,4 October 2016,This has got to be one of the best places to visit to experience the broad range of foods groups and styles typical to Singapore and the Asian region. Open all night it is also a great place for supper after a few drinks with friends. They used to have the biggest chicken wings I had ever seen but not anymoreThis time it was oyster omelet and mutton soup on the way home. So much choice there is something for everybody
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lively and good food,40,23 September 2016,"If you like your food al fresco with about a thousand others, both locals and tourists, this is your go to place. Newton has become our first checkpoint whenever we travel to Singapore.Endorsed by the Singaporean Tourism promotion board you get a first profile of local cuisine at 83 food stalls. Not all of them are different though. Among locals Newton has gained notoriety as some stalls were overcharging for their seafood. So better check prices and make sure you don't receive something you did not order. We however did not encounter any problems. Stall owners were friendly, food arrived fast and we got what we ordered. We enjoyed yummy fish ball kway tiao, excellent chicken wings and tasty kalian. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood nice,50,20 September 2016,"Food nice and good price newton in the best place to eat and hangout .
Ive been staying here a year and always going out with friends to have dinner here . Stingray and calamary is good"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food and atmosphere,50,14 September 2016,"Friendly stall holders, wonderful food! Prices are very good, service is excellent. Drinks are at reasonable prices. Table service is fast and efficient. If they don't have what you want, they will find a stall that does!! Best hawker we have been to"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for a quick cheap eat,30,13 September 2016,There is plenty of choice and the food seems fresh. Its very tasty and everyone is catered for. Definitely worth a visit for a cheap eat.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,40,12 September 2016,"A place which you can try most of the local food in one place.We usually visit this place once a month. And the usual stalls that we will visit is 'Hai Yan Seafood' and the fried oyster egg stall which the auntie has a bit of attitude problem. :p But the fried oyster egg is really yummy.The staff at 'Hai Yan' is super friendly. The stall is facing the main car park of Newton Circus. The service is good, price is reasonable and the food is yummy. We always order the sambai stingray and clams. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist-trap food centre,30,8 September 2016,"Newton Hawker Centre was my least favourite of the 6 food centres we visited during our recent 4-day holiday to Singapore.It was hot and very busy on the Friday night we were there....the aromas of cooking food filled the air.There was nothing wrong with the food we received....in fact it was quiet impressive. BBQ stingray....black pepper crab and satay.......all were delicious. Prices were reasonable....but not as cheap as other centres.I think it was the atmosphere here that was the biggest let down for me.....all the stall holders are out the front of their stalls touting. It was the least ""authentic"" of all the food centres we visited. As a tourist......don't let this be your only food centre experience in Singapore.....there are so many better options for you to try!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great introduction - tourist-friendly enough but also authentic - a good mix,50,2 September 2016,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. A great mix of options and a good intro to Hawker Centres. It's clean enough without being too sanitised - bustling and (important bit) the food options are good. Also, drinks are a lot cheaper than in hotels so have a few beers while you're there. Note: Hawker Centres are not great for vegetarians at all - very few dishes that are all vegetable even, and I suspect even those ones may be cooked using some seafood-based sauces and / or in pans that are also used for meat/poultry/seafood."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good to visit food center,40,24 August 2016,"Crowded mostly by locals, not centrally located but worth a visit.
Big variety of local food, other asian countries cuisines also available.
Satay, chicken rice, carrot cake and all traditional singapore dishes are available here.
Good prices and nice place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Expensive, touristy and hot!",30,21 August 2016,"It's one of the obligatory stops when bringing tourists around Singapore. This one is just off the Newton MRT stop (one away from Orchard) and is almost always packed - not with locals but with tourists. Yes, the cereal prawns are tasty, the satay tender and salted egg crab really yummy but if one would cost SG$60++, then I will have to refrain from coming back. If you find yourself here, best to look for a table ans order from any of the establishments circling the center. The ""uncles"" would gladly cook your orders and deliver them to your table. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not what it used to be,30,20 August 2016,"Went to Newton Hawker Centre for dinner. This place used to have a wide variety of very decent food at reasonable prices but now seems to be predominantly seafood stalls, drinks stalls and one or two others. Some of the traders persistently tout their stalls despite the rules against this, and others can be quite aggressive about pushing you towards their stalls. The food is pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. We had some decent satay, but the drinks (fruit juices) were watered down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Bog-standard, overpriced, not authentic, unhygienic",10,20 August 2016,"Any shopping mall food court offers better value than this dump! Despite being heavily promoted by the STB, this crummy food centre is not truly representative of SG food. Even Lau Pa Sat is better than this."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit,40,30 July 2016,"Many, many years ago, the hawker centre was at the Orchard Road in front of Cold Storage supermarkets. It still has a similar vibe. Chinese, Malay, seafood.... Clean and true food. A definite must visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chaos in the crowds,30,30 July 2016,"We recently revisited this hawker centre on a trip to Singapore. Granted it was a Friday night but boy were we shocked with the crowds. We could not find a seat anywhere and spent twenty minutes looking for two seats. Once you find your seat, you can proceed to order your food. We had satay and I had to have the spicy stingray. My husband had nasi goring and it was all fine. I have to say the place was super busy and we waited longer than usual for our food. It was definitely an experience and was good to eat at this long standing Singaporean institution. I would recommend not going on a Friday night unless you are in early as it was crazy! It's also very cheap and I would also suggest pinning the seafood stalls down to a price before ordering. Some of them don't have menus with prices on them and I think this is a bit risky customers. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Late night supper & drinks,30,28 July 2016,"You may find this place cheap and value for money while gathering with friends. I usually have beers with friends after work here. However, for seafood lover, remember to ensure the prices before you ordering. Some seafood stalls will charge foreigner higher prices. They open till late night so it's a great place after late work. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow what a winner,40,26 July 2016,This was not the cheapest hawker centre we encountered but it was a winner. All the dishes we tried were great. We will be back!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pretty good,30,24 July 2016,"There are many many different stalls here. Hence, the quality varies. When you get a table, stalls selling seafood will pass you their menus. Ignore if you are not interested. Choose what food you would like and remember to give the stall your table number. Some of the food is top quality stuff, so choose wisely! Furthermore, the food centre looks much better after the recent renovation."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a tourist trap,30,23 July 2016,"At first glance, it's a nice place to get a variety of local fares in one location, with nice open air seating. But it's a bit of a tourist trap, with some of the food being too expensive for local standards. I do have some friends who come from overseas and hear from word of mouth to come here, but for the same variety of food, I'd prob take them somewhere else to get cheaper food, such as Chomp Chomp or even East Coast. But if you do choose to eat there, some of the local delicacies to order include: BBQ Sambal Stingray, BBQ Chicken Wings, Hokkien Mee, Carrot Cake and sugarcane to wash it down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy,50,21 July 2016,Go to Mike with red hair... Delicious... Cannot recommend highly enough.. Chilli crab so good and a very good price!! Kids here on holiday and couldn't wait to go back.. Also stall next the lady who sells drinks so so nice
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience,50,11 July 2016,What a selection - food in Singapore is very safe to eat as very strict guidelines apply. Great selection of food in Hawkers markets. Find a table and note the number on table. Order and pay for food from the many different little food stalls providing table number - When food or drinks are ready stall worker brings to table.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an open air place to dine local fare,30,9 July 2016,"took a few Aussies for dinner to sample the array of local and regional fare available.
A bit of a disappointment unfortunately."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quintessential Singapore Chilli Crab at 31 Heng Heng BBQ,50,7 July 2016,"Took the train to Newton station to have chilli crab on our last day, had to be done. Getting of the train you come out by a roundabout in a nothing looking part of town. Thanks to Google maps for showing the way as it looked like there was nothing there. After locating the area, a triangle of seating and small cooking shacks we went around to view the variety on display. We decided on 31 Heng Heng BBQ. The place was spotlessly clean and the crabs were top quality, heavy and fresh. We ordered a $38 crab and some fried rice. What can I say but it was the best crab I have had, so much meat it easily fed two of us. The sauce was medium hot but you could go either way by request. Highly Recommended."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Less than expected,20,4 July 2016,"When I first came to Singapore I visited many Hawker centres, then I visited Newton to see what the hype was about. Sadly, I was met with pushy vendors, expensive prices, disposable plates, small serves compared to the many other ""non-tourist"" hawker centres. Get a bus further up Bukit Timah Rd to Adam road and try the hawker there - it's so much better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique hawker center,50,1 July 2016,"OK, it is influenced by tourist, but still authentic enough to be recommended especially noting the location. It is a 15 Minute walk from Orchard corner Scotts. Too bad that no authentic Laksa place remained after the recent Renovation. Washrooms much better now."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A huge grouping of local eateries,30,28 June 2016,"You can get many things to eat of a Malay-Chinese nature. Just go around and choose what you want, they'll bring it to your table. The quality is not the best but it is authentic and colourful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","No longer cheap, but better than ever.",40,28 June 2016,"The Newton Circus of old, and what exists now. are world's apart. The food hasn't changed much (it was always worth having), but the physical setting has, and it is much for the better. It is brighter, cleaner, and amazingly efficient. But beware, the seafood dishes can be very expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great chilli crab at newton,40,27 June 2016,"I was recommended this venue by a friend who lived here for 10 years, as an alternative to the east coast seafood market, as it was raining when I visited. This indeed is a really cool place for chilli or pepper crab, and an array of other Asian foods.A big tip to remember here is to ask the stall seller to weigh your food first before ordering, as prices vary greatly.Worth a visit, and easy access by taxi and MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and good place for food!,40,23 June 2016,"I was looking to try some local delicacies when my hotel concierge advised to visit Newton Hawker street. For my 6 day Singapore visit, I visited this place twice for dinner. The only catch is to wear loose and light clothes as this place is open and was pretty humid outside. Overall must visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",I'm a Hater. But stop harassing me for overpriced food,10,19 June 2016,"This is good for tourists. It appears cheap. You can get good quality meals for $10-$15. I've been here 3 times now. I'm over it. The food is just like most other hawkers but it's more expensive for all food and drinks at this place. And the hawker people heckle you to buy. I hate being heckled or having menus shoved in my face or someone saying ""my food is good for your tummy, boss"". If you want good seafood without restaurant prices like Jumbo, then go here. If you're a tourist, this is a good first experience to hawkers. Otherwise, I would never tell someone to go here. I hate this place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This was okay,30,16 June 2016,"I came here probably an hour or so after the lunch rush, so not many people were around and about two thirds of the stalls were closed. I definitely wouldn't characterize this as ""cheap street food""; the prices were comparable to restaurants with similar fare. I had some kind of noodley stir fry thing from a place that claimed to have ""Famous Muslim Food"". It was tasty. This is very convenient to get to by MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere,40,2 June 2016,"We went one evening just for a drink as we could walk from our hotel , it was late on a Saturday night and still very busy . It looked very clean and lots of wash basins around the edge to be able to wash your hands after messy food like chilli crab . We went back on Monday and it was still surprisingly busy . It was good food but not much for a vegetarian . It is priced reasonably and a family of three sat at our table as it is free seating and chatted to us . It is well worth a visit ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food !!!,50,28 May 2016,"On the way to the center of the city, Newton Hawker Centre has a variety of options. I heard about it many times. However after living in Singapore for almost 4 years, we accidentally landed there. It has been an awesome experience of seafood - pepper crab, cereal prawn, kai lang in oyster sauce, chicken fried rice - all MUST try @Heng Heng BBQ-(31) - thanks for making our first trip a memorable one - we will definitely be back soon Kishaloya - Singapore, May 2016 "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Out with the old,30,27 May 2016,"Went to Newton to see its latest incarnation,a bit too sanitised for us.It was Mothers day weekend and very busy. We were instantly bombarded with large menus in our faces from stall holders, it gave you no chance to have a good look at all the stalls. Found a shared table eventually, ordered the food and then went for drinks.The prices we paid were nearly 50% more than Maxwell rd. and it was mostly seafood on offer, we also like to pay for food as we order it, the people on the other end of our table were having a dispute with a stall holder about overcharging them.A good halfway house between Maxwells or Lau pa sat and a restaurant."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Yummy, cheap and fun",40,26 May 2016,"Great hawker market for a cheap meal in Singapore. Lots of stalls around the edges with tables in the middle the only problem is deciding what to try! We had a delicious satay and fried carrot cake with two very cold large beers. Top food, great experience wish I could have dinner here every night!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",More expensive than other hawker centres ,30,22 May 2016,"A lot of seafood served here so ideal if you want seafood, not as much variety and seemed more expensive than other hawker centres iv been to. Just across the road from Newton train station"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newly Refurbished Seafood Hawker Centre,30,19 May 2016,"A good hawker centre for seafood. We went on Mother's day so it was very very busy, our last visit was 15 years ago and sadly IMHO it had changed for the worse. I now much prefer Maxwell, Chinatown or even some of the enclosed food centres. It was busy mostly with locals so they can't all be wrong. Because it specialises in seafood the meals are generally more expensive than other centres. But not really expensive compared to restaurants. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food and great prices,40,9 May 2016,"Don't come here just for the seafood. Eat what the locals eat! You can barely see locals ordering seafood here, so look around the tables to get an idea of what to eat.Some recommendations that won't break the bank will be oyster omelette, prawn noodles with soup, fish soup noodles, fried prawn noodles, fried noodles (char kway teow) and shaved ice to top it off!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tiger Prawns & Stingray,50,5 May 2016,We have just spent three days in Singapore and had lunch at the Newton Hawker Centre twice. The tiger prawns cooked with lots of garlic and the stingray with a hot sauce were fantastic. Had them both days. Beer was also pretty cheap with a big bottle of Tiger only $7.50 (compared to what you would pay in a bar or hotel for a small bottle). Definitely recommend.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Some good things to try (other than the seafood),40,5 May 2016,"Long before Newton Hawker Center came to be associated with expensive grilled seafood for tourists, locals used to come here for :1. Tanglin Hokkien noodles and oyster omelette 2. Bee Heng popiah and satay3. Heng fied carrot cake (this is actually mashed turnip/radish fried with egg, garlic and spring onions and, as an option - a sweet black sauce).We visited this evening for takeout of the Hokkein noodles, chicken satay and popiah. The Hokkein noodles fried fresh prawns and squid and a tasty prawn stock and, served with delicious sambal chilli and freshly squeezed lime juice was as good as it ever was (in high priced Singapore portions have shrunk though).The satay (boneless chicken skewered on wooden sticks and grilled) was fragrant and tender as was the roasted peanut gravy it was served with.The popiah didn't live up to expectations though - this is similar in concept to the Vietnamese rice paper rolls. The SE Asian version has stewed turnip, crunchy peanuts, chopped boiled egg and lettuce wrapped in thin popiah skin made from rice flour. The popiah skin does not have the translucent sticky texture of the Vietnamese version - it has a drier more grainy texture. What we got at Newton though was a little too dried out and the stewed turnip didn't have the depth of flavour we remembered. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Cuisine.,40,4 May 2016,"Day 1 of our brief trip to Singapore concluded with dinner at this well known Hawker Centre in Newton Circus. A short taxi ride away from our Hotel.One is spoilt for choice at this venue with several hawkers all offering the same menu - be it seafood, or Malay Muslim cuisine, etc. Other hawkers only deal in fruit juices, soft drinks and beers.After a brief wander, we decided on Takara Grilled Seafood (Shop No. 74) run by Winnie.My wife and I shared the Black Pepper Singapore Crab, a baby Stingray and a portion of Seafood Noodles - ample quantities and really delicious. We had asked Winnie to hold the spice which was done.....The Hawker Centre was bustling and appears very popular with both residents and tourists. We returned to our hotel by Metro as Newton Station is a short walk away from the Hawker Centre."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonably delicious food,30,1 May 2016,"Opened on 24 April 2016 after renovation. Been a regular there for many years, prices are not very cheap. Be careful, especially the stall owners and touts like to overcharge foreigners, although that happening now is lesser as stalls face punishment if they tout. Follow the queues. Sporeans are food junkies. They know where is the best food. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ripoff,20,1 May 2016,This is a classic ripoff hawker center. You need to challenge the prices if you are a foreigner because they always try to cheat you. I used to live very near and went there many times. Just beware
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic and delicious seafood,50,28 April 2016,Very good variety of local cuisine and also alot of fresh seafood dishes to choose from. Would recommend this place to many tourists as the place accomodates to many people and has quite a huge varety of local dishes. One may also compare this to the famous Lau Pa Sat which is another food place enjoyed by both locals and tourists. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing Seafood!,50,24 April 2016,"Fresh cheap and you cannot go wrong here!
Personal favourite spot!
The 'Chilli Crab' is amazing too! Everthing thing else really is actually!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable but not the best,30,21 April 2016,"Newton is a tourist food market in my opinion, the taxi drivers will try to take you there if asked where is a good place to go. There are plenty of stalls to choose from and don't worry about the stall owners hassling you just find a seat then walk around the stalls to see what you like, the routers will try to get you to sit in their stall location. The food is very good and a reasonable price but can get better else where cheaper. It is an experience to say the least. Take a taxi or the MRT is right there as well so easy to get to. Funny enough we have den there several times and stall 69 s eels to be a good place to site and eat but have a look your self before choosing.There are clean toilets on site which us a bonus"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful on the per 100g prices,30,20 April 2016,"We lived close by for quite a while so we went here now and again, the food is ok but its so easy to spend a lot if you start ordering what they are famous for - seafood. Many of the prices are per 100g and the cost quickly adds up. Its worth a visit but you definitely need to confirm the price before you order. The vendors will let you run up a bill before they let you know"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Closed for renovation & off the topic,40,26 March 2016,"Wanted to visit Newton Circus last night, but the taxi driver convinced us that the place has been closed. So decided to visit Lau Pa Sat instead after 20 years. No reason to go back there again. Food was below par, the whole place was somehow very messy. Very crowded though, so not everyone may share our feeling.Just checked, according to the National Environment Agency homepage Newton Circus is closed on 1 February - 24 April 2016. Suprised to see some reviews from February visits.Anyway, waiting for the next visit to Newton. Maybe not the most original of hawker centers, but we've always been happy with the food and service in general."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and cheerful.,50,25 March 2016,Experience good food and mix with the locals. Close to the MRT. Chilli crab is a must. Table service from Aunty was awesome!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and delicious,50,16 March 2016,"This place is a large outdoor foodcourt. Its a hawker centre, opens later in the day. Plenty of tourist and locals eat here. Food is pretty cheap here. I spent $5 in total for a decent meal with a drink here. The skewers are the best, costing me only 60c per stick. No table service, and no air-conditioning, its outdoor. So its a bit hot and humid, but thats normal singapore weather. Overall, an enjoyable experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware of overpriced items,30,20 February 2016,"Very good variety of local food. However, tourists must beware. Some of these hawkers will sell you food that are way overpriced. Eating in a hawker centre should be a cheap and affordable experience. Not an expensive one. Check prices of items before ordering and you will never go wrong."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singaporean Cuisine,40,18 February 2016,"Having read about hawker centres we wanted to experience one and this was the closest to our hotel (walking distance) I read that all Singapore eateries are hygiene rated and whilst a hawker stall rarely if ever achieves A status there are plenty of B status to choose from. The food we chose was very very tasty and very very cheap, the most expensive thing was beer. Well worth a visit if you want to experience the real food of Singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food court - good atmosphere,30,18 February 2016,"Decent food court that seems to specialise in seafood. Not as much of a tourist trap as expected, although not the cheapest food for hawker centre. Food was ok quality however, and lots of choice. A good stop for my first night back in Singapore!Was very busy, but there are lots of tables, so seating rarely an issue. It does have a good feeling about it though, not quite so drab and functional as some of the other hawker centres in town. Good place to get acclimatised."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy,40,17 February 2016,Make sure you try the chilli crab and chilly stingray we sometimes make a special effort when in Asia to visit Singapore just to eat at this hawker centre
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Night for Big Groups,40,9 February 2016,"Superb evening that lasted well towards midnight, must be the cheapest way to have ice-cold beers with friends in Singapore. The outdoor style is lovely but it gets very hot! Love the carrot cake place and the pirate seafood stall! Delicious! Clean toilets and great choice of local delights! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Total Rip off,10,7 February 2016,"This place is a total rip off and tourist trap. Food is average at best. Go to other hawker center for better experience such as Maxwell, Tiong Bahru, etc. The locals don't come here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hit and miss....,30,5 February 2016,Some vendors are bad. Some are good. This is a tourist trap. Prices are higher than other place. If you want to try chili crab and xereal prswns. Expect to pay around 100 sg. 40 sg for crab 25 to 40 for prawns depends on size of plate you order. Tables always full but you can find a seat. Alot of people eat and leave. Tried to order satay from 1 vendor told me sold out... but had alot of sticks still in stall.Tried to order oyster egg. Vendor told me dont order unless you willing to wait 30 mins. Crab was nothing special. Boiled crab. Pour chili sauce on it.Cereal prawns. Fresh and ok... but not my type of dish.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Essential For Experiencing Singapore,50,2 February 2016,"I consider this Hawker Food Centre a ''Must'' to visit every time I'm in Singapore . The choice of regional dishes is very large indeed , and I'm never disappointed , regardless of what I elect to eat any particular evening ... be it Thai , or Indian or the standard Singaporian noodle dishes in any of their many varieties . Fish , meat , fowl , or vegetarian , it all seems good to me ! Price per basic dish is almost invariably under $10 , and satay costs 70cents a stick . Plenty of choice of drinks , tho' I invariably go for the freshly opened coconut + a straw while waiting for my order of food to be served .The layout of this Centre has changed very considerably from its previous format . The hawker food stalls are arranged around a central open air eating area ( though there is a fair amount of covered eating available if it rains ) . One would do well to check the weather forecast on the excellent local web site NEA-MISS before going ! I recommend taking a stroll round all the stalls in the outer perimeter to see what takes one's fancy . Do not be pressurised by any vendor into taking a seat alongside his particular stall until you've made up you mind ( or unless you are by yourself ) . Otherwise pick seating for yourselves , preferably in the central open area , before you go and order any dish .... but you MUST remember your table number to place your order ( and exactly where it is , so YOU can find your way back to it again ) Leave one of you at the table to ''reserve'' your seats while the other(s) place orders .I've always found the food quality very good , and frequently excellent , but it's a matter of personal taste , and sometimes of luck . What is encouraging is the number of ''locals'' packing into the place for an evening meal . Extremely easy to get to . Take the MRT to Newton station , and it's a 5 minute walk from there . Savour the food as much as you'll enjoy the buzz of the experience . Enjoy !"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow experience - Hawker centre unlike any,50,1 February 2016,"Visited twice for dinner during my stay in Singapore. Essentially the Hawkers have almost identical food, but what differentiates each of them is the personal touch in the taste based on the hawkers own style conditioned from the individual cultural & regional backgrounds. Must try the Chilli beef and the sting-ray. You can also order beers from and RTD bottles from most of the hawkers and have a drink with your meal. Great place to visit with friends, family or even a lone traveller."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An interesting evening,40,29 January 2016,"I had previous eaten in the Hawker market in both Chinatown and Little India, however this was a difference experience. Being more little stands to chose from. My friends and I several types of food. Chinese, Indian, and Japanese. The atmosphere is really lively and lots of fun. The real plus was lots of tables with umbrellas if the weather gets wet, and a restroom with plenty of area to wash up after the somewhat messy chili crabs."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good social eating,50,25 January 2016,"Dress down, chill out, dining with a beer!! Based around a set courtyard with vendors serving diners in reach of their cabin. This place is 24 hours and is also respected for its cleanliness - Worth the cab ride!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lifeless at lunch and not an environmental friendly food center compared to Whampoa Food Center,20,20 January 2016,"We explored the Newton Hawker, Lau Pa Sat and a local hawker center called Whampoa Hawker Center during our recent trip to Singapore. Amongst the 3, we rated Newton the lowest. We visited Newton and Whampoa for lunch respectively. Whampoa, which is connected to a local housing estate, has long lines in many stalls during lunch and is full of life. We were indeed on our way to Newton and the taxi driver recommended Whampoa instead of Newton. We tried the Hainanese boneless chicken rice, and the spicy turnip, peanut, bean sprout, pineapple salad at Balestier Road Hoover Rojak, made famous by HK movie star Chow Yun Fat. All utensils are reusable, a big thumbs up from our family as we care a lot about the environment. The atmosphere is friendly, pricing is affordable and the service is great. The next day we made a trip to Newton because of our positive experience at Whampoa. Over 2/3 of the stalls at Newton were not opened, so it's pretty lifeless. We had a Ba Kut Teh (pork rib soup) and a roasted chicken rice. Food quality was okay. Yet the food stalls in general use a lot of disposable utensils and styrofoam. It is not at all impressive. Please also note that Newton will be closed for renovation from Feb - Apr 2016."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive and a rip off,20,17 January 2016,"Stall 82 (Lucky) served up some good BBQ sting ray with sambal sauce. They charged us $14 per butterfly prawns which was tasteless and tough after being overcooked. They had sprinkled on some half cooked garlic for flavour. Massive rip off. Stall 73 served a tasty oyster omelette but you only get a very small amount of oysters. Stall 13, the famous duck noodles was salty and the saltiness was so overpowering. Their curry char siew, nothing to write home about. So disappointing. Other hawker centres have much tastier and cheaper food. Will not come again even if it is just around the cnr from home."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Busy with great variety,50,16 January 2016,"Visited with friends. This food is mildly cheaper than the food courts in the shopping centres but the atmosphere was much better.Look at the vendors shop fronts. If it says ""self service"" it means you have to take your food to the table, if not, they will deliver the food to you (so take note of your table number). We had the Char Siu, steamed veges, butter chicken Paneer, naan & satay. All very nice. Adequate portions."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a trip,40,15 January 2016,Easily found close to the MRT line. Cheap with a wide variety of food.. High turn over with fresh quality food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good fun!,40,13 January 2016,"We caught a cab here one night particularly for chilli crab. It only cost us about S$18 by cab from the Carlton hotel. We walked around before choosing which hawker we would eat at. The prices all seem much the same. We had 4 huge prawns around 200g ea, we paid $8 per 100g so $16 per prawn. Our crab was a medium size & cost us $40. We bought beers from the stall next door. It was a great fun experience & the food tasted great!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Make sure this is on your list of places to eat whilst in Singapore! ,50,10 January 2016,"We visited 'Newton Circus' 3 times whilst in Singapore and each time was amazing All stores are basically the same type of food/dishes and quality, so doesn't matter what stall you order from, you're guaranteed a tasty, cheap meal! $4 per 100g for crab, (make sure you find out the weight of the crab before purchasing, we got a kg crab which was about $40aud) then choose your flavour, we tried the black pepper crab on our first visit and chilli crab on our 2nd, both were amazingly tasty, sweet juicy crab meat! Very messy, but definitely worth it, don't forget to order a portion of fried buns to mop up all the juices! The prawns are also tasty, but again just make sure you find out how much they weigh before ordering, otherwise you could end up with a massive bill (and a lot of wasted food) we had one prawn each, this prawn was as long and wide as my hand when sliced down the centre! Plump and juicy! One was more than enough, the equivalent of maybe 6 Australian king prawns! We also tried blachan stingray, and oh my god, what a flavour explosion! Another must try when in Singapore! Drinks are also cheap, around $2 for a soft drink and about $7 for a beer/cider. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Singapore! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Cheap food, cheap drinks, great deal",50,10 January 2016,"We knew the food would be good and cheap. The big bonus was cheap beer (compared to every other venue in town). A big bottle of Tiger set me back $9.50 which is considerably better than the $12 to $18 for a small bottle in other city venues. Food preparation was fast and the taste was awesome. Everything was fresh as these vendors go through a lot of product nightly. Go on your own, as a couple, as a family, or as a group of friends on a night out. Make this the starting point for dinner before hitting the town."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic food and great experience,50,9 January 2016,"We went to this hawkers' market and were delighted with the food. We were helped by the man at the A1 food stall who organised for a table in the middle to be cleared for us. He then explained how things work there and ordered drinks for us. We ordered our meal from him and he brought us the most delicious noodles, chilli crab and garlic prawns all for $75 for 2 people. He brought us a large finger bowl as the crab is messy to eat and then when we finished he brought over some wet wipes. There's a great atmosphere there with about 80 stalls to choose from. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker hawkers more hawkers food ,50,5 January 2016,So many selections of local specialities only wish I have more stomach to try them all !! Chilli crab is not to be missed ..can be pricey but still lot cheaper than other places ..make sure to tell the waiter to show you the catch or the weight of the crab before it gets cooked so you have an idea how much the dish will cost 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food ,50,23 December 2015,"Great food and a fantastic way to experience Singapore food hawker culture, can have a number of different dishes and enjoy a great taste variety , my favourites are stingray, Kang Kong with sambal and chilli prawns delicious"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing choice of yummy and cheap food,50,16 December 2015,"I never go to Singapore without going to Newton Hawker Center. If you haven't ever been to a Food/Hawker center in Singapore, Do it!!! It's the cheapest way to eat while in Singapore. I've been to a few hawker centers around Singapore and this one is the biggest and best I've been to. There are tables and chairs set up in the center, they are surrounded by loads of food stalls selling a variety of Malaysian, Indo, Chinese food. Each stall sells something specific, some serve drinks, some don't. Find a table first, place a packet of tissues on the table to 'hold' it (or have someone sit there and mind the table), take note of the table number, then go in search for food of your choice. Some stalls will ask for your table number and bring it over when ready, others may make you wait while they cook it. Must tries are; BBQ stingray, fried squid, satay skewers, Otah and cold bean curd. And of cause a large bottle of Tiger beer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","whenever in Singapore, a visit to the Newton Hawker Center is a must",40,9 December 2015,"The location is excellent, the variety of food superb. No matter what is your taste, Chinese, Fish, Malay, Indian, Thai.......you'll for sure find what you are looking for. A lot of family business guarantee a perfect service."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A variety of choices,40,7 December 2015,"Ideally located opposite Newton MRT, this food centre offers an array of choices - mostly Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Indian & Thai cuisine."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, fun experience",40,3 December 2015,"This was a fun experience. To set the scene, the hawker stalls are basically in a circle, with an open air eating area in the centre. You walk in and start doing a lap to pick out what looks good. If you don't enjoy the hawker experience then avoid this place. There is a good range of food to choose from, including Singapore Chilli Crab. We got our Singapore Chilli Crab from Mrs Tan at stall 66, although I believe she normally works out of stall 72. We got some satay sticks from stall 74, and a cold beer to wash it down. I wouldn't call the food cheap, but it wasn't too expensive either. in fact, all things considered, the beer was relatively the most expensive thing there at $7 SD a glass. The food was quick and tasty. The meal was all the more enjoyable because the stall operator Mrs tan came over to chat with us. Do make sure you have plenty of napkins as the Singapore Crab is messy. Worth the visit for the experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local gem!,40,2 December 2015,"If you want some tasty, local and value for money food and a typical Singaporean experience then head to Newton hawker centre - 2 mins walk from the Newton MRT station.Lots of food stalls selling a variety of food and drinks, great place to take friends as its such a social place. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton circus,50,21 November 2015,"We recently ate dinner at this hawker centre, the food was fantastic. Store 70 had fantastic food, also satay close by had great food also. Reasonable price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Salty egg crab ,50,21 November 2015,I have tried several different chilli crab places and salty crab places - they all taste different. I was told on the first day by the store owners they are all the same taste. I have to recommend stall 19 for their salty egg crab. Mr and toddler loved it. We went back everyday of our stay in Singapore. Price is decent and a variety of dishes chilli or not. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli Crab,50,16 November 2015,We went during the day which we found out is not a popular time but we still had the chilli crab my husband was chasing. Cost was $40 and the taste was top notch! He also had sambal stingray for $12 which he loved aswell. I had pork and noddles which cost me $5 - make the effort.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Varieties of different Foods,30,13 November 2015,"Went to Newton Hawker Center where the choice of food is endless ranging from Malay, Chinese, Curries,and many desserts. At each table there is number, which you need to inform food staller so he can bring your order. Please bring your own napkins as I found out that most eateries do not supply .The food at Newton Hawker Center is relatively inexpensive. We had Hainese Chicken with rice which cost about $5 and also Tom Yum Shrimp noodle soup for $5 for dinner. Both dishes were Ok, but you can do better Lau Pau Sat Food Center which has over 200 food stalls and it is cheaper."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","More savvy, much better experience.",40,10 November 2015,"The last time I was here, I had an absolute shocker. Armed with some better knowledge, and a little bit of caution, a much improved experience. Do not eat anything that does not have a price. A huge variety of local food, follow the locals and eat where it's busy and you won't go wrong. Use some common sense and you will not be disappointed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satays Galore,50,6 November 2015,"If you are looking for cheap and reasonable eateries, this is it! Good variety of Asian and freshly squeezed juices, beer and what ever drink takes your fancy. You just have to visit just once and make your mind up."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere and serves food until late!,40,6 November 2015,"We were really impressed having visited many hawker centres which closed early however this was open really late!Normal priced hawker food, various standard types - Indian, Malay, chicken rice (!). Normal priced beer for a hawker centre, around $6.Only thing that means it isn't a 5* rating is the people in the middle of the hawker centre who hawk and try to get you to buy food from certain stalls and pressure you into buying beer from them. Annoying and off putting.Aside from that, was great!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Full of festivity at night ,50,2 November 2015,"So this is suppose to be a tourist trap but it's still so fun. Come at night for dinner or supper simply because there is so many people around. A lot of the stalls seem to sell the same thing which is seafood of various sorts which if fun once in a while. if you are want the more simple stuff like various noodles, po piah or oyster omelette. The thing is there is plenty of choice and there are so many stalls to choose from. It's open air so it can be hot. During the day, it's just not as much fun so it's really a place to come to at night. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Locals tell me to avoid this place - A tourist trap,30,1 November 2015,"And so I do, Unless I want thai from 52. The only thai place there. I like the green curry with rice. The store owners are in your face and off-putting for my liking. And even the local paper claims that they overcharge. If you want what the locals like go to Tekka centre. The bus 66 or 67 from newton will take you there easily within 5 minutes. I found the best Garlic naan and chicken tikka.Hawker centres are warm so be ready with a hanky or two."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Choose what locals eat,40,30 October 2015,"Take time to observe before you choose which stall you'll buy your food. If it's frequented by locals, chances are...the food is good. I ordered duck from this outer stall facing the parking lot. Quite unimpressive and only a few duck meat (contrary to what their pictures showed). "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Spoilt for choice,40,30 October 2015,"We came here on the recommendation of a colleague from Singapore. Having stayed at a hotel for a three day work do and not seen much else than the hotel we were keen to use the last remaining hours before our flight back to the UK seeing and tasting the real Singapore. The main problem we were faced with on arrival was the vast choice! Hunger built as we browsed the stalls and took in the sights and smells of pad thai, laksa, curries, crispy duck, satay and lots and lots of other local delicacies. We settled on some thai food that looked super-fresh, pad thai easily the best I've ever had and a green papaya salad not far behind. It's all very basic with paper plates and plastic cutlery, you drink your coke straight from the can, but the food is the main attraction and well worth the $15 cab fare. After a big gala dinner the night before we were also relieved to find it was the best hangover cure ever!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",don't change what is not broken ,40,24 October 2015,"Newton was my preference to go to after flying in to Singapore on a Friday evening. As a child my parents would use to bring us to visit . Not much has changed ., there are plentiful of choice, Chinese food. Indian , Malay and old favorites plus seafood n great dessert stalls As usual the eye was bigger than the stomach ! We have grilled sting ray with chili sambal - the best ! $12 The satays 80 cents each with min order of 10 sticks were good ! Fried egg oysters, Chinese style fried carrot cake n Indian mamak style fried instant noodle was on order tonightPlus durian ice kachang ! N freshly squeezed sugar cane juice , Great n tasty on a warm eveningLove the fact that you order what you like, choose the size you want and they bring the food to you . Most of these stalls are long time vendors and will still be here for many years to comeAh Newton .. We will certainly be back "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",My favourite spot.,50,20 October 2015,"I could eat here everyday, such is the variety. Yes there are hawks, hence the name but it's all part of the charm to me.Some of the items on offer are genuinely excellent, and of good value. This the signature centre for a reason and has to be part of your itinerary into SG!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overhyped & overpriced,30,20 October 2015,The food is mediocre and the location unimpressive. Merely targetting the gullible tourist. I'd give this place a miss and opt for takeaway from the neighbouring 7/11.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great seafood at Stall 70 - Mrs Tan,50,19 October 2015,"Thank you Mrs Tan for a great meal on Sunday night. Our buttered king prawns with garlic, calamari rings, fried rice and stir fried bok choy were delicious!!! Highly recommend you eat from Mrs Tan at Stall 70 when in Singapore!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food!!,40,16 October 2015,"Been to newtons hawker Center many times over the years. The seafood options are very good. My favourite dishes are the sambal prawns, and Sri Lankan pepper crab!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but you have to pick well,40,10 October 2015,I've been here before but it's always good to visit again. You can get good food here but it's not as cheap as some other places but it's still good value. Just be wary of the touts trying to get you to sit down and they try to order for you. Try the oyster omelette and the chili crab. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit booth #70 - Ms Tan.,50,6 October 2015,"First of all, #70 serves a variety of lovely food in a great and thriving environment you find at Newton Food Center. Second, Ms Tan offers the best hospitality. She is a great mix of being very welcoming and attentive, but on a very comfortable level, as opposed to many others who can be a bit too much. Definitely a place I go to eat every time I visit the city, which I also recommend to all my friends, and now also YOU."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent food and great price,50,29 September 2015,"Great food, recommend you look for the lady who takes care of the seafood, chicken and beer stands. far side from the carpark on the side near the road/roundabout"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must try,50,29 September 2015,"I would move to Singapore again, just to be near the Hawker food. And Newton Circus is one of the best ones in town. The food is fresh, the place is clean, and if you cannot find what you want here - you will never be happy."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoyable experience,40,23 September 2015,"This is safe street food Singapore style. There is a little bit of hustle from the vendors, but too be honest I have had a lot worse in the past. Plenty of food choices, reasonable prices for SG. All three of us ate from different stall holders and a good was quickly delivered to our tables. Worthy of a visit and if you fancy street food then you know you will be safe here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The place to eat in Singapore,50,22 September 2015,"If you ever come to Singapore, this is the place to eat. My husband and I have travelled the world and out of all the places we have eaten, this is our favourite, it is just amazing. The atmosphere is electrifying, it's just buzzing all night long. When you get there just have a walk round the different food stalls to see what you want to eat. You choose a table, all of which are numbered and give the table number to the stall holder and as soon as you have ordered and it's cooked,they bring it over to you. You will be asked by many stall holders to eat at their stall but you can tell them you are looking around and they will leave you alone, they are really friendly. When you have finished your food you can order some more and they bring it over, you pay at the end when you have finished. Our son didn't travel with us on this occasion and he was gutted that we were going to Newton Circus because he loved the food especially sweet and sour chicken. You can buy drink after drink from many stall holders. There are toilets available which are kept clean which is a nice change to some places you may travel. You can catch a taxi just outside the hawker centre. This is a must for anyone wanting to eat with the locals, I can't recommend it enough. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of stalls but mostly same type of food,40,21 September 2015,"Very big food court with lots of stalls. However most of stalls sell the same food with same price. I'd say you have about 4-5 stalls that sell seafood, 4-5 that sell brochettes etc. very nice ambiance. Place is amazingly clean considering the number of people and size of the place. Beware of people at the entrance guiding you to a table. Since they are selling mostly the same food, they literally jump on you to sell you their menu. If you refuse to buy than start the insults...i cursed at the dude for being so impolite and on my way out he started the same manège with other tourists... Other than that enjoy the food!!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit Mrs Tan at no 70.,40,21 September 2015,"To get a really good experience of a Singapore food court, visit the Newton Hawker centre. I have been there a couple of times now and the food is good. I particularly like Mrs Tan at no.70, especially if you like seafood. The beers & drinks are supplied from next door. Word of warning...you will get inundated by people trying to sell you there food....don't accept the first person, take a good look. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere. Great streetfood,40,19 September 2015,"A must go in Singapore. Experience the hawker streetfood and eat among the locals. Good solid food. Great variety, since 20+ small kitchens and basic seating & eating facilities under open sky. In general only cash payment. Serves beer as well."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great night out, fabulous atmosphere...",50,17 September 2015,"We spend our first evening in Singapore at Newton Hawker Centre, arrived by taxi and found a table. It was very busy with lots of activity going on. Tourists and locals all eating out and the lots of food choices. It was easy to purchase a variety of food and have it brought to the table and accompanied by a cold beer made it a fun night. Chili crab, noodles, skewers, curries, stir fry everything was available to order. Great night out.."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun clean with excellent Street Food,50,12 September 2015,"Recently met up with a number of old school mates for a reunion in Singapore and we decided on having a street food night, Newton Circle came immediately to mind as it is fairly centrally located and is on the main MRT track through town. Arrived around 7pm, already quite busy with many already well advanced in their street food experience. You go around to various food stalls and order what you want, sometimes you need to pay there and then with others you pay when your dish gets delivered. Each table has a number so you best remember that when ordering otherwise you may wait a long time and go hungry. We had a great mixture of Indian and Chinese dishes along with a few plates of very nice chicken satay (always a must!) all washed down with a few Tigers and real coconut milk straight from the coconut. Prices were a little on the high side for street food, but it is a tourist attraction. A fun night was had by all and would certainly head back to Newton Circle next time I am in Singletree."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",#27 Delicious chili crab!!!,40,11 September 2015,I like to introduce my one of favorite chili crab restaurant.I like the chili taste. And I love to eat crab. So Chilli Crab is my best food.That's why I used to go there and eat chili crab even I am alone.This food is very reasonalbe price and also delicious.ANd Korea and Japan tourists come and eat in this restaurant.I truely recommend this restaurant.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","SHOP 70, NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT SINGAPORE CAN OFFER",20,6 September 2015,"I have been going to Singapore for over 40 years and have always had a good opinion of the people and the food over the years, so much so that I suggested to my friend on her first visit to Singapore that we eat at Newton Hawker centre for dinner. I had a Thai meal which was lovely but my friend fell for the slick, smooth talk of the lady serving on stall number 70. As is normal you pay by the weight in seafood but I doubt that any stretch of the imagination could accept that one prawn cost $22 as the serving lady said it was 150 grms - firstly that was added up incorrectly and when we pointed that out to her she flew into a rage saying that my friend was getting it cheap, secondly that was the end of the service - no cutlery, no drink, no serviette and rude whispering behind my friend's back, plus having the fan moved from us to them. It was a particularly humid evening. I do not know if the owners of that stall realized how much their shop will be effected by a rude and aggressive employee but I do know that the owner next door to them was very apologetic to my friend over the rudeness of the employee in shop 70. A word to everyone - ask to watch when your prawn or other seafood is weighed and also make sure that the maths are correct when you get the bill and do not be afraid of speaking up if it is not right.  Would I go back again - probably not because I have been to a lot of hawker food areas in Singapore and I think that Newton has out priced itself for no good reason and unless you travel by train it is very difficult to get a taxi in that area."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to experience Asian food,40,30 August 2015,"Had been to this place as it was recommended by several friends and found it really nice, I tried fish head curry (not remembering the stall name) and it was niceIf you are staying in Singapore for long then can mark this place as ""to visit"""
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another cool food hall,40,30 August 2015,"Okay, this is basically another food hall, but as I have suggested previously I really do love these places, so when I got of the MRT at Newton to visit some place else (Sarkies Road) I decided to step in here and have a look around. Okay, I'm not sure if there is anything in Newton that would attract the average tourist (a category that I generally don't fall into) but the food hall is certainly worth a visit. There are plenty of stalls to chose from, though most of them were closed when I was here (which probably had something to do with the time of day). Still, there was enough available for me to partake in some of the goodies."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Place for Dining Asian Food,50,26 August 2015,"We caught the train from Somerset MRT (Red Line to Jurong East), only two stops and a short walk to the food centre. There is a variety of Asian food available, please walk around and pick the food you wish to eat. We had Chilli Crab from stall 49 (Denmark), the food was very tasty and not expensive. Good value for money, a must visit place in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic selection of Asian cuisine,40,21 August 2015,"With a variety of Asian food on offer it's very hard not to find something not to like. It's a great experience too. It was my Thai girlfriend's first trip out of Thailand, even though she enjoyed the Char Siew pork rice and satay her day was made when we discovered a Thai food stall. All in all a good meal had and thoroughly recommended for first time visitors to Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food centres in Singapore,40,20 August 2015,"Singapore's food centres are always the right places for tourists to enjoy local cuisines. In my opinion, Newton is the best if you wish to taste all signature Singaporean dishes, ranging from satay to pepper crabs, from char kway meow to sting ray at one time. Once you enter the centre area, staff members from different stalls will approach you cordially. Just ignore them until you find a suitable one. After you have ordered a few dishes from that stall, you will then be 'free' to buy food from other stalls and you can enjoy a 'nuisance-free' dinner. P.S. There are always water basins around the corners, so you can feel free to savour the palatable seafood in Newton!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local food scene,40,19 August 2015,"A bit of the local food scene with lots of seafood dishes and a mix of beverages stalls.
A located a short walk away from the MRT and there's lots to choose from."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beautiful Singapore Chilli Crab ,40,11 August 2015,"We came to the Hawker Centre to enjoy a more authentic meal rather than sitting I a high end restaurant ... And we weren't disappointed. After the initial negotiating to get a table we got sorted. Having a range of food and restaurants available, once I ordered from the 'owner' who secured us a table, my husband was able to go off and order what he wanted without the same pressure/hassling. It didn't worry me as I was on a mission to have chilli crab - and it was all I hoped it would be. I was promised that it wasn't too hot - and the promised was fulfilled. The sauce had a bit of a bite, but not too much. The crab had been cracked allowing the sauce to soak through ... So the flavour came through as I sucked out the crab. The only problem was trying to clean myself up afterwards. Little tissues only served as a temporary measure until I could get more serious.Restaurant 43, in a corner with a yellow background is a good place to head! And the Indian next door looked good - and tasted fine according to my husband."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Large variety. Great Indian food.,50,10 August 2015,Great Indian curries (or dozens of alternatives) and ice cold tiger beers (7.50 a large bottle). Fantastic experience. I don't have kids but observed the hawker staff being very friendly and accommodating to the families around me so would say this is a good option for young families. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety and cheap,40,8 August 2015,"The place crowded but fun, because you served with varieties of food, but the famous food here will be singapor carrot cakr and oyster cake. A must try place when you visit singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheaper Eats,50,4 August 2015,"Have dined at Hawker #19 on two separate Singapore trips & the food & service is always spot on! Their Chilli Crab is delicious, messy & affordable!
The nearby drinks stall is always great, super fast & reasonably priced!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great place to experience a hawker centre for the uninitiated.,50,20 July 2015,"Somewhat of a Singapore institution for travellers. A great overall experience of deciding and choosing what to eat and drink, together with great people watching. A great atmosphere. Filled with a good mix of locals, expats, business people out for dinner meetings and of course tourists. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",not spectacular,30,19 July 2015,"The location was great in relation to our hotel (Sheraton), however comparatively speaking, the food were ok at best as nothing stood out, and the highlight of the night was the Pale Ale."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quality local food,40,12 July 2015,"If you are after an e prince of local food and cheap prices you can not go past Newtons Hawkers Markets in the evenings. There is a large selection of local foods. Do t be stressed out by the pressure of dome hawkers wanting you to sit at there tables to eat you can mix and match. Ethereal were 8 of us and we all got our meals and a couple of beers and soft drinks for $60 total there is a large variety to choice from, I found this to be one of the cheaper quality eateries in Si galore, a taxi should not cost you more then $20 from the central part of Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always a good atmosphere ,40,11 July 2015,Newton might have a reputation of being a more touristy hawker place but so long as you don't mind paying a few extra dollars it's a great place to go. Good selection of stalls (Indian palace is our fave) and they bring the dishes to your table. So no walking around and waiting for numerous different meals for the family. We like!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The breakfast of champions,50,10 July 2015,"Having looked briefly at the overpriced breakfast at the Sheraton I walked across the street to get breakfast at the Newton Hawker Center. At that early time there were only a few stands open, among which a fruit/smoothie stand, a noodle and duck stand, a congee stand, and a drink stand. The noodle with duck chunks in a dark soup was spectacular. The coffee was the usual sweet milk Singapore coffee (no espresso makers here). The fruit fresh. The whole thing cost seven singapore dollars, the same as a cup of better coffee in the Sheraton dining room. Hawker centers are a unique (as far as I know) Singaporean feature, and I have never been disappointed. In Singapore I only go to restaurants for the ambience !!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Hawker centre with a bit of space,40,3 July 2015,"Newton Circus Hawker centre is unlike most of the others because it has lots of seating spread out in the centre of the Hawker stalls, that aside the food is the same as all of the others great Sate, Chilli Stingray, BBQ pork and lots of seafood brill!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap frequented by locals,30,30 June 2015,"While not how it was in it's hayday, the food quality and value are exceptional on different ends of the spectrum. Food is excellent and fresh but you could get the same dishes for 25% of the price from other more local hawkers. I would recommend this as a stop for tourists, but not a replacement for Little India or China Town. Be sure to wash down your meal with large Tiger."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not as it used to be, but still, great 24 hour seafood place!",30,30 June 2015,"There's not as much selection of food as there used to be - more seafood but if that's what you're looking for, Newton Hawker Centre is great! Also, 24-hour Singaporean local food choice near town so very convenient for a late night snack!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Market,50,29 June 2015,"We were told the Newton Hawker market or Newton Food center was known for its seafood. We ate here twice for dinner and loved it. We tried chili crab, BBQ stingray, satay, garlic naan and craft (also draft) beer. We went one night at 6 and one at 7 pm. It really seemed to pick up during that hour. At 6 you have a choice of table but at 7, the temperature is cooling off, more stalls are open, our preferred time. The satay was 60 cents with a min of 10 satay. However, I was able to eat 20 satay alone! The chili crab was around $35SD and the BBQ stingray was $22SD. Both were very good. We were surprised by how much we liked the stingray. We weren't bothered by people trying to show us their menu. We just kept walking, grabbed a table and my husband went from stall to stall ordering for our family. We also at at Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell Hawker centers and this was my favorite."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Love the variety of food here! Great for tourists!,40,19 June 2015,This place is great. Must try the stall No 53. The sambal kangkong and BBQ stingray here is awesome. Especially their chili!!!! There are other decent food like carrot cake and XO noodle here as well. Satays and chicken wings are pretty much okay.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",No. 70 Mrs Tan lives up to great expectation,40,13 June 2015,"Having read reviews of the food here, we went along and wasn't disappointed to share an evening with Mrs Tan's attentiveness serving up wonderful food. So good, we'll return again and again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker food at its best ,50,7 June 2015,"A few reviews we saw about this place suggested the food vendors were pushy. We didn't experience any of that. We were able to sit & determine what we wanted which consisted of mutabar, satay and beer (well it was Friday night) and we orders & received all in good time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thoroughly pleasant & filling experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good cheap hawker food and beer. A must visit!,50,5 June 2015,"A must visit for all whether you've been before in past years as I have in the 1980's or are new to it. Very good satay, Laksa, seafood etc and beer for $7 a big bottle of Tiger beer! Satay 60 cents a stick (minimum 10 sticks) and so tasty. Very good and very inexpensive in a city which isn't cheap!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Priced for tourists - be aware,30,4 June 2015,Food quality is good but most of the seafood stalls (for which Newton is known for) charge exorbitant prices because the centre is popular with tourists. It is near Orchard and regularly on the tourist 'must do' list.If you really want good seafood try the East coast seafood centre which has a better ambience and probably similar prices.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive but good atmosphere,40,3 June 2015,"Newton Food Centre also widely known in Singapore as Newton Circus is one of Singapore's more famous hawker centres, it is as popular with tourists as it is with locals. Home to seafood eateries and iconic hawkers like Kwee Heng and Hup Kee fried oyster omelette, While some may find the occasional food tout off-putting, it’s probably the only food centre where you can call ahead to reserve a table with your regular go-to seafood stall and have them attend to you. For beginners, don’t feel obligated to order from the hawker who got you a table, simply decline politely. If you are ordering seafood, watch them weigh it in front of you to avoid a surprise bill. Keep an eye out for the busy lunch crowds, happy family gatherings, and inebriated youngsters starving for some post-clubbing grub. It’s also common to see vendors touting all kinds of food, so walk right on by without making eye contact if you don’t want to be accosted. When you’re here, do order the famous chilli crab and barbecued seafood, and sample a veritable slew of other local delicacies. More than just a hawker centre, the variety of good food and unique atmosphere makes any meal at Newton an experience to remember. This is also a great place to people-watch. It is more expensive than other hawker centres but the atmosphere makes up for it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Organised Chaos,50,2 June 2015,"We went here at about 9:30pm last Thursday night and it was still pretty busy at that time. To get here you catch the MRT to Newton station, take the right hand exit and then turn left out of the station and over the bridge across the road.When you first walk in it can be a bit overwhelming, so I suggest just taking 5 minutes to do a lap of the place and get your bearings. you'll quickly figure out that a lot of the places are selling similar food. We ate at stall 70 (Mrs Tan) and the food was great (was nice to try stingray for the first time!). There is a beer stall next door where you can get some decent priced Tiger Beer and my wife really enjoyed the apple cider too.When dealing with Newton Circus you just need to be prepared to have the touts waving their menu's in your face, each one giving you the quick spiel as you walk past but just keep on walking until you find one you are comfortable with. We really enjoyed the experience and it was good to have a break from the expensive restaurants in the quays. We actually went back for an early lunch a couple of days later at midday on Saturday but most of the stalls were closed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Will give you a feel of the local food ,50,2 June 2015,"We love the newton circus its great food. So much variety, its not a restaurant to be clear but more like tiny restaurants in a food market atmosphere. You go past each one find the meal you like and you find a table and they bring it to you. They also have a variety of drink stalls. We found the food and drink here very affordable. We only paid $15 Singapore for 2 small meals and a small rice (pretty big portions) and $9.00 for beer (very cheap here). I would highly recommend just for the experience"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A foodies delight,40,1 June 2015,"There are so many vendors from which to choose a massive amount of dishes. We had carrot cake, oyster omelette, sweet and sour and fried rice. All of the dishes offered different flavours, were quickly delivered to the table and of a high quality. Although our taxi driver suggested that it was more expensive and mainly pitched at tourists, we still enjoyed the experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A good experience!,40,20 May 2015,"We were recommended to visit Newton Hawker Centre buy a people working at our hotel. After a 20 minute walk, our noses told us we had arrived!We were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived as there were so many options. In the end we had chilli crab and fried rice. It was really yum (and messy)!For a large chilli crab and fried rice for 2 it was around 50 Singapore Dollars. This did feel a bit expensive, but I guess it was crab, and everything else was cheap.Would definitely visit again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Pricey, but fabulous !",50,19 May 2015,"The Hawker Centres are an absolute must for eating out in Singapore, and Newton is our favourite. Located right next to the MRT. Don't expect a cheap meal, but do expect a memorable time with very good fresh food. Take a stroll around the various stalls to check what is on offer, place your order, and then find a seat. You will likely be sharing a table with complete strangers, but that is half the fun. The place gets busy every night, and with good reason. On this latest visit, we opted for Tiger Prawns, with fried rice, and steamed vegetables. The prawns were the size of English kippers (!!) seriously, so we restricted ourselves to 2 each. The stallholder will give you a price for these items before you order so you won't get a nasty surprise at the end of the meal. The prawns weighed in at 200-250 grams each, and cost S$16 each, (about £8 each). Not cheap but a terrific meal in a great location with an amazing ambience. Thoroughly recommended ! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pirate's Seafood,50,18 May 2015,A must visit place for seafood lovers visiting Singapore..... Located in the Famous Newton Hawker Centre is stall No.56
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visited back in the 90's! ,50,9 May 2015,A great food Mecca for foodies!! Must try the real open grilled satay with their own homemade peanut sauce. And there was a Indian guy making the best paratha breads which is like between bread and puff pastry!! Would love to go back again some day!! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome!,50,21 April 2015,"A bucket list eating experience! It's hot, sweaty, busy but the atmosphere and the food are incredible! Three meals, six drinks, £15. Made on the spot, fresh ingredients and right in front of you, there is something for everyone. Plastic tables and chairs, communal sitting areas, your place is marked by putting a packet of hankies (bring your own!) and putting at a table. Filled with local people, queues at each of the stalks, freshly squeezed juices, ice cold Tiger beer, and not a McDonalds or Nandos in sight! Bliss!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food great price,50,12 April 2015,"Must do in Singapore. Try the bbq'd prawns (chilli sambal or garlic both fabulous) from Gina at Jian Fa they are huge and tasty. And delicious satays from numerous stalls,all great. Couple of beers from Thong Lai stall 41 and your set. Yum. Oh both these stalls give table service ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A favourite now a disappointment,30,11 April 2015,"This is our 10th visit to Singapore and about our 8th to Newton. First time was when the stalls were makeshift with dirt floors. All modernised and clean now. We always go to #36 Michael, the stall owner with dyed hair, a different colour each time we visit. Usually he serves our choices (mine always Chilli crab) just perfectly. Not so this time. My crab was quite black, eggs and dead mens fingers still present in sauce. Meat too well cooked, so tough and legs dry. Sauce was just mushy. Everything now served on polystyrene plates, food goes cold quickly. First time ever I've left a lot uneaten. We ordered satay sticks first and they came after husbands main course, which was fried calamari. Looked a good portion on plate, but found much of it was deep fried onion rings.Can't help but think standard may be slipping as resting on good reputation of the past. Will have to think twice about returning on future visits to Singapore, especially when so many other centres are popping up with good food and good value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gotta eat here,40,8 April 2015,"I ate at the pirates seafood, aiming for chilli crab. It was a big, juicy, delicious food. I ordered normal hot one, and it was almost sweet to me. If you're indonesian, 'saos padang' crab is much more tasty n spicy than this. The price is 5sgd/100 g for the crab. A very friendly n hopeful seller.This place is huge, you can find almost ant kinds of food here. Next time i go to sg, i will come here again for different food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, good athmosphere",50,2 April 2015,Most of the time I'm in Singapore I come over at Newton for dinner and I've never been disappointed! Cheap and good food with abundance of variety and the coldest beers in town! It can also be really fun if the stall owners/operators come sit with you! I'll always come back!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoy variety of food here,40,24 March 2015,"Just you get out of Newton MRT station, you will find this eating place. A big complex where on all four sides small stalls sale all kind of food. Local, Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Korien, Thai, Indian .... Soft drinks, beer, and water can be purchased with your food. Clean atmosphere, tasty food. Indian vegetarian food was also available here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap good eats,40,23 March 2015,"Went here for an early lunch. A fair bit was closed but easily enough to make it difficult to choose. We had a spicy stingray, noodle dish, a buttery chicken. Cant remember everything but overall we were stuffed and very good food. The butter chciken was disappointing and we didnt ask the price before receiving the dish and paid far too much so ALWAYS negotiate beforehand if its not written on the board. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,40,9 March 2015,"Access easy enough via MTR (as long as you come out of the station by the right exit!)Good variety of food, the main benefit being that you can order from one person, and he/she sources the food for you, so you do not have to visit loads of stalls.Make sure you pay for your drinks only once, as we had the feeling we had paid for them with the food, only to be presented with another bill!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Okay tasting local food, but all located in one hawker centre",30,27 February 2015,"I visited Newton Hawker Center on 26th Feb and at 730pm, the car park was almost full and the parking attendant was making his rounds and issuing parking fines! Do note, they do not have a gantry system, so have your parking coupons ready!There are a lot of BBQ Seafood stalls in Newton and most of them sell the same stuff. Do note that though they tout and push each shop, every customer has the right to say NO! The touters get commission based on what they sell to you. To avoid getting cheated, pay upon ordering and INSIST so, else you might end up with a 3 digit bill at the end of your meal, with no explanation.Here's a review of the food we shared amongst 6 people.The Ocean BBQ #01-016 We just picked the stall we sat right next too, but I did notice that the stalls facing the inner circle seemed to be more popular. This ocean BBQ, is one of the outside stalls facing the car park.1. Lemon Chicken $15I loved lemon chicken and we ordered this. Expecting to be a thick chicken cutlet, I was surprised to see it served as fried cubed chicken. Some pieces were of the thigh meat, hence more flavourful, some pieces were breast meat and very dry. The sauce itself was decent, very lemony and you can taste the slight blend of honey. But I guess having cubed-sized chicken makes it easier for sharing.2. Sambal Singray $15My friend mentioned that the sambal was nice and it was! It was slightly sweet and for someone like me who doesn't eat spicy. This was the perfect sambal stingray for me! The stingray was meaty and the meat was easily separated from the bones. 3. Sambal SotongA similar sauce from the stingray was stir fried with the sotong, hence making the sotong abit sweet. The sotong tasted fresh and the serving was big enough for the 6 of us to share. Chances is, I might hit this stall up again, the next time I'm here. Definitely in love with their sambal!Bedok 85 Fried Oyster #01-0401. Oyster Omelette $5They were very generous with the oysters, The egg was crispy on the top layer, but on the bottom layer, it was soggy and was very mushy. I didn't quite like it in the end. If you want really good oyster omelette, try Kim Keat at Bradell.2. Carrot Cake White/black $4Even though their sign boards still says the carrot cakes are sold in $3 portions, They have increased their prices. The black had alot more egg and was sweet. The white wasn't crispy and tasted bland. Overall, another upsetting local dishKwang Huat #01-015 My friend was patiently waiting for this stall to open at 745pm! And at 730pm the owners were ready to take orders, but we didn't get our food till about 750pm.1. Hokkien Prawn Mee $5For $5, you get a satisfying plate of prawn mee with a lot of gravy, and 4 big prawns. The gravy is truly tasty and yummy. Although you can tell they did not use any lard, so it's missing that special taste. Some sotong and egg is what you get with the prawn mee, no three-layer pork meat either. I guess this stall is now muslim-friendly. 2. Char Kway Teow This was a rather OK dish at best. I couldn't taste the wok-hei and there were a lot of cockles and no other ingredients, there were like 2 slices of 50 cent coin sized fish cakes.. I do not like cockles, so I found this very upsetting. Char Kway teow to me is my most favourite dish in Singapore but I wouldn't come back here for this.Singa Cafe #01-014 Their sugar juice drinks are $1.50 and can drinks are priced at $1.50. Very reasonable pricingSoursop Juice $2I loved that their soursop juice was full of soursup meat. The drink was served with a plastic spoon, which you will need to scoop up the fruit.For those unknown to the benefits of soursop.Soursop contains a number of natural substances that have biological benefits such as, relieve stomach distress, fever, pain and respiratory problems such as cough and asthma.TKR #01-030 After walking around, we realized the prices were standard for the chicken wings $1.30 and 60cents per satay. We decided to go with TKR as it was a chinese stall, which meant they sold pork satay!1. Pork/chicken/mutton Satay 60 cents eachWe ordered 10 sticks of pork, 10 sticks of chicken and 10 sticks of mutton which added up to $18, and they gave us 5 bowls of satay sauce. The pork satay had alot of fats in them, which for me, I actually enjoyed. For the health conscious, you might want to just take the chicken sticks, which were more tender. The mutton was considerably drier than the chicken and pork, but it didn't have the weird smell. So I was okay with it.2. BBQ Chicken wings $1.30 eachThe chicken wings were pretty good. I enjoyed the crispy roasted skin. The meat was very juicy and I felt that for BBQ chicken wings, these weren't too oily and is a good choice for me! I've had BBQ chicken wings dripping with oil and that's usually the reason why I avoid them.They were presented very nicely on the styrofoam plate. They definitely gave some thought into present"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for those foodies,40,24 February 2015,"I visited here last year after being recommended to go by my cousin living there. We were taken to her favourite stall and the food was delicious. Being of ethnic origin we did get stared at, however because we knew what it was we wanted to eat and acted accordingly, we were not bothered by any other stalls. There were a total of 6 of us in our group and the food was plentiful and reasonably priced. I would definatly reccomend here if you want to try good local dishes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Carrot cake,30,22 February 2015,Awesome carrot cake and pepper crab. Enjoyed the meals with family and friends. Quick service. Wish it was cleaner.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food!!,50,20 February 2015,"I went to Newton Hawkers for an early lunch and found that a lot of the stalls were closed. A lot of the store owners there try to get you to read their menus and hope that you will buy their food, but I went for the Chilli Crab at Modern Grill Seafood.The service there can be quite crass when you place the order, and it takes a little while for the crab to come out (about 15 minutes, despite the fact it wasn't very busy at all), but I really enjoyed it. The mud crab had lots of meat, great flavour and they give you a bowl of lemon water (and a heap of napkins) to wash your hands after. No utensils given, so you have to use your teeth and hands.The whole crab was $45 including the fried man tou (white buns) which came in ten. The whole thing was delicious! You get your hands pretty dirty though. We also got Iced Teh from Syed Ishak Teh Tarik stall, served by a lovely man! The drinks were fantastic. My sister also had prawn mee, which she really enjoyed.A great Hawkers Center, pretty authentic, nice outdoor area, adequetely clean and it has (like many Hawkers Centres) sinks just out the front to wash your hands in. A quick, convenient place to go for food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not like the old place, bit of a rip off",30,14 February 2015,"Last time we were in Singapore we visited the original Newton Circus hawker market. It was great food,great atmosphere and fantastic value for money. The new sanitised version is OK, but comes no where near the original. Food was advertised as very reasonable however when you ask for the bill it has shot up dramatically. We had; small rice, small noodles, large shrimp, chillie shrimp and spicy chicken. We expected about 75 to 80 Singapore dollars, it came in at 120??? No written bill and no explanation . Food is ok but you can eat better and cheaper in the city."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food Food Glorious food!,50,13 February 2015,excellent food and innumerable choices! Right prices and open until late...chilled beer is always awesome
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",NOT AS IT WAS BUT STILL GOOD,40,12 February 2015,"The tourists discovered this place 45 years ago and its still a popular landmark in the Singapore dining scene. I always have the chilli crab from one of the stalls and the grilled prawns , some stir fried veg and I am set. I think the prices have gone from very cheap to really expensive comparatively and it is true you can now get the same thing at other hawker markets for much less . But this is the place to be ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well Known for Tourist,40,10 February 2015,"Newton Hawker Centre has changed over the years and is now the main local hawker eating place for tourist. The car parking has always been a problem and now coaches arrive even bigger problem. The hawker stalls are really packed and as soon as you step inside their staff are showing you menu's showing you what you can eat showing you to tables near their stalls. You can buy almost any local dish; Chinese, Indian, Malay, and it all has that slight Western edge taste for the tourist. Prices are some what higher than the more local hawker centre's so I'd tend to go to them. Years ago there were a lot of cats around but now couldn't see any which was good. We ordered a selection of local dishes which were plentiful and good, the Tiger beer came in an ice bucket and were the large bottles. As you'd expect service was quick, as there were plenty of people waiting for tables."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This place is for tourist,10,28 January 2015,"It suppose to contain alot of local food, but that is for tourists.
And the price is cater for tourists too.
Head for hawker that most local will go, cheaper price but good food, examples are alexandra food market, brickworks market (ACB)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ms Tan @ No.70,40,26 January 2015,"We caught the train to Newton and headed straight to Newton Circus for dinner. It wasn't how I remembered it 24 years ago, then it was packed, busy and cheap. Had a stroll around looking at what was on offer and came across stall No.70. We quickly ordered grilled prawn, sweet & sour chicken, stir fried water spinach and Singapore noodles. A cold tiger beer hit the spot on this steamy Singapore night. Our food arrived and the grilled prawn was so big, enough for 1 person, coated in a homemade chilli & garlic sauce, it was so yum. All our food was delicious and just enough to fill us. Ms Tan was lovely, as soon as she said ""yummy yummy in my tummy"" I knew we had chosen well. Look, like alot of others have said, it's not cheap, but it was good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",PEPPER CRAB!,50,26 January 2015,The concierge at the Sands said this is where Gordon Ramsay ventured for Pepper Mud Crab. Who I am to argue? If was awesome. About $40 bucks and thing was alive 1 minute and then in my belly the next.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Old haunt,40,22 January 2015,"Some years ago we lived very close to this hawker centre and called it our local. On a recent trip to Singapore this was the first place we went to once we had dropped our bags in the hotel. It has changed a little and prices have gone up, but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal of chilli stingray, oyster omelette and fried hokkien prawn mee, washed down with Tiger beer and fresh lime juice. We would have loved to have had more dishes but there was only two of us......Yum!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really good food,50,15 January 2015,"Try the soft chilli crab! Amazing. Loved the food. Upon arrival can be a bit annoying with vendors trying to push their menu's onto them. Just ignore them and quickly find a suitable stall to buy from and once you have ordered, everyone ignores you pretty quickly. It's lovely to sit outside at night. Try the juice place and the natural cane sugar drink, delicious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit whilst in singapore for local seafood,50,12 January 2015,"This place is a must visit whilst in singapore, although slightly touristy now as meals are generally around $6-10 where your local hawker stands are closer to $3-5 per meal, it makes for a cleaner and nice environment from which to enjoy your food.The stall holder will shove menu's in your face as you walk past but this is Asia so you should expect this and be comfortable to just wave your hand and say no thank you. This is part of the atmosphere and I wouldn't have it any other way.A must try is the singapore Chilli Crab which will set you back around $35-$40 for a decent size crab and the fried buns $5 which are great for dipping into the sauce.Also of pretty good quality is the satay chicken sticks which are around $0.60-$0.70 each and come with home made satay sauce with actual crushed up nuts in it. This is an easy to eat family favourite, I would suggest that you need around 10 sticks per head to call this a meal or if it's a snack / entree then go for a mixed plate of them so you can enjoy the different types of meat.Another interesting dish that you won't find in too many other places is the stingray, which is extremely tasty."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grab your table first!,40,9 January 2015,"You MUST visit Newton Circus when you go to Singapore. It's an experience you'll get nowhere else in the world. Hundreds of stalls selling every imaginable food at reasonable (for tourists) prices. The atmosphere is amazing and you'll not be disappointed by the quality or choice of food. The only advice I can give is to go in pairs (at least), walk round first to see what you fancy eating, then one of you grab a table while the other orders from the stalls. This way, you'll not be looking for somewhere to site when you food is ready."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, location and atmosphere!!!",40,9 January 2015,"I am not an expert on Hawker Centres like this but when three of us visited this centre for dinner during our stay in Singapore we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had visited this particular centre about 6 years ago and think it has improved considerably.We had a mixture of seafood dishes of crab, prawns and octopus and all were perfectly cooked and totally enjoyable at a price that we considered reasonable. No 82 was the stall we used and they were good and helpful. The market was clean and maintained that way while we were there.It was also a pleasant experience due to the fact that while the various stall holders touted for your business they were not overly pushy as you might expected from these places. When visiting Singapore in the future will happily pay this place a visit again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check price before ordering,40,31 December 2014,"Even as a local, I seldom come here to dine as its too touristy and expensive. You can get better quality at cheaper price elsewhere.But the centralized location and atmosphere is good, windy and spacious. Do take note of menu priced as $X/100 grams. These are usually those that rip you off. Or just make sure you ask and confirm the pricing before ordering. Now I see most of the stalls have changed the menu to a fixed pricing. What I've order:Sambal kangkong, fried honey baby squids, sambal stingray, satay, sugar cane juice, fried carrot cake, cereal prawns - total bill of approximately SGD$85 for two pax. Enjoy Singapore! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good seafood and hawker centre,40,5 December 2014,Good seafood and close to my hotel. Price is a bit hiked up due to it being a tourist hotspot nowadays. Stalls are plenty but most are selling same or similar items. Pick any stall and wont be dissapointed. Tips: walk back to Orchard was nice and so do-able.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Buzzing atmosphere,50,4 December 2014,"We made a point of returning to this location because we love the night atmosphere and buzz of activity. This is an open air market with many eating stalls and tables ands chairs in the middle. there is something food wise for all tastes, even a vegetarian like myself. The prices are so cheap, it's crazy. No need to worry about the standard of the food, all good. Just a short train ride to get there. Everyone should experience this once while in singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One stop for all,40,2 December 2014,"Especially for those who are in Singapore on an extremely tight schedule, Newton has always been the place to grab most of the local cuisines at one go. It can be overwhelming at times but I would recommend my friends to venture a little, look at what people order and order the same if it attracts you. Not overly pricey, one can easily be filled up with less than SGD$10 going for one dish items like Ba Chor Mee Pok, Chicken rice, Fried Hokkien mee. But go big a little and try the Sting Ray, my favourite (I always ask for chilli on the side)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Love the food!,40,10 November 2014,"why would anyone else go to a hawker center if the food is not good? the food there is great, but it's a bit dark and could use a bit more lighting"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Singaporean Chilli Crab @ Stall 31,50,8 November 2014,"We went there for lunch. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawns, fried rice and fried buns which came to a total of SGD$65. Food was delicious. Very reasonable price compared to big restaurants which charge premium price (Over SGD$200 for the same meal).Definitely worth a try!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overwhelming ,30,1 November 2014,"Went for dinner one night on the recommendations of friends. It's outdoors and even at night is hot! You walk in and it is overwhelming there are so many food places!!! The second you sit down you are swamped with people giving you menus telling you to eat at their food stand which we didn't like, we wanted to walk around and browse before we chose but it was almost impossible with people heckling you!! The boys decided on Chilli crab, nasi goreng and chicken and rice which was amazing and not expensive compared to home! Chilli is put on everything so make sure you make it very clear if you don't want it, they won't remake a dish or give a refund! At least the whole coconuts with straws were a great respite from the heat. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the Seafood Scams,10,26 October 2014,"If you are not careful you will be ripped off here by unscrupulous seafood stall holders. The one who took us for a ride was from Stall 23, Takara Grilled Seafood.It works like this: - Friendly host escorts you to a table and brings out his colourful menu. Most of the prices on the menu are reasonable. - He strongly recommends the grilled prawns, listed at $8 per 100 grams, and suggests two each is about right. You agree because it is a marketplace and everything else looks reasonable. - The prawns come, they are OK. - As soon as you finish them, he comes and whisks the platter away. So no evidence!! - When the bill comes, your prawns cost about $20 each (i.e. 250 grams), and you have no way of disproving it.Unfortunately this is one of those episodes where the mistake we made was trusting a friendly local person."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Real Atmosphere,50,23 October 2014,"We love Newton Circus, and ate here 3 nights out of a 5 night stay. The satay sticks and chicken wings from stall number 30 are delicious. Add a nice cold beer or juice from Michaels at number 29 a beautiful balmy night and what more could you want?? This is to me what a hawker centre should be and I love the atmosphere and vibe. This is something we just cannot get back home. I think the prices are reasonable. The only down side is some of the more aggressive touts, but just tell them politely to go away and that you will get your own table. Then you can freely look at all of the stalls. There is a good variety of food available. Can't wait to return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Rip Off/ Below Average Food,10,23 October 2014,"Unfortunately what could be a very pleasant outdoor-eating experience is ruined by the vendors. Expect to be hassled by various touts and then to be ripped off by them or a stall holder. If you choose anything with a marked price it is generally ok - although prices are no cheaper than restaurants - it is NOT street food prices. But if you choose anything by weight you will be ripped off big time. Go anywhere for street food, such as Adam Road, which is quite nearby. For seafood, head to the East Coast Seafood Centre.But avoid Newton Circus. Amazed the government haven't dome more to clean up the brazen thieves that run this place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",stall 70 delight seafood - excellent food and great sell,50,12 October 2014,"Was advised to try this place via family friend was not disappointed. Overall the food stalls had a good variety and choice but a few of the hawkers were a bit in your face. After wandering around to get the overall flavour we stumbled on stall 70. Were met by Ms Tan Kwee Gek who charmed us with her sales pitch. After telling us the menu we said we would check out some more stalls but would likely be back. Needless to say we were. We had outstanding tiger prawns with chilli and garlic, fried rice, crispy baby squid and complementary Asian greens The food was great with a beautiful chilli zing, the prawns whilst not cheap were simply to die for. The sales pitch was very good but the food more than lived up to it and actually outshone it. Be sure to take your business card as the lovely lady collects them and is very pleased to show you recommendations from previous clients. If you try the Newton Hawkers centre check out stall 70 and i trust you enjoy as much as wedid."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Rip off,10,8 October 2014,Don't eat here. Many years ago it was affordable and the food was reasonable but now it's a rip off. Last night we had a small chili crab and a plate of vegetarian noodles together with a bottle of water and a coconut juice and it came to $60 for street food. Especially stay away from the lady at stall 46. there are many other places in Singapore worth spending your money at.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average to below average food,30,6 October 2014,"The centre has a large variety of local cuisine - hawker food and seafood. However the food is slightly over priced compared with other hawker centres, and locals say the reason is due to tourists who frequent the place. We have tried a few different stalls and unfortunately, have not found any stall that provides really good-tasting food. Most food centres in the shopping malls provide better tasting food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with the locals here!,40,29 September 2014,"We just had a delicious family lunch here amongst the locals of Singapore and I highly recommend you do that if in town. The closest MRT station is Newton and then a short walk from there. Here is what you do: you look around the whole centre and check out what meal you would like to eat, then you go back to the shop and order from the photo (small, medium or large), they range from $6 to $24 for a plate of cereal prawns, they are yummy, just make sure you ask to peel them first. The shop owner remembers you,tell them where you care sitting and then they bring the food to your table and you pay. We chose Mr Tan from Heng Heng BBQ stall 31 and he is very humble, calm and explains all the dishes without being pushy so I recommend if you want to eat at peace and enjoy local food, go to him. We also enjoyed a cold beer as the beer is very conducive and a good way to digest the food too. There are so many dishes to choose from, we picked the green veggies, cha keow tow, pad tai, cereal prawns and the satays.A tip: take a bacterial gel for your hands and some napkins or tissues. Choose any table under a fan and enjoy!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good eats,40,29 September 2014,"If you aren't a local then be ready to be bombarded with hawker stand owners asking you to eat at their stand. We came for chili crab and we got a feast! We paid about 80 dollars for crab, fried rice and two jumbo shrimps. Not sure if that's cheap... But it was good! We ate at hawker stand 46. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nicely Different, but be cautious over selling but stall owners.",40,23 September 2014,"In all my years of traveling to Singapore I have never been to a Hawker Centre. It's cheap eating that resembles a food court in an American Mall. I wish I had know about these before, as they could have saved me a whole lot of time and money. A huge variety of foods, that is served quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately we got duped into buying large prawns which were hugely expensive, so make sure you keep track of what you have ordered and the price you ordered it at. I would defiantly go back, time, and time again, but obviously have learned from my previous mistake. Great atmosphere, with locals, expats, and tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tips for a great experience despite the daunting setup,30,19 September 2014,"Went to the Newton (circus) food hawker centre.Pro's: Great atmosphere, lots of stalls to choose from, great satays and noodles, reasonable pricesCon's: Many touters for seats infront of there stalls to infer to eat from them. Prices reasonable but not cheap. If new to this it can be daunting of which stall to choose and confronting with the touting and some being pushy.Recommendations: Less hectic seating on the perimter than inside the middle plus you get any breeze/air. Less touting on the perimter.Try to choose a stall with a hygiene symbol of AWe were lucky that we sat and got advice from a local family.Our best food choices were the malaysian satays from #22 best satay stall on an end of the inside perimeter."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Terrible, find another hawker centre",10,13 September 2014,"We went here with family and the atmosphere and the sellers where unfriendly and pushy.
We settled for pretty bad and overprised laksa and not good at all meatballs.
Satay and Beer where OK
This place have no soul..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Highly Recommended - Satay Sedap (Stall # 67),50,5 September 2014,"Best satays around. At Newton Hawker Centre there a many stalls that offer chicken, beef, and lamb satays, and I've tried most. But Satay Sedap (#67) is the best."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Food ok , and not as cheap as you would expect",30,5 September 2014,"The food is ok and more expensive that you would think, due to the vicinity and the amounts of tourist. However the experience is still worthwhile if you enjoy experiencing something different. A different style of life in a different culture. I enjoy the outside environment and the smells floating around the air. However, if you don't like to sweat and eat at the same time then this is not for you."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still up to standard,40,3 September 2014,"Returning after 30 years the place still has it's magicThe environment and food greatAs you walk in, you are plagued by hawkers trying to entice you to theirs tall.don't take the first choice, look around, we found stall 70 good value, , however they are all good value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Horrible atmosphere,10,28 August 2014,"Came back to Singapore after 20 years when I used to live across the street from Newton Circus. They have seriously destroyed everything that this hawker centre was. Not only is it unrecognizable, but the vendors are pushy. The atmosphere is stressful and uninviting. Go to Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown for a real hawker experience. Don't get trapped in to Newton Circus. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",VFM!,40,28 August 2014,VALUE FOR MONEY! Spoilt for choice. The street food is safe n hygienic. Cool place to catch up with friends for an informal eve of unashamed gluttony
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Try the bloody mutton soup,40,26 August 2014,"In Malaysia, we also have mutton soup but in this stall, the soup is red in colour and looks kinda creepy but damn it taste so good! There are also a lot varieties there such as korean, western, malaq and many more. Moreover it is very cheap so it's a good place to go if you lose a bet and had to treat your friends."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,40,8 August 2014,great place to visit for authentic Singaporean cuisine and very cheap! All cooked fresh for you ...lots of locals eat there too so that's a good sign.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This place is great! So cheap and great food.,50,7 August 2014,"We went here with friends who are living in Singapore and took us here. Wow, the atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious, tasty and cheap. Make sure you try the stingray and carrot cake (not not actual carrot cake but made with eggs, some sort of dumpling thing, not sure what else but yum). It's authentic, local foods, service is excellent. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A 48 hour experience ,20,6 August 2014,"We visited newton circus as one of our colleagues wanted to see what had changed in 25 yrs. his last visit Was a buzzy , lively place and I thought the food was great , however three others had squid and suffered very badly the next day , I'd still go back as I had a great meal but disappointing three people were ill "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",very satisfying dinner,40,3 August 2014,"My boyfriend's favorite food court when he works here. Lots of choices from seafood to noodles to indian cuisine. We had a small potion sting ray ($12), small black pepper crab ($32), a noodle ($10), indian pancake ($4), a beer and a coconut ($11). the place is outdoor. It's a bit smoky and hot, but would like to go back for the food again!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,50,1 August 2014,Instead of eating at the well overpriced hotel restaurants I would go to Newton Circus_ a food hawker - as they are called locally. The variety of foods amazing! The prices range from cheap to reasonable. The Hawkers in Singapore are well regulated and licensed. Sanitation and cleaniness are not a problem through frequent inspection. I liked the atmosphere as well.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere,40,30 July 2014,"Nice open place with several options of food.
Big tables to share with other people.
I came on a Wednesday night and it's quite full of people.
Prices are a bit expensive comparing to similar food courts."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satisfied,40,23 July 2014,"After skimming through several mixed reviews, i decided to go and experience Newton food center despite having my local friend said it's a ""tourist trap"".Once i'm there i was greeted by a throng of people. Luckily we got our seats after 5 minutes roaming around. We had chili stingray from the first stall at the entrance, bbq sotong at the stall that has a red LED, and oyster omelette from stall 28 (people say its the best).Price wise there might be cheaper hawker food centers but this one might be one of the most convenient (since its near the CBD), at least for tourists, anyway"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,50,21 July 2014,we just love the assortment of food offered here. great place for dinner hang out after a day's walking tours
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent despite the mixed reviews,40,20 July 2014,"Newtons was located just 2 mins walk from our holiday apartment (Orchard Scott's Residence), having read the mixed reviews on trip advisor we decided to give it a try on our first night in Singapore. The concept is really simple, choose a numbered table then order food from the many different stalls and have it delivered to that table number. The food was cheap, fresh and delicious. The first night we ate ""inside"" surrounded by the stalls, from then on we chose to sit outside close to the car park. The food was so good and the choices so varied we ended up eating from here most nights. Felt very happy to send our children to order for themselves, the stall holders got to know us and were very friendly. Paying at the table means your food is delivered promptly. Ask for cold drinks otherwise they may not be. Fresh fruit chopped to order was a lovely way to finish our meals. Try the sambal stingray, prawn noodle soup, Indian palace, and anything from the outside Thai stall. Despite the number of reviews stating you are hassled at your table we never found this to be the case. There was a polite one armed man selling wet wipe packs who stopped at each table but he was never rude and in fact we began to rely on him being there so we could buy off him. Cheap, cheerful and a great experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","A ""must do"" in Singapore",50,15 July 2014,"Make sure you arrive early to bag a seat at this fabulous food market. Great fun to watch the locals collecting their takeaways for dinner! Each cabin prepares their own speciality and you just choose whatever takes your fancy. The food and drinks are fresh, plentiful an excellent value. You really are spoilt for choice. Everything from fresh seafood, satays, salads, exotic fruits and freshly made drinks."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",worst hawker centre in Singapore,10,12 July 2014,"Really dislike this hawker center. One visit was enough for me, I won’t give it a second chance. There are so many amazingly wonderful hawker centers in Singapore, why anyone goes to Newton Circus is beyond my comprehension. You get accosted with pesky hagglers the second you arrive, the tables have warnings about not ordering from the individuals haggling you but to order directly at the stall instead. This sort of says it all. Newton Circus is a generally unpleasant place because of these people. Lau Pa Sat satay evenings has a slight bit of this same scene but they leave you alone after one attempt, and the overall vibe is enjoyable and hectic and manageable. At Newton Circus, there is nothing enjoyable at all about the persistent hecklers who are there, it feels like, to exploit the tourist element. As to the quality of the food, I can’t even comment because I couldn’t wait to leave. Thankfully I have tons of other fantastic choices for hawker food, I am not missing anything by opting out of this one."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",marja63,50,9 July 2014,"Food is good and cheap.
You can see lizards and enjoy local envirement.
It`s very easy to get here by tube.
Hawker centre is just beside the MRT station."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",really for locals,30,2 July 2014," Very different to 15 years ago when it was relaxed and cheap food. This time it felt hustled. Rushed to a table and seemingly forced to order in a rush. The food was very expensive and average quality. We got poor value because we looked like tourists, which is a bad thing here now."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun and so much to choose,40,29 June 2014,"We met up with some friends who live in singapore for dinner and they took us here, it was amazing we arrived and a man found a table for the four of us, once establishing what we ate our mate ordered some tiger beers with glasses and ice and then went off to order our food coming back to the table we sat and talked then all of a sudden food started appearing at our table from all the different stalls she went to, it was amazing and so much fun."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",So Much to Choose From,40,24 June 2014,"What a concept... how good would it be to have one of these at home!
Such a variety of food and at a very reasonable price.
People are so friendly and willing to prepare your food exactly how you would like..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety,40,21 June 2014,"A must visit when in Singapore. Tried the garlic prawns, Singapore chilli crab, satay, fried rice and the food was spectacular."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",stall 74/76 for food and stall 75 for drink,40,15 June 2014,great chili crab and the girl who was waiting on us was super friendly and non pushy. she actually spent time talking with us.the lady from stall 75 selling drinks was super cute and kept giving us napkins to keep clean.the market itself was super busy and lots of people trying to get your attention.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","try stall 50 .good ,friendly service.affordable n fresh seafood",40,10 June 2014,"i was there with a group of 6 friends. had bbq squids,stingray,tiger prawns at $15 each.very fresh indeed.huge ones.total bill $200 plus.onlyi bypassed stall 46..due to the negative review..but was lucky i settled on stall 50.met alan,the friendly macho guy holding the menu. i am now his regular. bringing my overseas friends/clients often to support him."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid Stall 46 Jian Ha Seafood BBQ - major rip off.,20,6 June 2014,"The hawker centre was busy on a wet Friday night and had limited 'free seating' as most tables were for diners of a certain stall. 46 said we could order from other places so that suited our group. We had no complaints about the food: string ray, chili crab, 4 prawns and fried rice. The menu indicated prices but we were not asked or advised to the reality. $8.00 per 100 g it said but they claimed $80 for 4 prawns- $20 a prawn!!! Served with plastic plates and forks. I'm sure they were not over 200 g per prawn. It's too hard when they have been eaten. We asked for a small serve of the sting ray but were charged for the large. We also asked for a small crab and that was $40. That didn't seem too bad but to hand over $60 per head for a meal on plastic plates, wet ground and tables seemed a real rip off. Tourists beware. Ask for proof and cost. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious chilly crab!,40,4 June 2014,It was a little confusing at first where to eat but by walking around and seeing which places appeared to be busier than others we managed to find a seafood place.It was an experience to 'choose' our crab and then have it delivered to us! The chill crab was delicious; the soup was just right in consistency and chilliness and was complimented by some fried rice. We then had some traditional tea to end our lovely meal. We did find it value for money because we saw chilli crab advertised outside the centre and it was a lot more expensive than what we paid for.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food..,40,31 May 2014,"Some Singaporean friends warned me that is is a tourist attraction and may be a tourist trap, but I went to try it anyway. Read some reviews from TA that booth no A1 is an honest vendor, and tried Fried Rice from A1. Huge portion of fried rice (medium size) S$ 8, and I just managed to ate 1/2, took the rest away. I guess small portion (S$ 5) should be enough.Tried Omellete Oyster from other booth but this this tasted so-so, as the oyster is still 'wet' and felt slightly undercooked. Didn't manage to try Ah-Heng carrot cake as it was closed. There were some touts, but you can just say no politely and they were not pushy. Go to this place if you want to try many varieties of Singapore food, the price is fair as many starts from S$ 5."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Chilly Crabs!,40,31 May 2014,"We went there for chilly crabs and we were so glad we did ! The seafood is pretty pricey, so don't forget to ask how much it cost and confirm the price as some of the hawkers will increase the price to take advantage of the tourists. The table next to us had some locals were very kindly ordered and negotiated the cost for us...we were very thankful for their assistance. Enjoy your chilly crabs with fresh young coconut juice....refreshing! We will go back on our next visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very special place - don't miss it,40,20 May 2014,"We went there on my husbands business trip to Singapore - I went with him and we combined it with a holiday. One evening we had to go to dinner with his company, and they decided that I had to see this very typical Singapore place with all the different things to eat. We ordered a lot of different food and shared it. I recommend this place - and you'll find your favorite food in one of all the small shops."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun and tasty,40,18 May 2014,"A friend of mine took me here when I last visited. The set up is fun - you can work your way around trying different dishes from different food stalls, or just chill out at by one stall. A few bottles of Tiger and you're away. Great atmosphere and a great thing to do for an evening during a visit to Singapore. These hawker stall areas are in a number of areas I think, it is just that this is the particular one I went to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be Warned,10,5 May 2014,"2 years ago we were warned not to go to Newton Hawker Centre as it is a tourist trap. Previous years we had fantastic chilly crab. On the previous trip we could not go to the centre so we went this time. The chilly crab was a watered down tomato paste with a little chilly taste. The crab we chose was also not the same crab when it arrived. Previous years you got a receipt when you ordered your food and you paid straight away. Not this time. When we got the bill, they increased the amount. When we queried it, they got very aggressive. We refused to pay the amount. In the one corner of our table was a telephone no you phone if you feel done in. I started to phone that no and only then they started to change their attitude. We paid a lesser amount but still more than we were supposed to pay. BE WARNED and stay away. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always worth a visit,50,5 May 2014,"I recently returned from a three week stay in Singapore and ate at Newton Food Centre four times. On two occasions I ate at Ms Tan' (Stall 70) - I had some fabulous huge butter prawns on one occasion and the fabulous black pepper crab on another. Together with some greens and some rice it came to around 40 SGD each time. If you want cheaper then there are many stalls doing Char Kwai Teow etc for 7 or so SDG. I also had a couple of beers from a stall nearby which must be one of the cheapest on the island at 7.5 SGD for a bigger 660ml bottle of tiger. On the other two occasions I ate at the Indian (around stall 40 I think) and had a fabulous keema each time. Again washed down with a big bottle of Tiger. Yes, there are people trying to tempt you as you walk in the entrance but this is Singapore so it is hardly in your face! If you are a new comer I suggest walking around grabbing a table (under cover if rain is in the offing) then ordering a beer. Each of your party can then choose where they would like to eat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent authentic food,40,29 April 2014,"Food at Newton was great, very fresh, cheap and plenty of it. There is seating in the open and undercover and is great for families with plenty of room for the kids to run around. We would recommend the famous chilli crab from Tay at Takara Grilled Seafood, Stall 74."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't be shy!,50,22 April 2014,"We were recommended this by a taxi driver who we asked to take us to East Coast. 15 minutes later with a list of what to ask for and how to ask we were dropped off and entered the centre. Its an outdoor hexagon shaped area with seating in the middle and under cover. Probably around 30 restaurants selling seafood and satay etc. We had the chilli crab 38 Singapore dollars and BBQ stingray 18 dollars which was a first and absolutely delicious. Tiger beer must be the cheapest in town 7 dollars for a big bottle. You eat of plastic plates with plastic cutlery, but its an experience that makes a difference and you should try as an alternative or as well as the big seafood places. You won't be sorry. We went as a family of 4 including 5 and 2 year olds and all had a great time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the prawns!,30,20 April 2014,"My husband and I decided to go to Newtons Circus for local cheap food for dinner while in Singapore tonight. I had a $5 meal, and he decided to have the garlic prawns recommended by a nice little old lady saying ""hmm yum yum"". On presentation it looked fantastic. Looked more like lobster than prawns. Four of them. When it came to paying we thought she was saying $16 for prawns and fried rice. Turns out it was $16 for EACH prawn making a grand total of $64!!!!!!! Apparently they go by weight......so when ordering garlic prawns (yum yum), ask the price FIRST! Not the cheapest meal ever :/"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli crab from Mrs Tan,40,18 April 2014,"We have been to Newton Circus many times and it never fails to disappoint. It is always clean and bustling with locals and tourists (although seems to be more locals which must be a good sign of the quality). This time (March 2014) we had chilli crab, Asian greens and Mee Goreng noodles from Mrs Tan in shop 70. Delicious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food Court with Nice Food,40,16 April 2014,"When Am in Singapore always indent to visit Newton food court, its one my best choice for Seafood and drinks. Chili or Pepper crab is my first choice, Satay and oyster omelette are my another choice. I love to eat... Yummy foods. Please visit once you be there in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a miss if you are extra sensitive to strong smells,30,13 April 2014,"For vegetarians, it is a worst place to go. It smells like hell and I eat non-veg stuff pretty frequently, and still I couldn't stand the smells. The look and feel is of course, third world and not clean as per Singapore standards. If you want a cheap eat and can stand smells, go for it. Otherwise, skip it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Cheaper Eats in Singapore,40,13 April 2014,"Ah Newton Center after doing the more expensive tourist for show restaurants on one of the Quay's, Newtons is the place to go for good eating at a reasonable cost. Nothing fancy here just good food and cold beers that you can afford."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good but overrated,30,5 April 2014,"There are so many stalls to choose from so you have to look around to make sure you pick the right one. After you order and pay, the food will be delivered to your table (you have to get a table first and note down the table no.) Food here is OK so-so but what you get is the variety and the experience of being in a hawker-centre environment. Plus it's cheap! Worth a visit."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Food Experience,40,30 March 2014,"You have to try a hawkers market when in Singapore. Take your time to look around, and then let one of the ""hawkers"" help you out. Portions are generous, and going from a small to medium raises the price a lot. We ordered too much for three of us, and had to leave a lot on the table. ""The Pirate's Table"" served a very tasty crispy squid dish -- dinner candy! Get some vegetables -- they are delicious. You eat outdoors at concrete tables and off of paper plates. Bring your own napkins and enjoy an Erdinger beer with your dinner. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What a taxi driver would recommend,30,30 March 2014,"9 out of 10 times when I hop on a taxi and ask the driver to bring me to a hawker centre, they would recommend Newton Circus. Later I found out why from my Singaporean friends - (i) for tourists, this place can't go too wrong - it is big, with different varieties of food; and (ii) the driver can always pick up someone from there. It's actually not bad, but the food is more expensive than other hawker centres, and especially for seafood, the menu has no fixed price and if you're not a local, you'll certainly be ripped off. There are a lot of local hawker centres. You just need to ask your Singaporean friends, not taxi drivers."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, excellent seating area & open past 10 pm",50,30 March 2014,"We ate at Maxwell in Chinatown, Tekka in Little lndia, but Newton was my favouite. The eating area is larger, there were sinks for washing your hands and so much variety. We had excellent Indian food, Malay, Chinese soup and juices (we were a group of 7). Luckily it was also still hopping when we arrived at 10 pm from our transfer from Malaysia. Strongly recommended. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local delights,50,18 March 2014,Show my Scottish friends some local delights. They seem to enjoy the BBQ Stink Ray a lots. Not to forget the Tiger Beers. Will definitely be back here for more seafood and beers.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a go!,40,17 March 2014,"This place is amazing - if a little touristy. You have to give it a go! Lots and lots of stalls serving everything from fish dishes, curries, to milky tea and ice- cream. Grab a table, get a number, choose from as many stalls as you wish and the food will be brought to your stone table. Everything is outside and the atmosphere is fantastic. Really good fun."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not a good place for hawker food,20,17 March 2014,"Same food everywhere, and not impressive. They are just not delicious. Good thing about Singapore hawker centres are they are very clean, but I dislike them using many non-recyclable materials, which in long term it is bad for the environment."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great casual atmosphere,40,14 March 2014,"They are a little pushy, just take your time deciding what you want.
Had the following and it was all great
Stingray with bbq sauce
Mi Goreng
Singaporean Chili Crab
Chicken and beef satays
Chicken Wings"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touristy but still okay,40,1 March 2014,Order the fried shrimp with egg floss & barbeque chicken wings - they are nicely done in this place. We were lucky that it was a nice cool night but don't go there during rainy season.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good tasty food at a good price,40,25 February 2014,"Ate here twice. All the food was tasty. (Chilli Stingray not our favourite but we gave it a go). Lots of different choices, nice place to sit and easy to get to. (Take red line train to Newton and follow the signs). Prices were quite reasonable. I would recommend the indian in the corner. (garlic naan and masala curry was spicy and delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience!,40,22 February 2014,"This was recommended to us and we were greatly relieved to find that the taxi driver knew where it was. He gave us advice, which we heeded, on eating at one of the outer layer of stalls. We talked to locals and visitors, asking them what they were eating, what they recommended etc and ordered some dishes from different stalls to share. They were all freshly cooked and very tasty. The value for money was incredible , the atmosphere was great as was the opportunity to talk to lots of different people about the food that they liked and we enjoyed it so much, we returned to sample more on a second night!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Must Stop In Singapore,40,20 February 2014,Had a great time at this place. Too many choices and lots of repetition from food stall to food stall but the food is local and incredible. You've got to try the chili crab and giant prawns. Wow! Simply incredible.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best fish head curry,30,15 February 2014,This was on my first day in Singapore - went there due to a recommendation and ordered the fish head curry because she never lets me down. Fabulous!!!!!The only downside was that when we went it was almost empty. Granted it was a Sunday around noon - I didn't think ahead about the time of day. It would have been nice to see it busy with all the venders open.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Try the BBQ stingray!,40,5 February 2014,A friend took us here for BBQ stingray. It came with a spicy sauce but was delicious. We rounded it out with fried rice and green vegetables. You'll be greeted upon entry by a hawker who will direct you to their stall tables but you can buy from anyone.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Improved!,40,4 February 2014,"I used to go to Newton Circus when it was a hawker centre in the middle of a roundabout. It was great! Then they moved it to the 'sanitized' permanent location it is in now and I felt it was a tourist trap of the worst possible type. I had avoided it for years and the then took someone who was in Singapor efor the first time there so they could see it...it was all I feared. But this visit was different - greatly improved - local folk as well as tourists (always a good sign). The food was excellent, touts trying to get you into their particular stalls wer enot too agressive so walk round at leats once and dont forget there is an 'outside row' as well"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Crab,50,2 February 2014,Fantastic place to dine along with locals. There are several shops with the similar menu. Chilli crab is very tasty. Bargaining is essential especially for crab dishes. Bill for 2 with drinks ~50SGD
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Overpriced, but maybe worth the experience",30,24 January 2014,"As others have said, the food is not particularly a good value, and we seem to have gotten mild food poisoning. This in a city where it is very hard to find bad food. However, the experience of haggling for food and then sitting outside while sharing long tables with locals and visitors alike might be to your liking. We found it an interesting experience but will not return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great experience,40,19 January 2014,"Met up with friends for a meal on a warm December evening. Warned beforehand that it was very touristy but the majority of people eating looked like locals. Presented with a laminated menu with pictures of the dishes, chose garlic prawns which were enormous and delicious, beef in black pepper sauce - delicious, chicken murtabak - brilliant and fried rice. Complete with beers came to less than £15 per head. Very good value and an interesting experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy yummy in my tummy!,50,15 January 2014,"Delicious authentic food, true delicious fast food! Read all the tips and reviews before and felt ready to order appropriately when we went with our 2 kids. Was advised by a stall owner not to walk around and haggle over price, had also read this before. Headed straight to Mrs Tan at stall 70. What a gem. Ordered plenty under her recommendation but not ridiculous. Absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere. Going back tomorrow. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Severe food poisoning from chilli crab,10,14 January 2014,"We got into Singapore from Australia as a stop over on the way to London and decided to sample the 'must-do' things in Singapore on our short visit. We had heard that sampling the chilli crab from one of the bigger hawker centres is well worth it, so we asked our concierge which is the best place, and were advised to try Newton, as another popular centre is undergoing refurbishment.We arrived and were pleasantly surprised that the ""aggressive selling"" that we had been warned about was not the case - apparently there has been a crackdown on this. People will encourage you, gently, to read their menu, but to be honest, I was expecting and almost disappointed to not have to engage in friendly banter and got the feeling the stall owners were holding back due to the new rules.We walked around for 20 minutes and eventually selected a stall, spoke with the owner and ordered the crab. It was ok (we have high standards), and we finished it, paid and left feeling happy. The middle of the night saw an end to that! I have never been so ill, and my wife was almost as bad. I won't bore you with the gory details but needless to say we were violently ill for 2 days with acute gastroenteritis, and almost unable to get our flight to London. We saw a doctor and I was close to being admitted to hospital due to dangerous dehydration (what a nightmare that would have been!).In short, be very careful before deciding to eat here. It's worth seeing one of the markets, but maybe better to get a sealed, commercially produced drink from one of the vendors rather than risk what we went through - it was just awful and ruined our trip to Singapore, as we spent the entire time running between bed and bathroom.As an aside, we stayed in the Mandarin Oriental, who could not have been better. Apart from it being a stunning hotel, the staff went out of their way to assist us during our illness, and gave us a late checkout of 8pm on the day of departure so we could go straight from bed to the airport. I look forward to going back to Singapore, and staying in the Mandarin Oriental again, but will most likely give the hawker centres a miss next time!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food for cheap,40,11 January 2014,You can get good and local food but there.It has probably more than a hundred food stalls there so you have a lot to choose from.But dont make the same mistake as us and go there for lunch. A lot of the stalls will still be closed by then since people go therer for dinner.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced but not too bad,40,10 January 2014,"This hawker centre seems pretty famous, especially among tourists. At dinnertime, maybe 50% of the customers are Caucasian. The food is highly varied from seafood to cuisines of all different cultures, but the price is probably almost double that you would find in other hawker centres. I've had some pretty terrible seafood there, and my Singaporean friends tell me that the seafood there is not particularly good but worth a try I guess. The non-seafood dishes I've had there are very good through, and the difference of a few dollars I'm not too fussed over. Overall definitely worth a try."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Some great stalls, if they were open.",30,6 January 2014,"We visited Newton Hawker Centre around 2.30pm on afternoon for a late-ish lunch. We arrived in the pouring rain to unfortunately find about 60% of the 'stalls' closed for business. We did however manage to find some hianese chicken as well as some fresh indian food, both which were very tasty and resonably priced. In saying this, prices were no substanically cheaper than some seemingly more 'upmakret' offerings in ION Orchard etc, however we understand the food at Newton was probably more authentic and more true to the Hawker experience.Was the food good? Yes. Was the value and atmosphere amazing? Not really. Would it have been better if all the stores were open? For sure.Would drop back in if passing by but would definately check out some other Hawker Centres first."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",good value for money,40,5 January 2014,"plenty of stalls to choose from. don't get intimidated by those who approach you. you can sit anywhere and order from anywhere. must try oyster omelet, stingray (tastes like tuna), chili crab, bakuteh, well almost everything is good!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive ,30,30 December 2013,"Newton hawker centre is definitely worth a look, & the food was good without being exceptional, we had stingray, 2 king prawns, sweet & sour chicken, 9 chicken wings, seafood fried rice & 4 tiger beers.Total cost $160.00, & that was after arguing with the vender & getting a $10 discount. We won't be back @ those prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Frozen beer,50,16 December 2013,When you go for a hawker style diner. you wont expect to get good service usually hawkers just give u want u ask for and mind their own business not here. when asked for a cold beer they gave me frozen beer which is extremely amazing to have at this warm climate at $7 for 640ml... who wants to leave..... the food all around is all great. though they have their sections cut out each respective stall has its own area.. i go here every month a universal place for every occasion..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",OMG WAT A GEM PLACE TO EAT LOCAL,50,15 December 2013,Absolute a brilliant find that is easy from the MRT at Orchard and one stop away. you just need to follow the roundabout road to go over a walking fly over to reach it.Every trade stall holder was so astonished that you had arrived there and boost about their chef talents.. Best tasting fish ever!!! and in some case paid no more than the equivalent one pound for a meal.....
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and plentiful,40,21 November 2013,This hawker centre was close to our hotel and had been recommended by an expat friend. We found out from local colleagues that it tends to get better reviews from expats than locals who don't think it's as good as other hawker centres in Singapore. For us it was convenient but also had great seafood dishes that were very reasonably priced. It was clean and had a really vibrant atmosphere. It's also open until late at night - some stalls stay open 24/7. Worth a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Store 70,40,16 November 2013,"Recently had a meal at Newton hawker centre. Store 70 was the best. A must for service and quality. We could not fault the meal, plus we ordered food from another stall which they work together, this made for a memorable meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Shop 66 for Chilli Stingray,50,13 November 2013,"If you head to shop 66 for the best chilli stingray, I always go back there to Stanley when I'm in town. Love this with a nice cold beer! Its really just a local outside food court with the best chilli stinray."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for indian food!,40,12 November 2013,"Been living here for the last 2 years and have found this place to be close to food from home!A great ambiance and superb sevice , Mohan who is the owner knows how to make you come back for more ! A must visit place for Indians in singapore :)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food and inexpensive, if done properly!!",40,6 November 2013,"We ate here twice as it was close to our hotel, just a short walk from Newton MRT station. The first night we were silly and let one of the stall holders show us to a table and pressure us into ordering way to much food as well as garlic tiger prawns which although absolutely amazing, almost doubled our bill!! The next night, after reading up on how to do it properly, we chose a table then went up to order dishes from various stalls. This way you get exactly what you want and know exactly how much you owe! A nice mix of tourists and locals eating, which is always a good sign! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Stall 70 Seafood,40,2 November 2013,"Some seagood is sold by weight so be aware for lobster & tiger prawns, otherwise price known before ordering. Mrs Tan will do gluten free sauces or hold on the side, no-one else understood our request. Yummy, quality fresh fish. Search carefully as some venders don't have the same quality (frozen). Walked from the Royal Plaza (fantastic) on Scotts. Great local experience..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but be careful!!,40,27 October 2013,"Silly little me got a bit carried away and forgot to ask for the total before ordering our food. The bill was double what we should have been paying so please be careful as the stall owners are trying to pull a fast one on tourists. But in saying this we took our time and picked the food we wanted to eat, it was delicious, well cooked and full of flavour. We had Black Pepper King Prawns and Chilli Sqiud plus a couple of mammoth Tiger beers. I still enjoyed the experience even tho we were swindled for a few extra dollars. Fair play! Haha"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore chilli crab,40,19 October 2013,"Looking for a traditional Singapore dish on our last night in Singapore we took a taxi to Newton food market. The place was packed full of locals and tourists. We were soon shown to a table by one of the over eager stall owners touting for business. We ordered Singapore chilli crab and Hainanese Chicken and was not disappointed. The crab was fresh hot and spicy with the contrast of chicken mild and moist We had a selection of noodles, rice ,vegetables and Tiger beer total bill came to 60 Singapore dollars. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Singapore and enjoyed the atmosphere and found the locals in Singapore very friendly and polite. ( Travelling onto Australia Brisbane, Surfers Paradise )Neil and LouiseBlackpool"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",not bad,40,17 October 2013,"a good place to visit if you like to mingle with and eat like the locals. there is plenty of choice, however, be prepared to be pressured into buying from particular vendors. I guess that's why they call it a hawkers centre. you cannot walk 5 feet without being approached to eat at their food stall. a good and vibrant atmosphere and worth the visit if not just for the experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but was looking for more,30,16 October 2013,The food was good but not great. I liked the chili crab but Im sure I could have had a better version of it somewhere else. Its really hard to know exactly which stall will have the best food. The Chicken Rice I had was not good at all. We had better food at the satay stands close to Lau Pa Sat (closed for 2 more months apparently). I liked Makansutra better to be honest.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too tourist focus,20,10 October 2013,"I wish the hawkers focus on the quality and taste of their products. It not exactly sheep to eat here, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired. V disappointed, especially to some brought up in Malaysia and Melbourne"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad place with a standard food,20,1 October 2013,"The food seller is pretty aggressive and annoying, not like any other hawker center.
The food price is a bot high, maybe it is because there're too many advertising promoting this place, so they tend to put higher price for their food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Beware of touting, do not settle for the 1st stall owner who approaches you",40,17 September 2013,"I'm staying at Singapore and hardly dine at Newton Food Center since it's notorious for overcharging. However, the coach that I took returning from Malaysia stopped at Newton, I decided to settle for a quick dinner. The last time I came here was years ago...My 1st impression was touting is so rampant here, something that is so rare in Singapore.My advice for visitors, especially tourist from overseas, DO NOT settle for the 1st stall owner who manage to find you a seat. You are absolutely free to sit anywhere and order from any stall.I also realise that those who were touting are all the seafood stalls holder. From my observation over an hour there, many tourist actually ordered only seafood from the stall holder who found them a vacant table and gave many other nice food a miss since they didn't even walk around the food center.Please walk around and choose other food as well besides seafood, which is way overcharged at Newton Food Center and does not really taste good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of my favourite hawker centres,40,14 September 2013,I first discovered this hawker centre the first time I came to Singapore and it's still just as good value and has such a wide variety of food as it ever had! Just a short walk from the Newton MRT station! Thoroughly recommended to all visitors to Singapore!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must eat here!,40,12 September 2013,"Visited Singapore 4 times in the last 4 years and every single time have stopped for a meal at Newton circus. Nearly all the hawkers sell the same food, however i go towards the ones that sell more seafood. Fried rice, Prawns , even the veggies are fabulous. Open till quite late , fun to sit outside with the place being always crowded. Decently priced as well. Must eat here atleast once when you visit singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check out Denmark Seafood #49,50,9 September 2013,"Asked a local cab driver to take us to somewhere to eat good crab, and he bought us to the Newton Hawker Centre. After being hassled by several very pushy restaurant touters, we started speaking to San from Denmark Seafood who was friendly, polite & great to deal with.We had chilli crab, black pepper crab, tiger prawns that are bigger than your hand & some greens, and a few tiger beers for good measure. We left full & satisfied, and for a lot less than we paid at no signboard seafood the night before."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's a must!,50,7 September 2013,"Yes I know the locals will say its not authentic enough and way too pricey! But it must do something right when it's been here for decades and still one gets an excellent meal for good prices. My recent visit happened on a Friday night, filled with families and friends all feasting on crabs, lobsters, shells and the typical local fair. Each stall will bring the food to you, which is what I love about street food here, one doesn't need to navigate the crowds to find a seat and then try to not spill your food. We had giant grilled prawns, a round of satay and vegetables. Tasted great and the along with the atmosphere a must for not only those living here but the tourist as well. For the tourists have no fear, it's clean, all B ratings, friendly and has bathroom amenities too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Food,40,5 September 2013,"If you want to try out some authentic food of Singapore, this is the place to be. This is quite famous for being there for decades now, and I first found out about it from my dad who went there in the 1990s. I've been there twice, each of my two SG stay. It is like a giant outdoor foodcourt where tourists and locals alike eat and drink. Owners will enthusiastically call and encourage you to buy from their booths as you pass by them. However, we were stopped by a local owner who called out that were Filipinos, and continuously said ""Masarap alimango"" (translation: delicious crab). We were taken to a table, followed by the food owner with it's graphic menu and detailed prices. This made us communicate with each other easier. We wanted something else not on the menu, so he referred us to his co-seller. The food would be delivered to our table, and we had to pay up immediately. What we ate: Cereal Prawns, Chicken and Pork Satay, Chinese-cooked Cabbage, and Yang Chow Fried Rice. (During my first visit, we ordered Chili Crabs and Lemon Chicken). Overall, it was a good experience as we savored our food up to the last bite. We spent around 10 sgd each.The only thing I'd like to comment is that it's quite tricky going there using the MRT or Bus. Make sure to memorize the bus numbers or train station you'd get off to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",good choice for hawker center,50,1 September 2013,"clean, convenient location, non offensive /aggressive barkers, over all good choice, Not sure if true but we were told this is only open at night"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to try out local fare,30,31 August 2013,Good place to try out local fare if you stay near orchard. . The fish soup near to the Carpark is great. The rest you can get around the same standard at a cheaper price elsewhere. Be careful of ordering seafood. Got some experiences of rip off by the hawkers there. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap local food!,40,28 August 2013,"Excellent local food! Cheap if you don't mind the ambience. Beers are extremely cheap! Had a local Tiger beer and a Heineken and still had money in my pants!!!! Try the sambal stingray.... I know, sounds strange but its awesome! a little bit spicy but what the hey!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Save some cash and sample new tastes,40,26 August 2013,"Experience a little atmosphere in a tourist-safe area. Try some dishes without breaking the bank. Hawkers from individual stands will try to convince you to eat in their booth, but be patient and walk around until you see something that interests you. Hawkers are assertive but not aggressive. Be sure to establish the price as you order, not afterward. Dont rely on the posted price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Terrific local food, but watch the prices",40,25 August 2013,"Loads of local food here, but many repeats among the vendors. Find a place and go back. Vendors will remember you and give you great service next time. Be careful about the seafood prices. Veggies and chicken are inexpensive here, but many of the seafood items can be quite pricey. You may enjoy a few jumbo tiger prawns then find out that plate cost $50. Discuss with the vendor beforehand so you aren't surprised.We particularly enjoyed sugar cane juice with lime or lemon from the juice stands, to go with our food. Great place!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, moderately priced, good evening atmosphere.",40,24 August 2013,"We went with locals, were met by people keen for you to eat their food. Good humoured and not pushy. Order your food, give them your table number and your food arrives pretty promptly having been freshly prepared. Great calamari, garlic prawns, vegetables and rice. Naan and dhaal.Locals definitely are here plus a handful of tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus food hawker centre,50,16 August 2013,If you are looking for where the locals go to eat - try Newton Circus - train to Newton Circus walk to the overpass and there is it - one of the biggest selection of food hawker shops available in Singapore. Try Chili or Pepper crab - choose your own live crab - butter prawns or the grilled Malaysian sting ray. YUM YUM YUM.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must for foodies,50,15 August 2013,good food with varieties to choose from. have to check the price before you order any seafood items or it might turn out to be a little over your budget.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Is not the cheapest but good quality!,40,4 August 2013,"The best part of this hawker center is that they close late. They have the main singaporean delights, really clean and nice setting."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",straight simple cheap,50,1 August 2013,"after a late night out the best place to grab a wholesome meal is right here, the food is amazing and you get a wide variety, at 2.30 am the place was very busy, we stuck to simple food, fried rice, prata, sweet and sour chicken and nasi gorang all in 20$ amazing"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap food,40,27 July 2013,"We ate here twice, with our 3 children. Had amazing mee goreng and murtabak. So cheap, cost $20 to feed our whole family. You need to ignore the tauters, the stall owners are not supposed to approach you with menus but some do. We didn't find it too busy but we were there by 6.30pm, if you eat later it can get very busy. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid! Avoid!,10,20 July 2013,Everyone will tell you that this is a FAMOUS place to eat local food in Singapore. I've lived here 13 years and the place always gives me the creeps and makes me feel cheated by the aggressive hawkers selling their expensive seafood. The only time I ever go there is if I'm stuck in the neighborhood at lunch time and have no other option. If anyone were to invite me to a group party there in the future...I'd pass.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Convenient location, good food",40,15 July 2013,"Even if people complain that the the newton hawker center is overpriced, touristy, etc, etc... One can't deny that it is convenient to get to and is quite near orchard road. It is still reasonable but like any other similar eating places around the world, you should watch your bill and what you are paying for.Just went during the day with a lot of stalls closed. To get the full experience, it is recommended to go in the evening 7pm onwards. Ended up eating and getting my favorite stingray and sambal kangkong in stall 53. It was very good, decently priced, and surprisingly - the owners were very nice and friendly! Also left my bag in front of their stall and the female owner was nice enough to see it and hold it for me.No matter what people say, the convenience of newton circle for me is the main draw."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Dodgy Seafood hawkers,30,13 July 2013,Seafood very fresh but be careful that you get what you pay for. Some hawkers will try to sell you over priced seafood so make sure they weigh it in front of your eyes as you pay per 100 gramms.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Get into the Singapore vibe!,40,8 July 2013,"You must experience this hawker centre on your visit to Singapore, it is truly unique and pleasantly surprised at the range of foods, cultural differences mixing with the locals. We avoided rush hour and had a late lunch around 2:30pm, no the queues! We had the fried kway Tao a Singaporean speciality, the chicken rice was to melt in your mouth, the satays fresh and tasty, roti with peanut sauce, the vegetables so green! All washed down with a cold icy tiger beer, you need this! Thoroughly recommend you do this, we are doing it again. Take tissues to mark your table and wipes for cleaning afterwards. There are ceiling fans but its all in the open air. It cost us sgd$15 per head including a large beer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an amazing city for food,40,26 June 2013,"every stall got a tasty favours that make us go again and again. the only problem is that they don't have tissues for the customers.
thanks alot for the very nice food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Favourite for >35 years. Still Excellent!,50,26 June 2013,"I've been going to Newton since 1977 when I began going to a school in the area, and it's still my hawker centre of choice when I return from my new home in Melbourne.It may be slightly more expensive than other more-local hawker centres, but it offers a great array of choice and the food is generally of very good quality. Singaporeans will sometimes complain of quality on the basis that locals often look for 'best of breed' in dishes, and Newton may not have a replica of ""mum's lamb roast"". Having said that, as far as I am concerned Bee Heng Popiah and Heng Carrot Cake (try the white version with chilli) are outstanding, and the best of their kind in Singapore. Wash those dishes down with sugar can juice and it'll cost you $10-15 at most and put a wide smile on your face.Is it touristy (as is the occasional complaint)? All of Singapore is, and not more so at Newton. In fact, it's typically filled with locals until about 10pm, when more tourists start filing in.Newton has never disappointed me (except when my favourite stalls are closed! - I think on Tuesdays). Don't miss it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Please read you wont be disappointed,40,23 June 2013,I used to live around the corner form newton circus hawker center - I've probably eaten here 100 timesEnter on the bukit timah rd entrance and walk along the outside and right before the end you can turn in on your left - dont turn in but sit down there as there's a great juice stand and next door is the seafood place where you should order1) bbq sting ray2) satay but you have to walk in and find a malaysian satay stand as their satay is always tastier than the thai/chinese/indian stands as they use a better marinade3) try the oyster omlette something different but a must try if you're in singapore4) the locals say try chicken rice i think its the most overated local cuisine ive ever tried same with the chili crab a local delicacy - i would stay clear of both of them5) get a chicken fried rice 6) get a bak choy or stir fry beans to go with the sting ray and rice and satay (beef/chicken/venison get 6 of each to try)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Slightly off the tourist map, but totally worth visiting",40,22 June 2013,"Take the MRT, and walk the rest of the way – it's totally worth it. The food and drinks are excellent and cheap. You get a sense of the local culture at Newton Circus. I always cherish opportunities like this whenever I travel - a chance to interact with the locals on their turf.Mind you, being a foreigner, you will get harassed by the hawkers to try their stall over their neighbours. Other reviews dwelled a bit much on the pushiness of the people. It's not as bad as they make it sound."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worst hawker centre in Singapore ...,10,16 June 2013,Rude and pushy vendors ...late night fights and very very pricy...they only want to sell large BBQ overpriced prawns ....AVOID !!!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Handy for lunch / early evening local food,40,10 June 2013,"Easy to get to (walking distance from Orchard Scotts residences where we were staying), and with many options for local street food. Cheap and cheerful, but with friendly service - a number of the vendors remembered us after only one or two visits."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good memories on top of good memories,50,3 June 2013,"I first ate here a few years back with a friend and I loved the wide variety and the taste of the food in spite of the then crude appearance of the place.This time, I came back with my husband, kids and a small group of close friends and was pleasantly surprised. The place had been renovated, and very well, I must say. The food stalls are now at the periphery and the tables are in a central open-air area. It encourages socializing.Upon entering, one is assaulted by all kinds of delicious smells. Of course we knew that it would be impossible to order everything but we certainly tried--crabs, fish, chicken, squid, oysters, pork, beef, mixed satay and shellfish. The food was not fast but was well-prepared.There was no one trying to hurry us up. We were able to catch up uninterrupted. The only drawback to the evening really was the heat. Summer. Unfortunately, no electric fans in the open air part. But the food and the ambiance made one willing to sweat it out. So my previous memories of great food have now been reinforced with more memories of great food AND ambiance. Newton will definitely be on our itinerary the next time we're in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A nice spot for hawker,30,29 May 2013,"The food here is not bad, there are many choices around but it seems to be centred towards seafood. Be warned though, the seafood stall people will definitely pester you to order from their stalls. Be firm."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food and atmosphere,50,27 May 2013,A very relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere at this clean food centre. Food is inexpensive and delicious!! Particularly the chicken murtabak.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with locals,50,23 May 2013,"This place is buzzing, plenty of choices and cooked fresh, we were told to get price of food before buying to make sure not to pay too much. But we had no problems"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood haven,40,22 May 2013,Just be careful - always ask for prices first before ordering!! We spent quite a hefty bill normally spent on 5* restaurant.. But the food was absolutely delicious
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but very touristic,30,21 May 2013,"The food here is nice, but for a Hawker Centre it is overpriced as they know many tourists come here. You can also find better food at a cheaper price in other Hawkers."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Tourist Trap,30,14 May 2013,"There are almost 100 diffent talls all selling much the same food. I was told that this was cheaper and a lot more local Singaporeans ran this up until a few years ago. The food is still good but beware of the prices. Ask price before you order or you will get ripped off. Our meal for three with prawns, BBQ Stingray and Chilli Crab was $128.00"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Overrated- Overpriced, pushy staff that rip you off",10,5 May 2013,"If you want a hawker experience go somewhere else- La Pau Sat, Chinatown, Tiong Bahru but not Newton. You get pushed into buying very overpriced food, it's not a normal hawker experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food,30,25 April 2013,"Like:Close to orchard Scotts
Disliked: too many approach from staff to buy food in certain stall.
Too crowded in some nights."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Becoming expensive overpriced & portions reducing in size !,30,24 April 2013,Used to be very good and cheap a few years back I don't mind the touting after all it's an open air hawker food centre and that's what you will get ! Definitely over priced for such small portions and the old Newton circus hawker center many years ago was much better but I must say the food is still delicious . Better find somewhere more affordable next time.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore food institution,50,23 April 2013,"Yes it is usually hot and humid, and by no means a high dining experience, but the chili crab is to die for (approx 30-35 SGD for a whole crab) and it is always great food. Very family friendly, and wallet friendly too. Always try the fresh lime juice to wash it all down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over priced and too harassing, better hawker centres nearly everywhere else",20,21 April 2013,"We were warned about the inflated prices, but were still happy to try the experience . Very disappointing, the food was average and not as good or at least no better than food we had eaten at other hawker centres, including those within shopping malls. The harassment from vendors was relentless and made it hard to browse the food stalls. The prices were much too high for the size & quality of the food we had, definitely would not go back or recommend"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Local food and fun,40,17 April 2013,"Hawker areas which frequent Singapore are great places to enjoy the local cuisine in a relaxed outdoor atmosphere. Newton Circus is only a short walk from the Newton MTR station. One word of caution – the food in hawkers is generally very reasonably priced except the large prawns and the chili crabs – Singapore specialities. All food is a stated fixed price except these items which are by weight. Make sure if you want these items, you ask for them to be weighed in front of you and ask what the total price will be. Many unsuspecting customers have been shocked by bills totalling several hundred dollars when they thought they were having a “cheap” meal. It is common for the weights to be exaggerated if you are not careful and have the items weighed in front of you. Do not let this detract from trying one of these areas though as everything else is really cheap and the food is amazing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre,30,7 April 2013,"1) The ambience does not seem the same , after the renovation
2)Some stalls still over-charging.
3)Choices of stalls variety seem to be down"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","overpriced, crowded, too much hussle and hassle",20,6 April 2013,"we went for a quick family dinner and having lived in Singapore for many years we feel quite ""local"", but here we were treated like fresh off the airplane foreigners and the prices quoted for fish and seafood were way beyond what market price is elsewhere. Vist for the experience but take care!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Mixed skills and different quality local food,30,3 April 2013,It used to be one of the best places to eat at in Singapore and my family often frequent there but much has changed. Not every stall that you go to serve you good local food. You've to be wiser and more selective now. I recall the Thai food stall there is one of the best. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ikan bakar,40,27 March 2013,"hot and spices Ikan Bakar and lala, I like. too many variety sometime don't know what to eat, but is a nice place to go.Why Singapore Seafood so expensive...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nice seafood, a little more expensive than other food centres.",30,19 March 2013,"The seafood here is mostly good, but you will pay more here than you would at another food centre as many tourist are brought here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Many visitors come for local foods,30,18 March 2013,"Many staffs, different kind of foods, near ochard area , expensive and mainly for tourist! Different staffs with different standards. You must ask how much the price especially for sea food stalls. Some times cost a lot because the charge by weight , like fish , prawn , crab and etc.If the stall is long queue , normally , the food is nice!So, open your eye to observe, your nose to smell,.. and may ask your friends! Enoyed your food !!!! Good luck :-} Sun"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must do thing for all Non - Vegetarian Sea Food Lovers,40,17 March 2013,I like the food.... but some might not like the rush atmosphere. But its a good experience and different kind of taste compared to many other places.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth a visit,30,16 March 2013,"Regarded as a tourist venue with 'expensive' hawker food, for most visitors it will be more than a worthwhile visit and not deemed expensive. It has certainly become more ' established' than when last there some twenty two years ago.There are plenty of other hawker venues that are more authentic and cheaper...but was happy to go with friends who had never been."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,30,15 March 2013,"After many years of eating at Newton circus, we just don't anymore. It has become far too expensive. It is a shame that it has become so commercial and expensive. We might try again soon, but at this stage it is not going to be for quite some time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Realtively recently-renovated hawker centres,30,14 March 2013,"The hawker centre at Newton Circus badly needed and received a renovation. It it well-known by the tourist crowd. It is not heavily frequented by the locals, as there are much better hawker centres around the island."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average food at best,20,14 March 2013,"The fact that I lived a 10-minute walk away from this establishment but only visited the place 5 times in 6 years tells you all you need to know. Let's start with the good. It's spacious, ventilated, clean, you're spoilt for choice and there's a nice buzz about the place. Now for the not-so-good. If you're a food snob, there are other tastier places to go to for local food - way better. Secondly, the harrassment you receive from the hawker stall assistants can be frustrating. There are strict rules about touting at Newton and i tend to look the at my options from afar so as to not be pressured into making a decision. Next the price. Be aware, that Newton is a pricey neighbourhood just a stone's throw from Orchard Road. As such stall rentals are expensive and need to be covered. So expect to pay more for your food. Watch out for the seafood prices. Most locals won't go to Newton for the seafood so I would advice that you double check the price for prawns/crabs etc before placing your order. Lastly taxis can be a challenge to find when you're done eating/drinking so do be prepared to take the train/bus."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really a Tourist Trap,20,14 March 2013,"Good food stalls wouldn't park themselves here. Everyone here is out to make a big buck from innocent tourists. They had a renovation few years ago to spruce their image, but in the process much of the good food has run away from the obscene rentals. Only came here with a foreign friend who insisted on trying. He became receptive to my recommendations at other places after that meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing local food under one roof,50,12 March 2013,I visit the food court once a month or so. Love the spread and ambience. Best dish so far: BBQ StingRay.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Touristy, but probably worth it for the experience",30,28 February 2013,"I am old enough to remember the good old days in Singapore when mobile food stalls were wheeled into places at night and set up in a hive of activity to provide a range of good quality, cheap and delicious varieties of dishes that you could watch being cooked, and virtually without tourists so you got the real deal at rock bottom prices. The one at the Cold Store Car Park off Orchard Road was my favourite (if anybody can remember that far back!). Alas such itinerant food stalls no longer exist, all being now confined (on the grounds of hygiene) to a permanent stalls at fixed locations such as the Newton Hawker Centre– this being one of the largest. Oh well, all good things change over time, but I have to say that it is not as good as the old transient stalls.Having said that it is an interesting experience for the uninitiated, although it has become too touristy and not as good as some other, less tourist-orientated food centres – much better food can be had in Chinatown. Nevertheless, if you want to go for the experience then there are some good dishes to be found, although they do vary. My advice would be to walk around firstly to decide what you want, ignoring the blandishments of the stall owners who try to entice you to sit at their table. Probably 75-80% offer the same things, but some offer different or specialist dishes. Also, remember you don’t have to eat everything from the same stall, as if you fancy something from another stall then order it and they will bring it to you – but do ensure you make it clear to them where you are sitting (and best not to pick something from too far away, although if you don’t pay for it until it’s delivered they will find you!). If you want to eat all dishes at the same time, then ensure you get the timing of your order right if ordering from different stalls (order from the furthest stall first)It’s also worth noting that the Newton Centre is not particularly convenient for walking or public transport, and although taxis are cheap and easy to find to take you there early on, they are not so easy to get to go home later in the evening as most that turn up have been pre-booked. It is possible to flag one down on the adjacent main road, but you may have to wait a while before a free one passes, so you might consider ordering a taxi in advance to take you home and avoid much frustrating waving at taxis when all you want is to return to your hotel room!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Open stalls with various selection of food,40,26 February 2013,"Good place to hanging out & try local delicacy. But be prepare of the hot, smokey, busy & noisy situation.I was pretty disturbed with all the stall staff which tried to promote their menu and sometime pushy. Try the sting-ray fish (I can't remember which stall), but I try two different stall & both taste good. I must be lucky.There's stall named Indian Palace which totally match to my taste. I always afraid to try Indian food because of the heavy spices & bad aftertaste. This one taste mild but so good & pretty authentic, it still leave a spice aftertaste, but not as bad as I thought."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An old Reliable,40,26 February 2013,We revisited Newtons Circus after my first visit 25 years ago and I went to re taste my initial dish from then - the Mutton Murtabak . I found it and was not disappointed . Cold Beers Hawker Food on only 1 watch salesman!!! Gotta love Singapore
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","overpriced, overhyped - living off vulnerable and less aware visitors",20,25 February 2013,"i visited this brothel of an eatery several times in years gone by and vowed i would not return. however i did, with three friends who were visiting singapore and insisted they must visit newton circus. alas nothing has changed except the prices - now more ludicrous than ever - definition of 'market price' is the maximum that the food seller feels he can rip the customer off without provoking violence (at which point local 'helpers' insist you pay your bill). food was average, service aggressive, and prices high. as many posters have said, there are many less expensive and, frankly, better hawker centers - try maxwell road, the food street in chinatown, farrer road, or even go out to changi village."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware but good food if you know the place,40,25 February 2013,"This is a classic touristy place in Singapore but that doesn't mean all the stalls serve touristy food. I lived in Singapore for two years and have visited other times and still enjoy the experience here because I can get all the food I want in one location. I would steer clear of the seafood as there are better places to get it but the carrot cake, Kway Teow, and Chicken Wings are all good. I also like the big area and that they deliver to your table. This is a good place for a tourist to wet their appetites but beware of price and quality."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced tourist trap,20,19 February 2013,"Newton Hawker centre is an overpriced tourist trap, particularly the stalls selling seafood. You can get food of the same or better quality at lower prices at any of the hawker centers in Singapore. The stalls on the edge, away from where the tourists normally go are much better value. If you want the atmosphere, and the seafood than Long Beach at Dempsey is better (although it is also a bit of a tourist trap) whereas if you want the Hawker experience than Lau Pa Sat has a wider variety at proper prices"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food!,40,12 February 2013,The selection of food was great and the prices were very reasonable. All the stalls were extremely clean and hygienic!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Center,50,7 February 2013,"This was where we eat the first night in SG, it was a nice experience, though it is a hawker center its clean, and food is great. The place is just near Newton station, exit A..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth the visit,50,6 February 2013,"While holidaying in Singapore we took our friends to the Newton Hawker Centre as this was their first visit. They were amazed if not a little cautious at what was on offer. We picked a stall and feasted on a variety of dishes from king prawns (they had never seen ones so big), a mixture of satay and some other tasty dishes. They said it was the best meal they had ever had. We were looked after so well. We know we paid far more than what the locals would but we realised that being tourists they were likely to put their prices up. When comparing it with what you would pay in Australian dollars we were still very happy and would still go back again. An experience worth having and no, none of us got sick, for those who are apprehensive about eating at these places."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey,30,3 February 2013,Worth the try but a bit pricey compare to other locals hawker centre. Good to go there once for the experience.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,10,1 February 2013,"Most of the food here is over-rated, though I find the Muslim food pretty good. If you are in thsi area, why not try the Adam Rd Food Centre, which has better choice of local food but with better prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best food in Singapore!,50,29 January 2013,"Having a great selection of foods you will not be disappointed!My favourite being the Chilli Stingray, and sweet chinese buns! I was brought here by friends from Singapore and they tell me that it is the best food. There are other hawker stalls and other places you can get the same dishes - but you can get everything here and eat all at one table!Top tip - make sure you shop around, a lot of stalls sell similar foods so make sure you ask the price before you commit!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of seafood,40,29 January 2013,"If you're looking to experience a wide range of seafood, then Newton Hawker Centre is the place to go. So many stalls offering a great selection of seafood. The prawns and satays are definitely a must. I would recommend having a look around all the stalls before you decide what and where you want to get the food from. Be aware of people coming up to you asking if you need a table etc - once you say yes, they'll show you to a table then hang around getting you to order food with them. It got a little annoying after a while. You shouldn't really have trouble finding a table so it's probably easier to order the food yourself (just know your table number before you order food because generally the stall vendors will tell you they will bring the food to you). Overall it was a very enjoyable night and I definitely preferred Newton to Lau Pa Sat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection,50,21 January 2013,My favourite place for Sting Ray. Like many of the Hawker Centres in Singapore the seating is basic but oh the food! Get a taste of how the locals dine out. :-)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Largely tourists,30,20 January 2013,Mainly an evening night experience for tourists ... there are better places ...... Beware of seafood prices check beforehand
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore Experience,30,18 January 2013,"Going to a hawker centre like this can be a daunting exprience, knowing you will be attacked by people trying to get you to sit and order food with them, but a trip to Singapore should include a visit to this for the experience. The food also is usually excellent - and unless one orders something very special, one can have a delicious meal and be very surprised at how little they paid at the end of the meal. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Same ol' food, twice the price",20,17 January 2013,Newton hawker centre and Boat Quay must have shared the same founder. Head down to East Coast hawker for a better deal and better view.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice local foodfare,30,15 January 2013,"NIce spread of local food, but for foreigners, please beware of the cheaters there, who tend to hike up their charges when they sense tourist presence. Make sure you ask the price before ordering!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",thumbs up!!,50,11 January 2013,"Most of ma friends says the food now is not as great as how it used to be..
I still like the food there..great Seafood!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good service, great food",50,10 January 2013,"Great atmosphere, food was fresh and quick.
BYO available.
The staff were helpful and informative.
ATMs on site.
Good toilet facilities.
Easy to access by MRT, taxi and bus."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not impressed,20,8 January 2013,"Nothing much. Despite the recommendations to go there for the food, I do not get the attraction simple because for that price and the kind of food, I can get it at other hawker centres at better price and similar taste"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","So this is, the famous Newton Hawker Centre",30,7 January 2013,"...and we lived in Singapore so long and everybody is talking about it, so we went. Well...ok.....by far not the as good and cost effective and nice as others. ...and we heard that real Singaporeans would not go there either. May be good for tourists?"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Travelled for 40 min to get here and a little dissapointed,30,4 January 2013,"Didnt like the way they all jump on you to eat at there stall, no other Centres do this and I think they chase tourist away with this pushy attitude, not nice for ladies to be jumped upon like this, food experience was not as good as other Centres"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful local fare - fabulous fruit,40,2 January 2013,"We went for an evening meal here courtesy of a local Singaporean couple who we had met several times over the years. We had never eaten at a Hawkers Market away from Orchard road. The food was wonderful, our hosts treated us to a selection of local dishes in this bustling location. I would visit again on our own but would not have been too confident going there for the first time without local company. I didn't know most of the dishes and there are touts who try to push menus, if I had been alone I would have thought they were waiters of some sort! Be firm and a bit wary of being taken advantage of and it is a great place with great food. The fruit stalls on the outer rim of the Market were incredible, selection, quality and quantity - on our next visit it is firmly on our list of places to eat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,30,2 January 2013,"Std Hawer food, will not travel there as a Singaporean. There are other places with similar food, better taste and more reasonable price"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Busy Hawker Centre, be early! (for both parking and seating)",30,31 December 2012,One of the many outstanding Hawker centres that Singapore has. A nice way of getting to know Singaporean and in general Asean food. This place is very popular so you have to be early and taking a taxi is preferred.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go before 6pm,30,27 December 2012,"We arrived approximately 1500 to find only about 10% of the store were open for business, luckily we found michaels little shop who provided us sting ray, calamari, prawns and chili mud crab. All of the above we're cooked we'll and tasted fantastic, with bags of flavour. Value was not fantastic but service was very helpful.Not a bad place to visit, just come in the evening when every thing is open "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful food and beer is a fair price,40,19 December 2012,I have visited several times over the years. The food is still excellent. Take time to wander around before making your selection and don't buy everything from one stall. Particulary recommend the satay from a small stall in the far corner (near the loos).Large bottles of Tiger beer were selling for S$6-50 each - great value when compared to the S$15 to S$18 per pint chargred by many of the bars.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Sting Ray Tastic,50,18 December 2012,"Yes it's the 'touristy' place, but also mobbed by locals, hell pay a little more and you'll still enjoy it.
Chilli Stingray especially good. Poh Pia too"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lively atmosphere, fantastic seafood!!",50,17 December 2012,"Always love Newton for seafood. Will always have the bbq stingray, boiled gong gong, cockles and chilli crab whenever we are there. And they have halal-certified stalls. Luv luv!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Food/Hawker stalls...,40,14 December 2012,"This place has turned into a place for tourists. It used to be one of the premier places to go for hawker stall experiences but now, the costs are up there and it seems to be all tourists. Which is ok. But I live here and there are just too many places that are similar that don't cost anywhere near the same. (Chinatown for one). The food is good and you get decent service but.. well, there are other places to go. If you do want to go and see it.. go in the afternoon or very early evening to miss the crowds. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Marketed to tourists,30,5 December 2012,Certain stalls are good but the place is a tourist attraction so prices are overall more expensive than other hawker centres.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tons of variety, casual, affordable",40,4 December 2012,"Real Singapore Hawker experience, large with many varieties of cuisine, it can be hard to make a choice. Food is all affordable and tasty and casual."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to visit,30,2 December 2012,"Newton circus used to be the go-to place for Singaporean suppers, but there are so many other options available now![Alfresco/Outdoors]1. Chomp Chomp Food Centre (at Serangoon Gardens) Accessible by public transport, but any self-respecting taxi driver will be able to bring you there. Small, only open from 6pm. It has the best BBQ stingray in town. 2. East Coast Lagoon Food CentreAt the end of east coast. Great place if you were planning to visit East Coast Park.3. Glutton's BayStarted by a famous food critic, , he brought together the best of Singapore tastes in one convenient spott (beside the Esplanade). Also opens till late, this is my favourite supper spot after catching a show at the Esplanade or Marina Bay Sands theatre. 4. Food Republic Beer GardenIn the footsteps of Glutton's Bay, this newly opened makan place is right beside St James Power Station, which is a great stop after a day at Sentosa. [Air-conditioned]All-time favourite: Food Republic at Wisma Atria. It has all the yummy local food like fried Hokkein mee and carrot cake. The more expensive sister brand is Food Opera, B4 of Ion Orchard."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",average food at high prices,20,27 November 2012,There are only a couple of stalls at the Newton Hawker centre that I would patronize....the Malay rice stall ( Nasi Padang ) and the Duck Noodle stall. All the other stalls are over priced and not that great in terms of food quality.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Probably still the most well known Hawker Center in Singapore,40,25 November 2012,"The place is a little pricey compared to other Hawker Cennters in Singapore and reputation recently blemished by overcharging foreign visitors. However, I still think you get the best food varities here and quality are very good. It shouldn't be missed by any overseas visitor and make sure you check the prices before ordering. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Central,40,21 November 2012,"Probably 70 stalls selling fresh seafood can't be beat. Butter Prawns, pepper crab, grilled tiger prawns, the list goes on. If you don't like seafood probably not the place for you."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive food!,10,18 November 2012,The food is expensive and not even that good by local standards. Tourist trap! Please avoid going to this place if possible. Hawker food in singapore is really much cheaper and better tasting at other places. One of the main draws of this place might be that it is open till late at night. But there are other alternatives available.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap,10,17 November 2012,"So many much better places to eat local food without the rudeness of the vendors,overpricing and often poor food quality.............Singapore hawker food can be brilliant but generally not here.This is where you go if you are using an outdated guidebook. Try Lau Pa Sat instead."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore's worst kept secret.,10,17 November 2012,Touting is prohibited but there are many ways you could be harass. The most expense outdoor food centre in the city. The Tourist Promotion is the biggest culprit. They should not call this lemon an apple.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Back again,50,16 November 2012,"Not sure why people do not like newton circus/food center. Great atmosphere, my wife & I have been going here for over 20 years. You can buy cheaper food I agree at food courts, but they are so bland & the cleaning is very dubious. When entering, do not sit where the first person tells you to sit, just walk around looking & what is available. Be polite they are trying to run a business in a competitive market. Normally you get 3 serve sizes to choose from. We have only ever had seafood, eg prawns on a couple of occasions, as that is expensive, but if you want tiger prawns, ask them to weigh in front of you. Garlic style is the best. My favorite is Mr Lee at stall number 46. Pepper beef. Calamari was OK but the batter was a bit thick. In the end we had 4 choices that cost $65 sg.Ice cold tiger beer @ $6.50 for a large bottle."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's good but more expensive,30,6 November 2012,"I go there all the time because it's close to where I stay. The food there are nice, such as chicken rice, Hokkien noodles, satay, and seafood. But since the seafood price don't show on menu, they charge tourists more. Make sure you compare the price before you order!!!! I am serious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Harassed by dishonest vendors,10,31 October 2012,"This is a disgusting place to eat due to heat, humidity, poor hygiene and dishonesty.Store vendor # 49 pestered us to eat there and after circulating the food court once and being hounded by store vendors with what is essentially the same menu, we settled down at #49. Instantly the affiliated drink vendor requested that we order from him and so two coconut juices were bought for S$6. The crab was supposedly 900 grams and was quite tasty in Singaporean chilli sauce. When asked how much in total, the owner suddenly could not converse in English. The next dish two tiger prawns in garlic sauce were dry and bland. We dipped it in the sauce of the crab dish. The oily fried rice was equally bland and also had to be drenched in chilli sauce.Whilst dining, owner of #49 calculated on a napkin and when the bill for S$100 arrived we requested for a receipt. The receipt arrived five minutes later with the description “seafood dinner”. We asked for some descriptions and five minutes later abbreviations and prices were made available on the receipt. We took photographs of the complaints number to call but never managed to call. Would it have made any difference? Surely we were not the first customers to be cheated. After all that chilli we had some crushed ice desserts which was cooling and escaped the place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,10,29 October 2012,"From the moment you arrive you are pestered by store owners desperate for you to try their chilli crab or swordfish. Each store holder will try to convince you that the tables near their store are theirs (which obviously they aren't) and force you to sit with one of their menus.The food is overpriced and available much more cheaply elsewhere. It's quality is dubious and generally much lower than what you will find a Food Repulic or Kopitan in a shopping centre.I believe the problem with Newton Circus is that green tourists staying in Orchard Road hear about it and head there where they are easily manipulated into paying through the nose for second rate food.My advice: get on the MRT to Raffles Place and head to Lau Pa Sat Pavillion. Cheaper, better and far more authentic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",disappointing,20,20 October 2012,Be very careful when ordering seafood of any kind as they price it by weight per 100 Grams. This can turn out very expensive if you do not insist on the cost beforehand. We have not been back since we took friends over 2 years ago. One the up side the FRESH juice outlets are excellent value.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre - Just okay tourist trap,30,15 October 2012,We bring guests there when they come if it is a short visit - lots to eat in one location. But the stall hawkers can be really aggressive (for one who lives there) and the prices astonishing. Plus all of the high school aged kids drinking while still in school uniforms is off-putting
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique Singapore Hawker Flavour,50,1 October 2012,"The diversity of the hawker ambient is unique. Price of the food is more expensive than a regular hawker, however the superb variety and food quality offered by the hawkers gave Newton a deserving and accliamed reputation."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere,50,30 September 2012,"Great food, when you arrive a 'helper' attaches himself to you, he then finds you a table, a menu, drinks and brings back what ever you want! Great experience and a bit different as well"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,30,31 August 2012,Hawker Food and price for tourists and foreigners and visitors to Singapore. Much better at other Hawker Centers.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food but nothing to shout about,30,26 August 2012,"This place was great 15 years ago but today, it is just another hawker centre. With so many newer food courts in town and in almost all shopping malls, Newton Hawker Centre has lost its appeal. Today it is spacious and fairly clean, with lots of seating and parking available. But I agree with the other reviewers that there is not a lot of choice as every hawker seems to be offering the same dishes. If you're in the area and need a meal, by all means visit Newton Hawker Centre. But it is not worth going out of your way to have a meal there. Just make sure you check on the price of the dish you want to order first to avoid problems later on."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great fun!,40,26 August 2012,"This is a must visit. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. Lots of choice, worth a wonder round to see everything on offer. Pick a table, then go buy your drinks and food. Top tip: agree a price before ordering anything priced on weight. Try the chili crab, peppered squid, and the jumbo prawns."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nothing special,30,20 August 2012,"Went to this food centre yesterday for dinner. spacious open space, not so smoky but once you stepped in the area, there will be a few people help you to look for empty tables and they'll bug you after that with their food menu. It's good for their service but frankly speaking i don't like to be forced to order their food because of that. Food was okay, could say that every stall cooks same types of food, a bit pricy. Overall, it's just another food hunting spot for tourists? "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but tricky hawker owners,40,20 August 2012,Great variety of seafood choices but be sure to at least have a good indication of the prices. Hawkers at Newton Hawker Centre is well trained in tricking tourists into expensive dishes or ridiculous price calculations. A seafood meal for two should not exceed SGD$60.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",For a quick taste of Hawker and local food,40,16 August 2012,"Yes, its a touristy and yes some elements are more expensive however if you want a quick look at Hawker style food, all sorts of local SE Asian cuisane, in a relatively family friendly enviroment then go Newton. Just as long as you dont take it all too seriously is a nice place to go. Restaurant owners will always annoy you however this is Asia and it happens, English is no problems.We go quite often when we feel like jsut getting out for a quick eat.We normally take a bottle of wine with us to eat as well and buy a beer to start then crack open some wine and they generally are OK with it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive hawker fare,20,16 August 2012,it is generally a rip off place and prices are beyond almost any other hawker centres in Singapore. Gives tourists a bad impression of Singapore.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",RE: don't think healthy food,30,9 August 2012,an assortment of local foods... watch out for the prices... ask for the price before purchasing...the place gets crowded in the night but the food is not that great...
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun experience but be savvy about seafood prices,40,7 August 2012,"A fun dining experience is to be had here. The hassle from restaurant proprietors is a bit overwhelming, so best to research and know which one you're going to.Singapore chilli crab was magnificent! Also had lobster. Check total price before agreeing to buy seafood. $6 per 100g sounds cheap but when you get brought over a kg lobster which you weren't expecting, it can get a bit pricier than anticipated.But overall such a fun experience. And did I mention the Singapore chilli crab ??"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Food,40,3 August 2012,This was a fun and easy night with our guests from Australia. Food was great and atmosphere was good too
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cant get enough,50,3 August 2012,We loved it all especially the variety of dishes and the very very cold beer to wash it all down. An absolute must for all travellers to Singapore or rest assured you will feel that you have missed out on a spectacular culinary experience.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Centre of hassle,20,1 August 2012,The food was as expected (good) but the stall owner were a hassle - and confusion remaed about the pricing.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, cheap eats!",40,1 August 2012,"We were recommended to go there, we had great food but wished we had of been stronger to stop Restaurant owners approaching you (although there are signs that say they cannot). It all looks good but you have to enjoy the hawker style eating outdoors to feel comfortable. It would be even better if you could speak their language! I wished we had eaten at the Crab place but maybe next time. Taxi to get home to Hotel was a bit of a wait. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Mix,30,30 July 2012,"If you are just visiting for a short time, and you want one place that has all the signature Singapore dishes, this is it. You do get hassled by Spruikers pushing their stalls, best to ignire them."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,20,26 July 2012,"The closest hawker centre to the tourist belt but expensive and the food is not as good as elsewhere. If you really want to try better food, Go to Lau Pa Sat. A cab ride is cheap compared to other big cities. Of if you're really adventurous, then a true blue hawker centre like Tiong Bahru market is a good bet."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Food,40,24 July 2012,Some really good Asian food here. Chilli crab was delicious. Not cheap but reasonably priced for and cold beer. Worth a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Posh Hawker center,50,23 July 2012,"among all hawker centers in Singapore, this is the most posh place. Food are great but be prepared cos its a little more pricey compared to the others."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",No variety.,10,23 July 2012,Selling similar food at almost 3/4 of all stalls. Ripped off and average quality food even local don't patronise!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gerat but be aware of what you need to do,40,22 July 2012,"This is a Singapore must do. But there are a few rules:1. NEVER listen to the touts as you come in, just smile and nod, if they touch you just say ""molest!!"", they will back off,2. Get a table, leave someone there and go around alook for food,3. the drink sellers will come to your table - buy from them but check the price first - they all speak english, if they dont, then order from someone who does,4. NEVER buy from food touts - they will cheat your blind on price and demand S$ 45 per prawn or something ridiculous - these guys prey on stupid tourists,5. NEVER order unless you have an agreed or signboarded price,6. If you have any hassles, then get the stall number or the touts number. If they become agressive, call 999 and the police will come. I have called 999 many times and the cops here are excellent at sorting this thing out. Just DO NOT BECOME AGGRESSIVE OR SWEAR/OATH.My personal favourite is Ah Hengs carrot cake - it is a good mate and he knows all the people there. Just remember that it is a game for the touts etc. just smile and ignore them. But be careful of some of the local partons especially late at light. They can be very nasty.Selamat makan...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too expensive for normal food.,10,19 July 2012,Im in a F & B business. The food that Newton Hawker offer are too much expensive and food are just so-so. I can find better food all around Singapore at a cheaper rate.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,50,17 July 2012,The food was very fresh and reasonably priced and extremely tasty and the beer was very cheap. I would certainly eat here again
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,30,17 July 2012,Nothing special about this so say Singapore's once tourist attraction nite makan place. look like just another hawker center in town center......
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap? NOT! Quality at a good price!,50,15 July 2012,"Most people will say that Newton Hawker Centre is a tourist’s trap. But I highly beg to differ. Unless you’re looking to have shark’s fins soup and abalone, almost every other thing that you can find there is of a fixed price. Just check before you order and you should be fine. I’d actually think of this place as a place offering one of the better quality seafood in town, because with so much competition, you’d have to stand out in order to survive!One thing to note, the minute you enter the hawker centre, you’ll be bombarded by tones of people holding menus from all the various stalls, touting business from their prospective customers – you. They will try to be nice and offer to find you seats, but most of the time it will be somewhere near their stalls so that you’d buy from them after being seated. Just be firm, the hawker centre IS A FREE SEATING FOOD PLACE like all other food centers around Singapore. You’re free to sit where you want to sit, and eat from whichever stalls you’d want to order from. Don’t feel pressured; just tell the people nicely that you do not need their help.If you’re unsure (because all menus look the same, and every other stalls sell the same barbeque seafood lookalikes), look out for this A1 logo at the A1 Seafood near the carpark entrance. I’m a regular at this stall, and I can guarantee you that the lady boss is one of the most honest stall owners that I’ve seen around. Just look out for this lady with big brown hair and a huge smile. Everything on the menu is priced at standard fixed prices, so fret not (maybe except Crabs that’s by-the-kilogram and prawns are slightly pricier – only because these types of seafood are naturally expensive to begin with). The quality of the food is also consistent and tasty. I especially recommend the Seafood Fried Rice, the Sambal Stingray (Stingray with Chilli), Sambal Kangkong, Sambal Sotong (Squid), and the Chilli Clams. Also, do order their Garlic King Prawns if you have a bigger budget for dinner. If you’re not a huge fan of spiciness, you can always ask the lady boss to recommend you some of the stall’s specialties and she’ll find what’s best for you.If I cannot convince you any further, let my images do its job. But whatever the case, A1 is probably one of the more patronized stalls there (she’s been in this business since before Newton hawker was being renovated, and she has a lot of regulars who patronize her stall all the time.) Although the stall is not registered as a stall providing Halal food, many Muslims still patronize the stall as she uses vegetable oil instead of lard (it’s also a much healthier choice).Other highly recommended stalls are (taking reference from A1 Seafood):- Oyster Omelet (Orh Lua) that’s at the 6 o’clock direction if you’re facing A1, stall 73 – I usually order the $5 “Orh Lua”.- WHITE fried carrot cake from Heng Carrot cake, along the stretch that A1 Seafood is on.- Satay and Popiah that’s at the stretch behind A1 seafood, facing the Carpark (both are at the same stall, and it’s the ONLY stall that sells both Satay and Popiah together)IF you cannot find any of the stalls and want to know which stall is best, just feel free to ask the stall owners at A1. They know which are the best stalls there.Preference for food differs from person to person, but I have frequent gatherings with various groups of friends at Newton Hawker Centre and most of them like the things that I order most of the time, so I have strong confidence that my recommendations are at least of an “above average” standard."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre,30,3 July 2012,"Plenty of local food to choose and try. Famous for grilled seafood , some even halal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Local Food,40,3 July 2012,"Great place to experience local cusine is in the hawker centre. Very wide variety of good food to pick from. Just ensure that you ask for the prices of the seafood before ordering, in case you're over-charged."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food choices keep repeating,20,3 July 2012,"I don't know if it's the management who accept the tenders from food stalls or coincidence, it appears the food and drink selection keep repeating themselves after every 5-6 stalls. There are several stalls offering similar dishes (eg, grilled seafood, fried kway teow/ noodles and even packed drinks). I stopped coming here ever sine my last visit due to the lack of food choices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","""Nice local hawker food with questionable prices for mere hawker food""",30,22 June 2012,"Newton Hawker Centre is a must place for any type of visitor from anywhere in the world when visiting Singapore. A good range of local foods to choose from to truly enjoy what Singapore is all about when it comes to real tasty food. For sea food lovers, be weary when you order the sea creatures for your meal as the hawkers running such stalls will rip you apart when it comes to paying for such a meal. Still, this is the place to enjoy a great meal and lots of beer. Fantastic surroundings with lots of people from different walks of life every other night, makes this a great place to unwind. Go for it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over-rated,over-priced",20,20 June 2012,Locals would generally eat somewhere else. Rowdy drinking crowds late at night. Watch out for over-priced seafood stalls.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at very good prices,50,17 June 2012,The food is great. True Singapore / Asian style hawker food. Although there are many hawker style food places in Singapore. Newton takes the Crown...
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This is a must try.,40,16 June 2012,"My husband and I went to Newton Hawker Centre last Sunday for lunch, and were recommended by this Chinese stall to try their Rojak. Do not be mistaken, this is not the Indian one, but the Chinese style. The Chinese one is quite unique, with pineapple, pear, and you tiao. The portion is quite big too. :)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent value for money,50,12 June 2012,"massive choice of food, we ate here twice and would highly recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An Experience (Good),40,31 May 2012,We found out it is a night center so there was a few hawkers open for a late lunch. The Indian food was very tasting. Visited with the guys working the stand and a random old guy that saw we were tourists. Fun experience and some good food. I was warned later to only purchase food that the price is clearly marked. Some Hawkers were price gouging people. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food all day,40,28 May 2012,"Only a few stalls are open in the morning, but enough variety."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,20,25 May 2012,"Iconic hawker centre, but most certainly a tourist place. A few good stalls but dominated by seafood BBQ stalls that charges exhorbitant prices! Go there for the atmosphere, and stick to non-expensive food like satays, oyster omelettes, fried hokkien noodles etc."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very annoying,10,24 May 2012,"You have people asking you to eat at their stand while walking around looking at menus, very annoying when you try have a nice diner without being pushing around. That's unfortunate this centre used to be a good one. People told me that the high rents that stand owners pay make them ""agressive"" toward getting customers... The food quality has also decreased the last 3 years. Avoid this tourist trap."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food - once you get over the hawkers,40,21 May 2012,"The very aggressive hawkers turned me off at first. But we learned that if you just wave them away (and don't make eye contact (difficult for a friendly country girl)) - they do leave you alone and let you make your choices. You sit at a table near the middle (remember your table number or leave someone there to wave at the hawker so they'll know where to deliver the food). I prefer to order AT each stand - to ensure I know the correct price. We went back a second night - because it was so convenient to where we were staying - and the food was really good, and we had no difficulty at all. The Black Carrot Cake is delicious (warning to the novice: no carrots; not cake). And I love the pointy chicken wings: I'm going to make them that way at home from now on. It was great watching the plates that the locals had delivered. Next time maybe we'll be more courageous."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive hawker food,20,16 May 2012,"Overpriced, overrated hawker food. You are better off visiting Lau Pa Sat"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap,20,13 May 2012,"Need I say more? Touting, pressure to buy from certain stores, over-priced food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated,10,12 May 2012,"The food there is good, however, prices over there are way above the usual prices. Try other local hawker centres such as ""Chomp Chomp"" at Serangoon Gardens, Adam Road Food Centre or Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The food at these places are comparable to Newton Hawker Centre, in fact, some might say better, and the best thing is, its prices are cheaper and more..authentic. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still as good as ever....,50,12 May 2012,"Haven't been to Newton Circus for roughly 10 years and although they have done it up, all for the good, it was still sensational. The food and service were exceptional, thorougly enjoyable and we will always come back to NC....."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Hawker Centre - overpriced,30,10 May 2012,"Reasonable food, but overpriced relative to other hawker centres in SG"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not worth your money,20,9 May 2012,Over priced hawker fare. You can get much better hawker food at other places. Newton Hawker Centre is meant for tourist.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too pricy,10,8 May 2012,The place only interested in tourist. Avoid those hawkers selling BBQ seafood.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not the best Hawker,20,8 May 2012,"The price too expensive, bit over price, I know better hawker center and better food... this is too touristy... and the price is too expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Happening Newton :)),40,7 May 2012,"conveniently located near newton mrt . 3 mins to orchard road.
U can enjoy all local food here. Is a must come place for tourists.
Enjoy our satay, bbq sting ray , fried kway teow, Hokkien prawn noodles etc etc :))"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,30,6 May 2012,"Newton Hawker Centre may be worth visiting as a tourist, if you want to see what hawker centres are like, but as someone living in the city, I feel it is over-rated and very expensive. I avoid visiting it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Ikan Bakar, seafood and drink",40,5 May 2012,I like the open air atmosphere for group meeting with my friends for food and drink.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good easy food,40,4 May 2012,Found a stall on the outside as inside it was too noisy. Got on well with the stall holder who returned the favour every time we visited. Food was good and relatively reasonably priced. Beer price was the same as it was 10 years ago.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker experience: things you should know!,30,3 May 2012,"After the cab dropped us off at the center we were a bit overwhelmed by the activity. Here are some tips that I wish I had known 1. Be ready to be approached by all vendors particularly the high margin seafood vendors2. Take your time, walk around and find a seat near a stall that appeals to you. They will bring the food to your dedicated table.3. keep in mind that the seating area is a public space, and not owned by the seafood guys who will thrust a menu in your face. If you want satays, sugar cane juice and beers only, then no problem; no obligation to order from them.4. If you want the seafood which is indeed fresh, be sure to inspect it checking for size of claws and have it weighted. I was missing a gigantic claw, they just shrugged and walked away.5 . Aside from the missing claw, we had lots of fun and enjoyed this experience.Next time I will try Maxwell hawker center for greater authenticity and less wheeling dealing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Never again,10,2 May 2012,Lots of touts with overpriced items. Good for tourists though but not for the natives since quality of food is just passable. Nothing great.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad choice of plce to savour local Singapore food,20,30 April 2012,Touristy and expensive. Stalls basically sells the same things.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",where locals & tourists alike get scalped,20,25 April 2012,"Tiger Beer 600ml @ Sing$7, Erdinger 500ml @ $7.80...Roti Prata @ $2.80 per piece, Prawn noodle @ Sing$5-10 per bowl, bah kut teh (ditto) have all gone up in prices... I ate a bowl of Bee Hoon soup at Stanley Market in Hong Kong for HK$16=Sing$2.80. I couldn't believe the price, I ordered another bowl of bee hoon soup. Danish beer 300ml in HKG @ Sing40cents (you read that correctly, bro)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant hawker food court,50,24 April 2012,"A great experience and amazing food - too much choice. Catch the 196 bus to Newton Circle/Circus and have a feast - cold beer, cheap food, great choice and a lot of fun. A touch of ""old Singapore"", hawker-style."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Food and great service,50,20 April 2012,This was the best food and atmosphere we experienced for food in Singapore. The quality and price of the street food with the comfort of a restaurant
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","2 separate visits within a week, both great",50,17 April 2012,"There are lots of negative reviews on TA regarding this place with most seemingly written by Singaporeans. I guess it's the same as most cities - the locals have their favourites that may be off the beaten track and tend to avoid touristy places - we do the same at home in Perth.That said, we ate at Newton twice in a week and both times went to shop #46. Mr Liang looked after us both times.On both occasions we had 1kg black pepper crab, 1kg chilli crab, buns, fried rice (1 x chicken + 1 x seafood) plus a small serving of half-cooked cockles. The price on both occasions was a bit over SGD$80 for the food plus another SGD$18 for drinks. Maybe that is a lot for Singaporeans but for us, from Australia, we thought it good value for the excellent products we received.We can offer no recommendations for anywhere other than shop #46 (and the drinks shop next door, #45??) but we have no hesitation in recommending shop #46. Ask for Mr. Liang and say that we sent you!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, reasonable prices, wide variety :-)",50,16 April 2012,"If you like to try lots of dishes and south east asian cuisines, then Newton is the place to go. It's very clean with really tasty food but it's not air-conditioned. If you want authenticity at a really reasonably price, then Newton will tick all the boxes. Just bring a big appetite :-)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not a good choice,10,12 April 2012,"Newton Hawker Centre was built up to be a place to go ans sample great food and great prices; I found neither! It was dirty, smelly and not great value. Visit at your own peril"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Mmmm come here hungry,40,11 April 2012,"I love the way you can walk around all the stalls, browse the menus and then order little tidbits from each vendor which comes delivered to your open air table. On a lovely breezy evening, you can sip a fruit cocktail or cold beer and snack on giant grilled prawns, fantastic noodles, char grilled fish aNd loads of satays. Value, quality and great old world atmosphere..real Singapore "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",I THINK,20,3 April 2012,"it's quiet expensive. I'm still student. I don't have enough money. For me, I just can go sometimes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,10,2 April 2012,Newton Hawker Centre serves mediocre local food at cut-throat prices sold by aggressive stall holders. It is one place I would avoid.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",tourist trap!,10,2 April 2012,You will not find any locals eating there and it is mostly tourists who have no idea about the local prices. Do not get conned. Ask for prices and then order!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touts are still bad news,20,27 March 2012,"We are locals so we were careful not to be fleeced. But the American guy sitting at the next table was not so lucky. We overheard him questioning the stall helper about his $72 bill for five prawns. Granted, these were big prawns, but $72??? The food is nothing to shout about either. Go only when you're in the vicinity and hungry. Definitely not worth going out of your way to visit this. Lots of better, cheaper and more authentic hawker food in many other places in Singapore. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",GREAT FOOD!,50,25 March 2012,The food there is really good and I love it. Their sauce is very full of flavour and it really makes the food look more appetising as well. I like the dessert best!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker Gone Wrong,10,22 March 2012,"Where is the Newton Circus Hawker Center of yore? Where a bowl of the best Indian Mee Goreng was $1.80? A plate of over fried anything starts at SGD$ 22 for a small plate, and by local standards, that's more than extortion. It's so sad that that whole area has been gutted out and re-fitted - the old one epitomised what Singapore food fare had to offer and in its own unique setting. Sadly, that's all gone now and I hear the beautiful back and whites are also headed for the demolition derby. I bid a tearful adieu to an area that all Singaporeans have great memories of."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for Seafood!,30,21 March 2012,"As a local, this is a great place to come for seafood and a beer. It has a busy and noisy ambience, making it great for people spotting. However, the stall owners and touts can very pushy and bothersome, despite attempts to prevent such actions. The 1/2 dozen entrances/exits are also permanently 'manned' by smokers meaning you can't get in or out without a lung full of second hand smoke."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Classic hawker food,50,21 March 2012,"Great all-round hawker food experience. Food is good and reasonably priced (though make sure you check prices in advance with the vendors!)
Great dish to try is the chilli stingray available at most of the seafood vendors."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey but brilliant atmosphere,40,20 March 2012,"A little more expensive than other hawker centres, but well worth it for the atmosphere. Seafood dishes can be very expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","excellent, especially Indian Palace!",50,19 March 2012,"best hawker centre in Singapore. Murtabak from the north indian stall and a lot fo good seafood stalls are highlights. special mention also for bangkok express too. by far and away the best stall is the Indian Palace though. this stall is manned by a charming family who seem to have limitless smiles and excellent service. Their curry is simply brilliant and easily on a par if not better with michelin starred curry houses I have visited in London. this guy really deserves all the praise he gets. We're repeat customers and currently working our way down the menu. inexpensive and consistently delicious, it's the best place i've eaten at in Singapore. top notch!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Big selection of food; bring Singapore cash,40,18 March 2012,"Huge selection of food, you will find what you want. I want to echo and earlier reviewer who stated to look where the locals are lining up to find the best food.  Can get a good plate of food for around $3 - $4, not counting your drink(s), which generally will have to be purchased at a separate shop within the center. Also purchased a fresh fruit smoothie at a shop for around $2.Note to US travelers: They don't want US currency or credit card; walk across the street and pull out $20 Singapore from the ATM and you should be good. Those staying for a period of time in Singapore might find this advice silly, but those on layovers sometimes overlook it."

I mean... if you just want a quick meal and get out, no problem there. BUT, if you want to enjoy an evening having some of our beloved local food, this is the wrong place to head to. Avoid this place if you are a tourist and want to have some decent seafood at a fair price. They are just 'sharpening their knives' and waiting to rip you off the moment you get there!!! And if you are a local.... what are you doing there? At least thats what i am thinking after my last outing there!"

However, when I went with my mom to a particular Malay stall in December 2011, my mom complained that we waited the food for over 10 to 15 minutes, but the lady boss just told my mom to be patient. After that remark, my mom and I never go back to that stall again."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lunch, dinner, late night",40,22 February 2012,"Always good food during the entire day. Fun thing of these places is, that if they do not have good food, they go out of business in several weeks, they have to keep up with the quality of competition which is huge at newton hawker center. It's a clean hawker center as well, like this one"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go!,10,19 February 2012,The place is run by a mafia of aggressive hawkers who charge $500 per chilli crab.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lively, noisy, fun - and terrific food",50,19 February 2012,"Singapore's hawker centres are one of the city's joys; great food at very cheap prices. Newton is well-established, with plenty of choice: chilli Crab, black pepper crab (even better than chilli crab!) and Tiger prawns. The place may look chaotic but it's not: grab a table (and remember its number), then cruise past the various stalls and choose your dinner; it will be delivered to your table swiftly. A really great way to enjoy the local food, with plenty of atmosphere."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey.,20,13 February 2012,"Prices and services are tourist orientated. Most locals avoid here since you can get the same at other hawkers at half the price.
Not recommended unless you stay across the street and do not have time to explore other options."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Revamped and better now...,30,9 February 2012,"Years ago I would give only 1 star to this Food Centre. It does not get by with good food. Prices are not exactly cheap too. But it is a one-stop to taste the local delicacies without having to travel to too many places. Having itself near Orchard Road, I suppose the little price increment is a premium the tourists have to pay. For me, I'd only go in the middle of the night if I am in the vicinity and too lazy to think of where to get a bite."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eeeks!,20,7 February 2012,"This place is known for being bad service, overrated, dishonest.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a visit for the experience,40,29 January 2012,"While some comments state this isn’t the best hawker centre in Singapore, we still had a thoroughly enjoyable mealThe downside to the huge choice of stands is that you cannot pass, pause or even look at them without being targeted by their owner. Each outlet is obviously keen to get you to eat at their own establishment. A polite ‘just looking’ does the trick, but only until you venture three steps to the next stall!Eventually we gave up and selected stall No 78, after the owner Margaret went to great pains to explain the menu and process.All the stalls seem to push fish, probably due to it being more expensive. We were given laminated menus with pictures of the food and prices clearly displayed. Most of the dishes came in four sizes, in general small, medium, large and extra large,We ordered a medium fried rice (plenty of prawns in it), a small lemon chicken and a small fried dumpling plate. The latter contained ten decent sized prawn filled dumplings. The three dishes provided more than enough food for two to share.Drinks are ordered separately from vendors that only deal in drinks. You do not need to leave your seat to order – the vendor will find you. All food and drink is paid for at the end of the meal. Cost for the three dishes and a large tiger beer (approx 650ml) was SGD36. Well worth the trouble of a visit"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to eat than at Newton,30,27 January 2012,Newton Hawker center is centrally located with many stalls. Many of the food sold are not that bad but not excellent either. Because tourist do not know of other places to eat - they tend to go to Newton to eat - and pay very high price for the food. In Singapore there are a lot of places to eat - including those food courts in shopping malls and coffee shops. Tourist - I urge you to ask any people in the streets or at your hotel where ELSE you can go to have some local food... and you should be able to find one within 1 to 2 km....
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Used to be a great place, but alas, no longer",20,24 January 2012,"Pushy stall owners, only ok food, and ridiculous prices! Not a place I'd be recommending. Waited more than 25 minutes for our food, then went back to the stall to realise they had lost the order. And when the food arrived, it wasn't anything to write home about."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",you can always find better!,20,23 January 2012,This place is definitely over-rated. Food quality is not fantastic and price is definitely a no-no!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful when ordering,30,21 January 2012,"This is a hawker centre which tourist have become attracted to. Be aware that many of the items on the menu's are sold by their weight, which may not always be obvious. That said most of the food sold, (mainly seafood) is of good quality and flavour.Can be reached by MRT to Newton Circus just one stop from Orchard Road. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,10,20 January 2012,"This is very close to home, but we actually try and suggest to friends not to go there. They are expensive, the Hawkers is not as good as the many others around town - this is an example where they have gained a good reputation through word of mouth or travel books and they don't deserve. If you do decide to go, make sure they don't rip you off on price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The old magic isn't there,20,20 January 2012,"Since it was renovated, most of the shops aren't there anymore and it's hot and it seems like there are just those seafood shops. I don't go anymore and i used to love it. It's cleaner yes... but less messy totally. I feel the food is just not as good. Although the fish ball noodles and fish hat (yu tiao). So have not been back in almost a year!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","It’s a tourist attraction, not a foodie hawker center",30,20 January 2012,"As a native, I wouldn’t say this is the best hawker center around. There are only a handful of good food stalls there but most are average. What makes this hawker center unattractive is the prices. Because it’s a “tourist” attraction, you get higher prices; basically it’s a tourist trap. Don’t be pressure by the touting hawkers. Find a seat and take your time to decide on what you feel like having."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,20,19 January 2012,"If you are a tourist looking for a 'real' hawker centre experience do not go here. The food prices are highly inflated, the touts will drive you crazy and there are other touts who want to sell you sunglasses, watches etc. For a real experience, go to Lau Pa Sat in the financial district, If you are going to lunch you need to get there by 11:45 as the tables fill very quickly. Leave someone at your table to 'mind' it or place packets of disposable tissues at everyone's seats or you may come back to find others sitting in your seats. If you see an 'empty' table with packets of tissues on it, this means that the table has been taken."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good atmosphere, good food",40,18 January 2012,Delicious hawker food and a great atmosphere - well worth the trip
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worst hawker centre in Singapore,10,18 January 2012,"This place is a tourist rip-off, there have been several incidents of people being charged hundreds of dollars for hawker food. Examples may be found in Tripadvisor reviews, as well as a search of past news stories. If you are cheated, you should file an official complaint with the Singapore Tourism Board, they have successfully taken one of the stalls at Newton to court before on behalf of a tourist who was cheated.If you want a good Hawker Centre experience try Chomp Chomp, Lau Pa Sat, Maxwell Road Food Centre, East Coast Park Food Centre, or just about any other hawker centre in Singapore for a more authentic experience and better food. Ask Singaporeans for recommendations, just about anyone will be willing to share their advice on this topic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the touts!,30,17 January 2012,"It's quite touristy and the prices reflect it. It's more expensive than going to Lau Pa Sat or a smaller local place, but the food is good. Always cheaper than a proper restaurant, just prepare to get hassled by the stalls as you walk past. The best bet is to just walk around the whole place and look at each stall to see what you want to get - don't let the hawkers get too pushy - if you tell them no then they should leave you alone. Check prices before you order - especially things like crab which are done by weight. Confirm what size you'll be charged for."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",If you're tired of the regular restaurants...,40,14 January 2012,"... Newton Hawker Centre is the place to visit, to walk around, have a look, chose, sit down under the open sky without any aircon & enjoy simple but tasty food.The food was okay, not of the quality as JUMBO seafood east cost, but okay. & the atmosphere is unique, especially when all the year you've to eat in 5* hotels, posh restaurants.Another bonus: it's open very late.We loved it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, great atmosphere, great fun!!",50,13 January 2012,"We went to this place twice a couple of weeks back. Saturday night is great fun with lots of people getting down for a feed. You can get cheap eats as well as tasty (but more expensive) seafood. Just for people watching alone its worth a visit.We walked around on the first night and were stopped by one lady who was probably one of the best saleswomen I've ever come across! She got her cook to whip up some awesome chilli crab and veggies.It wasn't super cheap but it was super tasty. The second time we went back we ended up going to her again and she looked after us really well, cooking up some thai style sea bass.I dont know her name or stall number but if you approach from newton MRT station you cross over the pedestrian bridge to get to newton hawker centre, when you enter via the bridge, turn right and walk up beside the stalls, after about 15-20 stalls you'll probably get stopped by this woman. She's great!Happy eating!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Take care in ordering and enjoy,40,13 January 2012,"This place is now a bit of a tourist trap - but you can still get good, cheap food if you are careful. If you are going to order any seafood - make sure you know how much they propose to charge upfront. The fried kuay teow is always good value and delicious, as is the chilli stingray. Wash it down with some chilled tiger beer and you have a perfect late night meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",bad,10,7 January 2012,"overpriced, too much touting and not much good food. it servers more like a tourist destination than a place for locals. i would definitely not recommend this to anyone. the only stall i wouldn't mind having is the XO ba chor mee, but i wouldn't take the effort to go there just to have that."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Centrally located hawker center with pricey tags.,20,2 January 2012,Newton has a good variety of local delights that comes with higher-than usual price tags. You wouldn't see much local Singaporeans at this hawker center.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",a cultural experience,50,31 December 2011,"We went there with local people, and, although they claim the area is touristic, I could find it quite singaporean.... Loved it! Lovely food and really cheap. Try the crabs...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food but $$,30,28 December 2011,"Favour of tourist where you can try all sorts of local food, but over priced and know to charge tourist prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good but overpriced,40,24 December 2011,"Newton Hawker Center is probably the most well known Hawker Center in Singapore (at least by the tourists). There are an excellent variety of foods at Newton and the quality is very good. I however would recommend other places such as Glutton's Bay near the Esplanade, or Lau Pa Sat for the scenery and location. If you are near then by all means go but it does not warrent a special trip."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A little overrated?,30,23 December 2011,"I know this is one of “the” Hawker Centre’s in Singapore and, to be honest, I did use to really enjoy this place. It all depends on your expectations. It’s in a good location, and does serve pretty good local foods. A nice introduction to the Singapore Hawker experience.For tourists, it’s definitely one of the nicer looking centres in Singapore… leafy, open, green and secluded from the traffic. Plus the stone floor is attractive and, of course, very clean. But, the downside is that the choices are very limited. And, depending on your expectations, a little expensive.Most of the stalls specialize in seafood. I don’t particularly like seafood, which leaves with me one or two BBQ meat stalls. These are fine (and actually much cheaper than seafood), but you can get BBQ meats in almost every street corner in Singapore!So, like I said… it depends on your expectations. I still recommend this place to tourists, but don’t come here so much myself anymore.Tips: be forceful with the touts… if you really don’t want what they are offering (i.e. their table, their drinks, their food, their napkins etc…) just tell them. And please take a look at the signs giving advice on the pricing… those visual signs do a much better job of describing the correct “haggling process” than I could!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,30,23 December 2011,Not delicious as before. food are generally overpriced.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic indian food,50,3 December 2011,We went here twice because of the excellent indian food. Fast service. Try also the desserts. Hawker Centre easy to reach by metro from everywhere.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap but great,50,28 November 2011,"The only places to eat and enjoy true local cuisine are the hawker centres, my first choice every time"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ask the price before you order!,30,22 November 2011,"We went to Newton on recommendation of the taxi driver- it looked a fun place to go, as it was, very evocative of the amosphere of Singapore. There were many ""trawlers"" trying to lure you to their tables- we were seduced by giant barbecued garlic prawns and chilli crab- which were delicious and we enjoyed- until we recieved the bill! 144Sin$ for a meal for two with plastic plates and knives and forks. Left feeling somewhat taken for a ride. The Singaporeans have heard that this place is expensive, the system seems to be go round to the stalls and pay as you go, do not accept what is brought to you and then pay later!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",V Good Food,40,2 November 2011,It's a little like walking through the post tourist attraction gauntlet but the food is quite good. The section we sat at would grab food from a few different vendors so it worked well. Worth the trip over. Just a short walk from the Newton Metro station. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night might be different,40,17 October 2011,"I was there during lunch hours, and quite a few of the vendors were closed. I ordered a BBQ stingray and it was pretty good. It was about 12SGD. The place was clean and nice but hopefully a night experience would have been better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker centre to avoid if you can,10,15 September 2011,"This place is more for tourists and locals will avoid if they could. Foods are so-so and pricey. You have other better hawker centres elsewhere than this, where foods much tasty, better and cheaper.Hawkers here when they see locals walking in, they do not bother, knowing that they cannot ripped them off unlike tourists. So tourists be warned.If you wanted to try local foods, there are many hawker centres around the island, that sell the same things what Newton centre offered. You do not need to come here to try.Chances of tourists getting ripped off here is high, which has been proven on newspaper."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,40,14 September 2011,"Located just off Orchard Road, Newton Hawker Centre is an easy stop for tourists wanting to experience eating outdoors, hawker centre style. The likes of sambal sting-ray, satay, sugarcane juice, mee goreng etc are available albeit at somewhat higher prices. As you approach the hawker centre, many of the stall owners will approach you to ask you to order food from them. You are not obliged to sit down directly. Take your time and have a look around. Look at the dishes on the tables of those who are already eating at the stalls. That should give you an idea of what's good or not and the portion sizes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated and annoying touts,20,16 August 2011,"With so many great places to eat in Singapore, Newton Hawker Centre should be avoided. Lots of pressure to buy overpriced items, particularly seafood. There are many other places in Singapore where you get better food, at better prices, in a more pleasant atmosphere."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,30,7 July 2011,"Having grown up in Malaysia and being a keen cook, I like to think that my palate is quite educated in terms of Malaysian/Singaporean cuisine. We went to Newton Hawker Centre on the recommendation of a hotel staff member. From the start, you feel pressured by the touting. As you arrive, scouts from the various seafood stalls will spot you as tourists and notice your helplessness as you look around for an empty table. Having found you one, they push their menu onto you and, being a pushover, I feel obliged to order something from them. We had an oyster omelette (good), satay (tiny skewers, chewy beef), BBQ skate (tasty but greasy), fried rice and koay teow (both tasteless and rather devoid of protein or vegetable matter). I do concede that we might not have sampled food from the best stalls and that I may be making sweeping generalisations, however, even the food we had from the Kopitiam food court in Vivo City was much better in both taste and variety, and also cheaper. The other thing that detracts is that you have to use flimsy plastic cutlery that gets caught by the strong gusts from the strong oscillating fans, often showering you in food. Also, we were told that there wouldn't be a problem getting back to the hotel as there is a taxi stand there, but this is not the case. Most of the cabs that were dropping off passengers seemed to be enroute to some pre-booked destination. It took us 45 minutes to finally hail down some cabs that hadn't been pre-booked. All in all, an over-rated and disappointing experience. The night after that, we went to Chinatown and had a fantastic meal, both in taste and value. Note that this is in the food court (level 2 of the market building) and not in Food St, which is pretty but looks even more of a tourist trap than Newton. In the Chinatown food court, there are extensive numbers of stalls selling all kinds of foods. Make sure you go early as many were already shut by 8pm."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chinatown is sooo much better,10,30 June 2011,Honestly save your self the disappointment. You will get far better service food and prices in Chinatown
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's not that great!,30,30 June 2011,"This is a place for the tourists, the locals hardly patronise this area, as the food is more expensive than those served at the neighbourhood food centres. Furthermore, the food is not necessarily more delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still a rip-off,30,28 May 2011,"Yep they haven't changed. Coming back to this place after years. Last time I was here, there was an older chinese woman throwing up on the table. In spite of the 'no touting' signs the place crawls with them. The quality of the food is average at best. It is arguably possible to have a good dinner there while beating off the touts and trying to make sure you're not getting ripped off. But why bother? There are better places in Singapore and I for one will not be coming back."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious hawker foods at good prices and location!,40,23 May 2011,"Although some locals do not recommend this hawker centre because it's touristy or a little bit more pricey than other hawker centres, I really like Newton Hawker Centre!Newtown Hawker Centre has a great variety of delicious local foods at cheap prices and it opens until very late. Because I always stay around Newton/Novena area whilst in Singapore, this place is handy for me. Especially sometimes I only stopover in Singapore for 1-2 days only and I always come by here and then I'd check out Mustafa 24 hour shopping centre afterwards since it's quite close.Do not worry about the vendors wanting you to buy foods at their stalls, and take your time looking around at places you fancy. Also, do not be fooled by the stall's owners. Once, my partner was tricked into buying this jumbo prawns (they're really huge because they're bigger that your computer mouse!) and they're really expensive and not worth it. Also, remember to look for A-grade stalls (they will have big A. B, C rated) for the cleanest stalls."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Watch out for touts, avoid the seafood!",40,19 May 2011,"This place is usually highly recommended on books and guides, however, as a local, I'd strongly advise tourists from having seafood at the stalls in this hawker centre. Better seafood at much better value can be found at other hawker centers around Singapore. However, newton hawker centre indeed serves well as a late night, supper place full of local cuisine that is of decent quality. Try the duck noodles, Cheng tng stalls over at the row of stalls facing the car park."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",will visit again,40,19 May 2011,"I'm somekind of hard to pleased, but I find this restaurant a really good one. Its food was good. My family liked it very much. Its staff were friendly and well-trained also. They're politeness. There is one thing I adjust is that, the restaurant should improve its facilities to create a warmer atmosphere, so that guests could enjoy the food in better backdrop."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome as ever,50,29 April 2011,"This is the first time I have returned to Newton since it's renovation a few years back. I have to say I like it still. The food choices are great and I really enjoyed the cha kue teow, bbq chicken wings, oyster omelet, po piah, kang kong belachan and roast duck...and tiger prawns grilled with garlic.The only thing I didn't really care for is that the vendors kept chasing me as I look like an angmoh (even though i grew up in KL and Sing) and am Eurasian. They left my relatives alone as they looked more local I suppose. No big deal though."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for family,40,19 April 2011,"The prices at Newton are several times higher than at neighborhood hawker centers. Nevertheless our family enjoys coming here, the kids like it. Usually a boisterous, friendly environment. Several can't-lose dishes such as pepper beef and chicken rice that the kids vacuum up. We always get lime juice to drink from one of the many drink vendors. The kids also like to practice with chop sticks. Although Newton is priced for tourists, the majority of the customers seem to be locals."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",FANTASTIC FOOD (We are brits who live round the corner from it and go all the time),50,3 April 2011,"This serves consistently tasty and very fresh seafood. Stingray, pepper crab and kang kong (green veg) are our must haves every time we come. Great value for money. Pick your own crab to get the size you want. You must try the laksa sold by the first hawker on the right as you go in the main entrance. The place is filled with locals every night. Plus a few expats like us."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Far better than I'd anticipated,40,20 March 2011,"I had heard this was a bit of a tourist trap, but was favourably impressed. If the tourists like it, it's for good reason, as the food is really, really good and really, really cheap. We were the only westerners the afternoon we went though. The centre is nice to look at, a large wooden structure surrounded by greenery. It's arranged in a circular pattern of food stalls, very clean, with outdoor seating areas under overhead ceiling fans. The food is spicy and delicious. Do go and try it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant place,50,28 September 2010,"I have been to Singapore about 5 times and always make a point of going here and I also recommend it to friends/collegues that are visiting.I have a soft spot for this place as I went to uni in Singapore for 6 months about 14 years ago. The old Newton Circus hawker centre was bonkers. Lively atmosphere and less than impressive toilet facilities but the food was cheap and plentiful and the beer was also cheap and icy cold. All you could ask for as a student. Now I am all grown up, I made a poin of going to the new Newton hawker centre as I had read the old centre has been knocked down and moved accross the road. It is all nice and a lot cleaner, no smoking and its covered so it doesnt matter if it is raining. The toilets are a million percent better. But the food and the beer are exactly the same. Great. Dont be put off my anyone trying to make you sit at their stall. Just walk around till you see something you like and order it.We always go around stall 46 as we made friends with a guy calle Po who will do anything for you. He sits you down and you dont have to worry about anything. You order everything from him and he goes to the different stalls to arrange everything for you. You just pay the different people when they come. Satays are 0.50 singapore cents each which is 25p in UK money or 2.50HKD. Po's stall does the best stingray with a spicy and tasty sauce. The stall next to his does cheap and ice cold bottles of tige beer. Its simply great and ideal for couples, large groups of friends or families. I wish there were places like this in Hong Kong. This place makes me want to live in Singapore. Open from 4pm til 4am. Easy to get to on the MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",awesome nightout!,40,7 August 2010,"We walked there from where we staying. We stayed around orchard road. It was about 15-20 mins walk. We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab! Crabs are about SG$3.50 per 100g at this place. There are about 50 stalls open at that time making it very hard to choose which stall you want your food from. The service was excellent from Pirate Seafood Stall! The guy Jason served us..he was excellent! I also tried the sambal pari/stingray.. it was nice! At 12am midnight, the place is still rocking..lots of crowds..awesome night out!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton has changed slightly,40,5 July 2010,"I just came back from Singapore again on a work trip, as usual the local colleagues brought me to Newton Food Centre on my final night there. I dreaded it a little because in previous visits, I always get swarmed by hawkers who are all selling the same dishes, BBQ Seafood, and then some.This time, things have changed. Shops between No. 56-66 give you a less stressful dining experience there. The drinks store owner told me the current talking point is this store No. 64 that sells nasi lemak, or coconut milk rice, a local favourite for breakfast lunch dinner and supper. Turns out, the owner is a fine young lad who's a Masters' holder, used to be a GM of some MNC and drived a Merc SLK Convertible. Gave it all up to follow his hobby and passion.I do not know about you, but to give up an SLK Convertible, damn this guy is insane. Well, the nasi lemak i had was very pleasant. It was rather light, and had many interesting dishes to go with the rice, curry chicken, curry pork, and some peranakan dishes as well. It was a fulfilling meal together with the other favourites like fried prawn noodles and carrot cake. I have to say, if you do visit singapore and go to newton, do visit the row of shops i mentioned, No. 56-66. Very enjoyable, and you get a fine young lad serving you nasi lemak, THAT was the highlight of my recent trip, to Singapore, and to Newton Food Centre"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hidden Gem - Malay Coconut Rice & Curries,40,6 June 2010,"I was in Singapore for a week with my wife and we went to Newton Food Centre near our hotel. I had previously read up about the types of food there and noticed most of the stalls served very similar foods - BBQ seafood, oyster omelette, carrot cake... For a first timer we sampled some of this and it was very good. A few nights later, a local friend took us there again for dinner and this time amidst all the BBQ seafood stalls, we had the pleasure of trying some truly splendid and different food that was not aimed at the tourist community. Our friend recommended that we try the food at this stall Curry Nasi Lemak (No. 64), a traditional malay coconut rice and assorted curries and fried foods. And we were really taken by surprise by the flavours. If you are ok for spicy foods, give this stall a try. We had curry chicken which was awesome, a dried beef curry, spring rolls, and a really fantastic honey sesame chicken which isn't always available (as told by the stall owner). You can request for it, and they'll whip up a hot fresh portion for you. Coated with a black honey sauce and toasted sesame seeds on top, about US$1 per piece. I'm from the States and the asian restaurants don't come close to the flavours and spices used here. Prices are a fraction of what you would pay at the BBQ stalls, a dish costing about US$2 each versus US$30-US$50 at the BBQ stalls. Give it a try if you are looking for something different and authentic flavours, and not targeted at tourists. Mostly local people eat there.Beware though, their homemade chilli sauce is amazingly spicy... but full of flavour. Hope you find this review useful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","GIve it a go and wear your loosest, lightest clothes-there is no breeze.",40,23 December 2009,"I went last night with boyfriend, we recently moved to Singapore and heard this was a different type of Hawker Centre. It is, it's recently been refurbished so lots of flashing lights and definitely aimed towards tourists. But, if you've only been here a week, (as we have) and have struggled a few times to get what you're after in the very local Hawkers, Newton is a good place to start.Don't be put off by the way the owners try to engage in conversation and get you to check out their menus. It is a bit forceful but, once you take a seat, you can decide what you fancy, every style of food is available, BBQ, lots of fresh Seafood, etc. It can get busy so if you see a good table, grab it.We started by letting this guy show us his menu and asked him what was good, i fancied a Laksa so he fetched me one with cockels, i'd never heard of this type before but it was delicious, shame they used Spaghetti which they seem to do here quite a bit....give me Udon noodles!!Then, he fetched us some Swordfish, warned us that it was spicy, maybe too spicy...we love spicy, it wasn't spicy. I was told, if you ask for a dish 'home style' they will make it with the heat which ordinarilly they'd remove for tourists.We also had a selection of satay sticks and about 4 little cans of Tiger beer each, all for less than $50. The lady selling us the beer actually brought us over a couple of free ones before we left and both she and the guy we initially spoke to made a point of coming over to say goodbye when we were leaving, very sweet and friendly. I would recommend it to anyone."

The vegetable dishes and the carbs were all just ok.What was really bad about this restaurant was the service. The restaurant was understaffed and the waiters were simply overwhelmed. Some of them seemed very uninterested in serving the customers. I had to ask five times for rice and condiments. This needs to be improved.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch,40,10-03-17,"Irish fattened ducks are roasted on site , hence fresh and moist.sweetened Roast pork also features. Rice or noodles and fried vegetables are good too. Prices are reasonable."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Yummy !!!,50,09-27-17,"Ate at the London Fat Duck, our meal was amazing !! Was also very reasonable in price compared to similar restaurants nearby. Would recommend !!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sure is fat and juicy,40,09-14-17,"They live up to their Name. The duck meat is sure fat, juicy and tender. It might not be the best roasted duck ever but it is satisfying enough. Their other dishes are good too, like the roast pork, char siew which is on the fatter side which makes it softer. Service is quick and friendly too."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Standards have dropped ,20,08-18-17,"When this duck outlet first opened, the queues were always very long. It was worth the wait. The roast duck was fabulous and remain consistently good for the longest time.But after a recent visit in July 2017 standards had seriously fallen. And not surprisingly, no queues in sight ! I am forgiving. I will give it one more chance ! Perhaps it was just a bad day for the chef. We shall see. Alan Leong Singapore "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great porridge,50,07-22-17,"Whatever we ordered, everything taste delicious. When skimming the menu outside the door, we were intriqued with pig ear terrine. So we gave it a try and it does not disappoint. However, we ended up ordering two porridges, roasted pork, bbq pork, roasted duck, and radish cake. Ohhh so good. Will come back to taste the pig's ear terrine."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner,50,07-19-17,First time to this outlet but was not a stranger as have visited the other outleta on several occassions. Food did not disappointed me as the quality and taste was exactly the same with the other outlet.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,yummy to the max,50,07-07-17,yummy as always.. nothing can beat the crunchiness and tender of fried duck here.. however they dont provide tissue as they will charge for wet tissue. so pls prepare to bring one.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice spin on roast duck : Dim Sum ,40,07-04-17,Chanced on this in the basement of the high end mall after deciding $26 is too much to pay for a hot dog no matter how hipster the coffee shop is ! As a 'ang mo' local slang for a white guy I'm not an expert on dim sim & roast but you can taste the difference between here and equivalent or even more expensive places. London refers to the imported duck they use and it's a singapore restaurant rather than a franchise of a Hong Kong chain like some others.Overall well worth a try I recommend the pepper duck bau and the roast pork :)
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Food court setting, oustanding duck and pork, peculiar service",40,06-28-17,"The place feels like a mall food court setup. The duck is delicious, the bbq pork belly is crunchy and taste great. Try the pressed pig year (appetizer, cold cut). It looks great sliced and tastes better than it looks.If you have a healthy appetite don't bother with anything less than half duck. It's not as big as it sounds.I was a bit disappointed with the duck tongue appetizer. It comes with the jaw bone attached.I understand this is an Asian restaurant but I thing they could use a few wines on the menu.Service is strange: different wait stuff stops by every once in a while, checks your order (which stays on the table), go away. One of the waitresses did that, then walked two tables away and stared at me while I was eating. I guess she was getting bored, it was late, place was almost empty."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food is good - service and decor average,40,06-12-17,Don't get confused with Hestons London fat duck - the food was good and obviously popular with locals when you see the long queue for takeaway. The decor is tired and a bit scruffy bu the food was good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Nice food, service so-so",40,06-06-17,"We were browsing and wanted to try this place as i wanted to try their roast items. Ordered the three combination, noodles and also some dim sum to try. The combination turn out very well especially the char siew as it had a mix of lean + fat meat on every piece(which is the way i liked my char siew). The black pepper duck bun was also tasty though the downside is that there is little filling (pic attached). The signature steam cheong fun was also good and inside the fritter, there was some prawn/fish paste which gave that food a different texture and taste. They kept the sauce and cheong fun separate instead of pouring the sauce on the cheongfun. Service is somewhat lacking and the staff mixed up our table orders with another's even though it was not full. The place is also pretty simple and felt similar to a crystal jade. Overall, i would probably want to try some of the other dishes to see if this could become a regular hangout."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quite okay,40,06-05-17,"We tried the duck wanton noddle, black pepper bun, quarter duck, charsiew and other dimsum items. All was averagely okay, except for the YUMMY honey charsiew. The duck itself and black pepper bun was quite underwhelming but still nice nonetheless. Not a must return but still an option."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a Hong Kong Style Cuisine,40,05-28-17,"I was confused when I saw the signage. I was remembered of Heston's Fat Duck in London. In fact it's a Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong style. It has plenty menu, and I thinks it's quite alright."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Chance,30,05-20-17,"Nothing great. Pricey. I still prefer Ding Xiao Er. We just gave this craze a chance and will not be coming back for it. There are a lot more cheaper choices with the same quality. If not, same price but better."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London fat duck VivoCity outlet ,30,05-09-17,Duck was good.. the floor of the place is very slippery Becareful is walking in.. food was good the duck and the plum sauce goes very well.. but still abit pricey for me
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty and tender,40,04-22-17,"Had dinner at the vivocity outlet. The duck with salted vegetable soup could have been subtler. Not that it wasn't tasty, but could have held back in the salt a little. Duck noodles was good- tender, succulent duck slices with springy noodles and blanched veges. Service was also not bad given that they were extremely busy during dinner time."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lame London Fat Duck,30,04-18-17,"Tasty no doubt. The duck and the xiao long bao were prepared well. My big concern was the duck serving size. Almost half the duck served was bone. Nothing much to eat. Disappointing. Would have rated it 2 of 5, but the xiao long bao saved the day. Somehow. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nothing great,30,04-08-17,"The decor was nothing great. We ordered the duck pancakes(1/2 a duck), xo fried rice with duck, yeong chow fried rice, hakkaw, prawn spring roles, kai Lan etc. the ladies serving were nice. The food was average for me. In a place like Singapore they really will need to turn up the game to survive. For me it was not a meal to remember!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck was lovely,50,04-05-17,The duck we ordered was perfect. Better tasting than the Peking duck. The staff was very attentive to us. We asked for additional condiments..it was brought to.ia in no time.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Must try 3 meat combination !,50,04-05-17,"We were back there again at their outlet in Vivocity, this time for lunch. My friend was there ahead, so she took a table for 3 of us.Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for a weekday lunch. Service is as usual good and efficient.She has never tried it here, so we ordered our usual favorites, a quarter roast duck and some dim sum. She also wanted to try the other 2 meats, roast pork and char siew. Wow ! The char siew was moist, tender, succulent and tasty ! The roast pork too, n not too saltish ! She also agreed with our verdict of the London Fat roast duck : a ravishing delight.She even brought home the meats, which we couldn't finish. Her parents liked them so much, and said...Not enough for them. LOL.Will be back, to satisfy our craving for roast meats !"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lip smacking stuff,50,03-22-17,"Fatty Char siew. Roast duck. Charcoal buns with peppery duck fillings. I am just going to recommend dishes to try because the food served at this restaurant is nothing short of amazing, my words would not do it sufficient justice. Your taste buds would thank me for it, I kid you not!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck,40,02-12-17,My first visit has left a satisfying impression although the portion of duck served included a fair amount of boney bits. The meaty bits served did taste as good as the famous roast duck restaurant in Bayswater London. A side order of the water cress soup with pork ribs was decidedly flavoursome and the meat well cooked. I will return when I next fancy a London roast duck dinner!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Excellent roast duck,50,01-29-17,Excellent roast duck. That's what this restaurant is famous for. Located at the basement of the Scott Square.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Why not Fat Duck ?,50,01-22-17,"We were wondering why it's called Fat Duck, anyway we went to try it.We tried it at their outlet in Vivo City, basement 2. It was Fri evening, we were there slightly after 6 pm, and lucky to have seats right away.We ordered a quarter roast duck, har kao, siew mai and fu pi quan, and 2 porridge for 4 of us.The duck didn't disappoint, neither did the dim sum, which is by far the best we've tasted in a very long time here in Singapore. The price of the dim sum is the usual restaurant price, so it's really good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch ,40,01-17-17,Famous for its roast duck which comes from Ireland. Rather fat duck but you could easily separate the fat from the meat. Reasonably priced. Good range of other dishes typically Cantonese style food
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just not worth it!,10,12-25-16,"Tried this restaurant for the second time. First time it was when it had just opened and the experience was not good. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and put it down to the teething problems of a business at the start. So, now after some time I decided to give it another try. Bottom line, I shouldn't have done so. Nothing changed. It is still the same terrible food, indifferent service and expensive for what it is. You are certainly better off in every aspect to go to the nearest food court or hawker center."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is good.,50,12-22-16,My table ordered half a duck. It was quite sizable. The roast duck is good. The gravy they pour on it the duck plus the plum sauce were delicious. I like duck and this ranks quite high up on my roast duck list. It is a bit on the fat side. The fat is very adherent to the meat and less so to the skin.The liver porridge was so-so. The pork cheong fun was good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average,30,12-20-16,"Average dimsum restaurant. The only dish i would recommend is Signature black pepper london duck bun. The London roast duck rice was also average too. For dessert, the mango puree with sago is good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Fat duck, inconsistent service ",30,12-17-16,"We wanted a light lunch , hence ordered noodles with duck drum stick (extra $3), fish porridge and a bowl of wanton. Found the quality and taste of food average at most, but the duck drum was quite fatty in my opinion. However, some of the staff seemed to lack experience and worked at a snail's pace. They could improve on their professionalism and work pace. Prices are reasonable for it's Orchard location."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good fatty duck,40,12-16-16,The concept of this restaurant is just like the typical Hong Kong style roasted cuisine. They import their ducks and these ducks are fat. Love the skin of these roasted ducks. They serve good roasted port and char siew too!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated for the Duck,30,12-10-16,"Roast Duck - Nothing special especially for $40 a duck.
I prefer the dim sum. Buns were very tasty. Reasonable and nice.
Service is poor - an older gentleman did all the work."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Surprised ,40,12-10-16,"We went there at 330pm so there wasnt any queue. Ordered half a duck, it was excellent not dry just like how they do it in Beijing. Excellent duck"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Ditch the reservation!,10,12-04-16,"Forget about trying to reserve a table for dinner. The service is useless and overwhelmed on tthe Saturday that we went. Despite making a reservation, no table was available when we got there. while one staff was clearing a table for us, another ushered a different group to the table and ifnored our protests that we had a reservation. In the end we left since the staff werent even interested in making any attempt to accomodate us. I wont even rate this restaurant a one but the app wont let me."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Might've been good,20,11-27-16,"I was by myself, hungry, and only had a short time to eat, so decided to order 2 items for takeout from the dim sum menu. Half an hour later, I was still waiting. Not only was I starving, but I couldn't help but wonder why all the other patrons were getting their dim sum while I was just sitting there watching and waiting for my measly 2 to-go items. They weren't that busy. When I finally got up to inquire, for the second time, and say I was out of time to wait, the woman who took my order rushed into the kitchen and came back with one of the items (the black pepper duck buns) and then grabbed the other item that had been sitting on the counter for at least 20 minutes already, and said they made a fresh batch of the black pepper buns for me. That's nice and all, but the shrimp dumplings that were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes were now ice cold and greasy. It's too bad, I was excited to try this place, but won't give it another shot now."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Won't Queue For This,30,11-21-16,"We went on a weekend and was fortunate we didn't have to queue for a table. The menu is focused mainly on the duck, roast meats, some noodle dishes and mainly dim sum. I wasn't impressed by the quality of the dim sum. The roast meats were better. The famous roast duck is pretty tender and tasty although I do find the duck to be on the skinny side. The food is not too bad but I won't queue for it should I visit the next time. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,No queue,40,10-28-16,Went in on a rainy Friday evening for dinner with my lucky self.Had the duck noodles and the crispy pork. The duck noodles were good. Not a big portion but enough to taste duck and noodles together in one plate. The soup was rather peppery but the duck was tender with some bones to challenge. Noodles were well done. Not too soft yet springy and with good texture. Crispy pork serving was a bit small but all good in taste and the skin was crispy and wafer thin. Best was the chilli dip. Shiok. Not sure why mustard was served with crispy pork. Bad combo.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Family lunch,40,10-20-16,Good spot to stop for lunch while shopping on Orchard Rd. Food and service good and reasonably priced.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sucks !,10,10-20-16,"This is not worth visiting if you are a duck lover. Is a HK joint and most likely operated by mainland chinese in the kitchen.The braised duck wings are salty, salty and salty that's all I could remember. I couldn't even finish the small portion of wings. Simply too salty for my taste. And is the worst I have in my entire life.Regretted and will ever step into this place agian."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,The duck is not fantastic,20,09-26-16,"Ordered the duck bun, chee cheong fun, duck noodles, wanton noodles and duck porridge. But the duck meat is not crispy enough and not fragrant enough. The noodles texture is not bad but very very small portion. The porridge is too plain and tasteless. The chee cheong fun is alright. Prob won;t go back. The beijing duck from imperial treasure beats this ."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delightful duck!,40,09-25-16,"The duck here is delightful and you can have it with rice, noodles and congee. The char siew (pork belly) is a wee bit fatty, but the crackling roasted pork was pretty good.While the dim sum and other items on the menu were tasty too, the key draw here should be the duck!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,The jury is out,30,09-25-16,"@TheKuoKnowsI am in two minds about London Fat Duck. On the one hand the Roast Duck was quite superb. But on the other hand, the price seems a little steep at 48 bucks for a whole bird.That said, the duck was exquisite. A tasty skin enveloped a meaty duck with barely a trace of fat. It was also very well presented. So, only fond memories and a sprig of parsley remained at the end of the meal.The Crispy Roast Belly Pork was also outstanding. How do they get the Siu Yuk crackling so perfect? The let-down, though, was the portion size. It was quite meagre.Kai Lan was not an optional seasonal vegetable. Only Choy Sum was on offer. I don't believe Kai Lan is rationed in Singapore. So a choice of seasonal vegetables would not go amiss.There are lots to like about London Fat Duck. But if it is going to charge ""Scotts Square"" prices, then it has to at least try to serve Albert Square portions. That is, if you are true to your London name."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner,10,09-23-16,This place i strongly do not recommend as there are many houseflies flying around and disturb me and my friends while we have dinner. Heard is newly open in vivo city at basement 2. Wanted to try out but it was really dissappointing. The food is not tasty at all and to have so many houseflies flying around the table while having meal is horrible. All the service staffs are not attentive at all. Horrible horrible please do not waste your money.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Thinly sliced moon cake as ""pickles"" in my tab",20,09-11-16,"This being the moon cake festival in singapore, when a small dish of 4 thinly sliced moon cakes were served we thought it was for tasting so we could buy them home when our meal ends. At checkout we were told these were ""pickles"" and chargeable at $3. I requested for the bill to be retabulated since we were not told the cost beforehand. A rather non-transparent bit of marketing here, i wld say. Although they acceded to my request, this left a tinge of a bad taste to an otherwise juicy and fatty duck rice I had. Check your ""pickles"" when you come here. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Smooth Duck Specialty,40,09-06-16,"Specialized in roasted duck. The rice is normal while the noodle is specially thin that can either flow through or stuck in the gaps between the teeth. The duck is smooth and soft and the skin roasted to perfect crispy texture.The signature side dishes include London duck buns with pepper or original flavour, crispy shrimp dumplings and steamed cheong fun. My personal pick is the pepper London duck bun coated with black pepper adding spicy flavour to the outer bun which upon ""bitten"" ""secreted"" juicy sauce enclosing small bits of duck meat."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OK,30,09-04-16,"Took our dad for Father's Day. Best dish was the signature crispy snow buns with duck. Ordered seconds.
Otherwise the dim sum are pretty standard."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck ... disappointing,30,08-31-16,"We had heard so much about London Fat Duck and decided to check it out for ourselves. We ordered the Pork Congee with Century Egg, and Roast Duck Noodles. Both were pretty good. Unfortunately the rest of the dim sum items ordered did not hit the mark at all.The Duck Snow Buns were way too sweet; and so was the Steamed Chee Cheong Fun. The Shrimp in Crispy Beancurd Skin Fritters were super greasy and almost dripping in oil. The Crispy Black Pepper Duck Spring Rolls were indeed crispy but the filling was again too sweet and I found the black pepper to be overpowering. The panfried carrot cake was just average.My advice to the restaurant: stick to serving the roast meats and forget the dim sum."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice duck n roasted meat,40,08-20-16,"We went to the new outlet at Vivo City. The duck has very nice and crispy skin, meat was juicy and the sauces nice. The roasted meat - especially 'char Siew' is nice.Other dim sum not bad. Taste like most HK cruisine prepared by HK chefs. Place was crowded. Book early or queue early. Pro.icing reasonable. Sitting capacity limited."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat duck was skinny.....,30,08-18-16,"Maybe they ran out of fat ducks....but ours was not especially juicy and fat like those in London. ...
Maybe they have lost their magic......
Duck also was that tasty....no different from what we can get from the food courts...."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,More Misses Than Hits,20,08-12-16,The signature roasted duck was fragrant and quite juicy. It was not bad but did not impress at all. Both the black pepper bun and crispy snow bun was good. The rest of the dishes was quite a disaster. 2 of items was almost uneatable: the jellyfish was too sour and the the char-siew was over burned. Service was not able to cope with the pack restaurant that afternoon. Overall it was a very disappointing lunch.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch ,20,08-06-16,Located in Scott's square. Food is so so only. The har kau skin is thick. I ordered their signature roast duck with roast pork as in photo. I was given the breast meat which consist mainly bones. Maybe just my unlucky day.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Love the Fat Ducks!,40,08-05-16,"Service was just passable. But soon forgotten with the really lovely duck and roast meats.
Recommend to go after 3pm to avoid the crowd and have faster service.
Do also order their carrot cakes!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice duck & dim sum,40,08-04-16,"Went there for lunch with my in-laws and family. Ordered the duck dish, char siew, roasted, pandan snow custard bun and signature black pepper London Duck bun. The char siew was made from more fatty meat and tasted a little spongy. The duck, pandan snow bun and roasted pork were nice. However we found the black pepper London duck bun was too spicy and peppery. Perhaps should have tried the London Duck Snow bun."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good only if you order whole duck,40,08-03-16,"Make sure to 'order only' the whole duck so you can be sure of the parts given.I came here once for a single portion meal accompanied with noodle, and I was given a few pathetic pieces of boney-parts with hardly any meat. I was so disappointed. It gives me the impression that they're serving left-over parts taken from 'whole' duck orders from others "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great lunch ,40,07-12-16,Overall great char Siew and roasted pork belly and roast duck which is more meaty and have more favours. Truly enjoy my lunch here. Prices are rather friendly. Perhaps was there just before noon and place does gets pack up rather fast.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Average place. Decent food, not mindblowing but service was horrible.",30,07-07-16,"Being a fan of roast duck, I just had to try this new place out. There was a queue even though I decided to have an early dinner at around 5.30pm. Waited for around 30 minutes or so before we were shown to our table.We ordered the combination platter for 3 people, which was made up of some roast duck, roasted pork belly and char siew. We also ordered a plate of dumpling noodles and carrot cake.The roasted combination platter, although they said was for 3, was miserably small. The duck we were given was made up of mostly ribs. We should have tried ordering half a duck or something, which would give us a more well rounded taste of the bird. There was nothing spectacular about the duck I must say. The char siew on the other hand was pretty good! It had a nice smokiness about it with the flavors lingering in the mouth. Quite well done for local standards. The roasted pork belly was the best of the 3 meats. The meat was not too salty and the skin was beautifully crispy. It went perfectly well with the horseradish sauce. If I had to deduct points, I would deduct it for being too small a portion.The carrot cake was quite well done, it had nice chunks of white raddish embedded in it and the overall flavor was just nice. It wasn't overly greasy and went very well with the chilli sauce.The dumpling noodles were pretty average, nice fat dumplings but the portions were incredibly small. Thankfully that order was meant for a 4 year old who finished it quite easily. The service however, just like in most local places, leaves much to be desired. When we were nearly done with our meal, and I do mean nearly done, the waiters were overly enthusiastic about cleaning the table and started taking away the empty bowls and plates and some of the cutlery......leaving me to wonder how was I to finish off that last piece of carrot cake on the table. My daughter, who took a ""break"" during dinner to use the toilet, nearly had her bowl of noodles taken away as well and we had to tell the waiter that we weren't done a few times while his hands went all over the table. I can understand the rush but they missed out on us ordering desserts."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overpriced/Overrated,30,06-30-16,"Most pieces of BBQ meat was burnt, duck was soft but the flavour wasn't there, the roasted pork was good with the mustard. Overall service was poor."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Uberly tasty roast duck at a very reasonable price!,50,06-28-16,"One of my cheaper eats in Singapore and amazingly good. The roast duck was tender and juicy, while the skin was crisp, the crispy pork was perfect and the char sui was out of this world."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Gathering with Friends,40,06-16-16,"Had dinner with my friends at London Fat Duck, located at Scotts Square basement tonight. Nearest MRT will be Orchard station.It's the few restaurants that still serves dim sum all day. Nice roast duck, roast pork and smooth porridge. Restaurant has about 40-50 seating, with 2 big tables good for 8 persons each. Polite waiters and waitresses served promptly.Enjoyed. Tasty food at above average prices."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quick lunch & nothing special ... ,30,05-31-16,"Heard so often there's London fat duck. Then, there's also 4 Seasons @ Capitol. At last, I am trying this London fat duck.Average is an understatement I must admit. The next rating is very good which honestly, it would be an overkill. Let's put it, it's GOOD.For the price I paid for today @ $26. It's overpriced for just a portion, with plain noodles n hot tea.I had an amazing portion in London @ four Seasons, same offering at a much lower price than Singapore. Furthermore, it was better.Let's put it this way. At $26. I won't be back for awhile.Duck 7/10Ambience : 6/10Service : 7/10"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, delivered Fast!",50,05-31-16,"Had lunch with 4 other colleagues, good and value for money tim sum. Great Roast Duck, its really fat.. juicy and flavourful. The Hong Kong style noodles were good too. Mixed review of the Roast Char Siew as well as the signature Pandan liu sha Bao.. I love them both but not my colleagues.The crab porridge was good :)Total damage $131 for 5 persons, I think its really affordable, bearing in mind the amount of food we ate.We were seated at a corner, and found it difficult to capture the attention of the service staff. But when served, they were friendly and assisted accordingly. Food service was really fast, and fresh! Only one gripe, throw the jumpy CD that you are using, its jumps really badly and is an ear-sore! Will definitely be back!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,One of the Best Roast Duck,40,05-30-16,"London Fat Duck is definitely one of the best Roast Duck restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity.
They have nice menu and most of the food are high standard"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-priced duck and pathetically small portion,20,05-05-16,"We were at the Waterway Point outlet last evening for dinner. Needed to wait 20 to 30 minutes for a table on a weekday night. We were attracted by the long queue to try the food there. The portions were pathetically small. Unreasonably over priced for everything, especially for the plate of duck noodles with only four thin slices of duck meat @$8.80 and tasted bland. When you asked for chilli, the waitress would forget totally even though you reminded her twice. That would be our first and last visit to London Fat Duck."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Overpriced Soggy Roast Duck and Roast Pork, Reheated Char Siew ",10,05-04-16,"Was at the Waterway Point outlet this evening for dinner. Waited for more than half an hour for a table at 7:30pm on a weekday night. Portions were small. Ridiculously over priced. Plain steamed rice was $2 per small bowl. 15 thin slices of char siew costs $12.80. First time, last time and one time too many!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It was just average,30,05-02-16,"No need to queue when I was at the Waterway Point outlet for a weekday late lunch.Tried the mixed roast platter (signature roast duck, crackling pork belly & bbq pork), black pepper bun and wanton noodle.I find the black pepper taste was too strong for the bun. The roast duck was nice, but nothing fantastic. The surprised was the pork belly. The skin was indeed crackling, while the meat was tender."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,If you love duck,40,04-29-16,"Great duck place. Their roasted duck is succulent and tender. Don't forget the char siew (BBQ pork with honey sauce). A little charred on the outside, yet soft and tender inside. It is a simple place for Hong Kong style noodles and porridge."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Basic,30,04-28-16,"tried this at waterwaypoint mall (Punggol) ordered the signature duck congee and duck platter. food was basic so as the presentation. tasted clean though which was good.service was average. not friendly, not snobbish either. would be a good place to eat if you're just looking for something to fill the stomach but not really for culinary pleasure."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck @ Waterway Point,10,04-21-16,"Crispy duck but the skin is not crisp but chewy.The filling inside the signature bun is sweet, taste more like chopped up bbq pork than duck! We ordered the original flavour without the pepper. Was served the pepper ones but as it is our first time in the restaurant and they do not have any me use with pictures for you to see while seated, we therefore was not aware that they had served u the pepper version until we took one and cut up to try. We told the waitress and they only replaced with 2 buns instead of the whole plate of 3! It's not our fault if they serve the wrong item but why should we be have only 2 out of 3 replaced! Chinese tea is not even warm let alone hot.The dish servings are very pathetic for the price ."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not to my expectation,30,04-20-16,"Prior to the dinner, I admit I had too high expectation on the food and this seemed to lower my dining experience. The theme of the dinner- London fat duck, as the name implies, the duck is indeed fat. Hence after the 5th or 6th piece of the duck, we got really full and felt sick of eating more. The restaurant also served other dim sum but the taste was so-so only."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Its all about the duck,40,04-16-16,"So there is some dim sum dishes but otherwise it is all about the duck. This is suppose to be the wagyu of duck air flown from Ireland - it is that good with a thick layer of fat between the skin and meat. There is very little else on the menu though, so its all about the duck!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London duck,10,04-10-16,So so only. I can confirm it is not even near the look and taste on London roasted duck. Quite disappointed
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-hyped.,20,04-08-16,"With all the rave about the ""Wagyu of Duck"", I decided to try it out for myself. Let's start with the food. To be honest, the duck tasted pretty average to me. I personally prefer their Char Siew better than the Roasted Duck (and my girlfriends agreed too). Besides that, the rest of the dishes are alright. I won't say it's fantastic or like out-of-this-world. But if you do head down and try, do try their Duck Bun and Egg Tarts. That I recommend. Be warned though. With the expected waiting time (since they just opened and everyone wants a piece of their duck), the place was a little messy and chaotic. The plus point for them for our night there is the lovely wait-staff who was assisting us (just that one nice auntie) and that the food came almost instantaneously.Now, I can say ""I've been there, done that."""
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Heaven!,40,04-07-16,"I am from the U.S. so I may not have many good experiences with real Chinese bar b q. I am in love with this place and am so glad I was able to stop by for a bite of heaven. The roast pork here was awesome. I love how the meat is marbled with fat and then a thin crispy skin, there is no thick layer of fat that I am accustomed to here in the states. Can't wait to come back."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It was ok,30,04-03-16,"It was ok. Some strange flavour combinations. Food was freshly cooked and good quality.
Could find better valued meals elsewhere."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very fat duck indeed!,30,03-25-16,I find the restaurant name cute although I can't quite connect London and fat duck. The food served here is Cantonese cuisine. Roasted duck is very fatty and a little too salty so this experience may be rather scary for health conscious eaters. I prefer the Char Siew meat as it is pretty well done. Food quality is good but not exceptional. I do know of hawker stalls that serve similar or higher quality roasted duck.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great food and service,50,03-24-16,"Managed to try out this place in HK by Gordon Ramsey.
Great food and service. Great view of harbour. Wonderful crowd and atmosphere."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food quality so so only. Duck is too fat. Lousy customer service.,20,03-20-16,"We ordered the duck noodle. The duck tasted so so only. It had way too much fat for our liking. The noodle was bland and had very little sauce on it. I didn't take the veg because the leaf hung out of the plate and touched the table - disrespectful of the food and the customers they serve.Biggest turnoff: The service staff put the dishes meant for the table besides us on our small and cramp table while they made space over there. They neither asked for our permission nor apologised for the inconvenience and discomfort caused. They couldn't be bothered whether it disturbed our dining pleasure. I will NEVER eat there again, ever!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner at Waterway Point,40,03-13-16,"This restaurant is located at the newly opened Waterway Point at 83, Punggol Central #01-23.You could travelled by bus, LRT and taxi to this Mall.It serves various roasted duck dishes, Hong Kong Congee and noodles, Rice, dim sum, seasonal vegetables, desserts and beverages.Their Signature dishes are London Roast Duck, Barbecue Pork with Honey Sauce, Black Pepper London Duck Bun, Steamed Cheong Fun.The filling of this Cheong Fun is a fried spring roll with prawn. Very unique but please consume while it is hot.The Hong Kong Wanton Noodle and their Golden Custard Bun is a must try dishes.Their Buns surprised me in a way that the skin of normal buns are steamed soft; but their outlook are like biscuit form which are dry. But the buns must be consumed while hot.Those who likes duck dishes should give it a try. But the waiting time is not very encouraging. We waited for 40 mins before a table is available."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Can't even surpass duck rice Ina hawker centre,10,03-12-16,"We ordered duck with rice, crackling pork with rice, each dish $7.80. It came with one half stalk of xiaobaicai, and just a splash of sauce. The duck was powdery to taste. It was quite honestly a big disappointment and there are many hawker centres which would easily surpass this restaurant in standard. A dish of oyster veg also cost $$7.80, consisting of eight half stalks of xiaobaicai boiled and splashed with oyster sauce. There was no queue. We told the wait staff that the food was not acceptable. She thought we were talking about the rice itself, and could not believe that we were talking about the duck. Never again "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is fat,30,03-07-16,"Visited the shop twice. The duck is tasty but is fat. Noodle with roasted pork is nice. Overall, foods are good but not the best in town."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck but average dim sum,30,03-07-16,"Xiao Long Bao is juicy and meaty but the dipping sauce is salty with little ginger . Dried wanton noodle is eaten best with chilli sauce , only comment is quite pricy with little noodles served. ""Ting chai"" congee is actually congee with cuttlefish and peanuts . But the peanuts too hard. Duck is juicy and oily , if you don't mind the oil. Meat is tender. Service is good. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over HYPED ,20,03-05-16,"For the branding I would have to say really smart putting the name ""London"" in there. I bet many people would have mistaken this place coming from London, only the duck and it's not even from London it's from Ireland.Anyway enough of the history lesson, here is my verdict and as a fan of roast duck, I have my fare share of top ducks around HKG and London this one rank lowly if I were to compare with any of the restaurants I've tried.Taste wise i would have to agree the fats of the duck is really juicy but the let down came with the tenderness and the sauce let alone presentation (not that Goldmine has any beautiful presentation) but I just can't accept the pungent after taste you get.The Char siew is dry and bored with overly sweeten sauce. Wanton noodle was good with plump shrimps Wanton and al dente noodle but soup was just overly salty to my liking.The redeemer here is the liu sha bao, all I have to say try is their dim sum more than what they are known for.Don't expect much service as wait staff seems clueless at times and I was served the wrong dish. Was at the Punggol outlet at 10.15am. If you want duck.. I suggest you going to other places"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious,40,03-02-16,Food was excellent... Loved the Roasted pork and duck.. moist and tasty! I ordered a Congee with pork liver and it was delicious as well. Loved the food at this restaurant! But the only reason they don't get a full 5/5 rating is because of the not so friendly staff. Even though the food they served kind of made up for it but still... service is probably the most important thing they should be upholding in a restaurant. Nonetheless... great food!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Appalling Service,10,03-01-16,"Food was alright, no wow factor. We were truly disappointed with the service, rude and unreliable. I also ordered take away however they missed out a few items on the list but yet I was charged for the dimsum. And when I returned a couple of days later to claim the missing items, the service staff was not happy. Did not even apologise!Extremely poor service!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not as good as the first time,30,02-27-16,The duck was a disappointment this time. It tasted a bitter and was rather fat. The dim sums were good but nothing to shout about. However the custard buns were worth eating. They were uniquely baked with pandan on the outside
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very tasty dishes,40,02-23-16,"My family and I visited the newly opened outlet at Punggol Waterway Point for dinner. We ordered the duck buns (HK ""Po lo"" style), steamed shrimp dumpling (har gao), siew mai, assorted 3 BBQ meats platter, shrimp/pork dumpling soup with noodles, vegetables with oyster sauce and signature rice rolls. The dim sum items were fresh and tasty and very similar to the good Guangzhou dim sum restaurants that I went to, but not as good as the HK ones. The rice rolls we ordered were actually deep fried spring rolls covered with a thin layer of smooth rice flour skin. Quite novel for me but not as tasty. The noodles were comparable with Canton Paradise and some HK restaurants. Shrimp/pork dumplings were very flavourful due to the fresh ingredients and had a good texture. But the best was the roast meat platter. The pork belly (sio bak) and roast duck could easily match those offered at fine dining Cantonese restaurants and the tender BBQ pork (char siew) had a rich and luxurious sauce. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average,30,02-03-16,"We were disappointed with the poor service, very small meal sizes and expensive for what you got. The food was ok, plenty of other better places in Singapore to go. Wouldn't go back."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food standard till good service better,40,02-01-16,"Had breakfast on 30/1/16 duck noodle, porridge some tim sum. The duck bun still good and so is the custard bun serve pipping hot yum yum, love it. For 4 pax we spend $67.00 also have some duck wing, carrot cake , chicken feet, dough fritter.Good place for tim sum."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Singapore Oily Bird,20,01-28-16,"So what if they source their ducks from a renowned farm in London? Without the know-how and skills, even if they use some sort of celestial phoenix, it will still taste mortally cheap.However, London Fat Duck achieved in proving to be a model example of Marketing 101.So A for marketing, a big fat and oily F for everything else."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated!,30,01-20-16,"Before today I had only ordered takeaway char siew which was nice and tender but expensive @ $15.90 for 11 small slices. Not sure that it was worth it. I had also ordered the black pepper duck buns (all good - moist, tender duck, soft bun - except maybe a bit too much of the black pepper).Today I had a late lunch in the restaurant. By the way, they have taken additional space (see photo). Had duck noodles and warm barley. Duck was tender, skin not crispy at all. I had to remove the fat but alas the skin came off too. Barley was not even warm. Waiters and Waitresses in Singapore food outlets have a problem understanding 'hot', 'warm' & 'luke warm'.So my conclusion is that it is not 'die, die must eat'."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overcharging poor service,20,01-17-16,"Used to like this place a lot for the food - would have given 5 stars thenNow, Duck and noodles the only things worth making the trip forService is poor, even worse than HK fast food restaurants - part time staff are better than the full timersToo many things wrong with the service to listTip - dont go for meals In between times just have a plate of duck and noodlesTip 2 - costs less per head if u bring small children as their tables are strictly per head and not by the amount of food you order (they will clear unfinished plates to make room for all the dishes you order if you order 'too many' dishesTip 3 - check the bill, overcharging happened more than onceOtherwise you'd do better at a more upscale dim sum restaurant w/out overcrowding, condescending attitudes and staff chasing you out so that they can pack in the next bunch of familiesOr if you're just into noodles, for similar quality noodles (sadly, no irish ducks) go to Maks at CentrepointAverage bill for 2 - US$70 without beverages"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a fat duck with HK attitude,30,01-09-16,"It's an aircon eatery, your typical modern HK roasted meat shop in a mall. The service is something you need to manage your own expectations, do not expect well trained staff. You won't get patient introduction of each dish, or recommendations, you are quite expected to write down what you want on the menu paper and have little chit chat. That said, the duck is good, noodles decent, soup is the usual HK too salty type, wanton noodles, dim sum, etc are average. I would come back again, but not often. The food is decent for the price you pay. But that said, you can get very similar standard at any neighborhood coffee shop roasted meat delights stalls. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very fatty Duck,30,01-04-16,"Ordered normal very fatty Duck, tasty and nice Pork Belly, over burn at the side of Char Siew tasted bitter and satringent rice and noodle.
Told the waitess, she scine unhappy to take my comment."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Okay Duck and DIm Sum,30,01-03-16,"We had our 2015 Countdown in Singapore. My Sister insist that we visit this place as she had a good experiences here and compared it with the duck we had in London.Was told that this place is usually pack and queue up to two hours!! We went early New Year (1 Jan 2016) morning (10:00am), since everyone still suffering from hangover during countdown (haahaahaa)....We ordered duck, pork belly, char Siew, and dim sums.The duck is good but not great. Quite bony. Crispy Pork Belly and Char-Siew are better.Dim Sum are not bad too. The Crispy Char-Siew Pao is a must tryThe plain noodle is quite tough, not good.When we finished around 11:15am, the queue already formed. Overall, its okay food. Give it at try.The place is in Basement 1 (B1) Scott Square Orchard Road) The building next to Tang Plaza (which is opposite ION)"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,2nd try for egg tarts,30,01-01-16,"Went around 6pm. Luckily the crowd is not big. Manage to get a table for 2. Try the duck noodle, duck peppers poa, chicken legs n red beans jelly. The noodle is salty n nothing special. Ask for egg tarts but is out of stock. They don't have time to make the base. Will try another time..."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck was not the star!,30,11-28-15,"Visited the London Fat Duck today. We had the Roast Duck, crispy Pork Belly, Char Siew Bao crispy buns and Cheong Fun. With Chinese tea and Barley the total bill was just over $50. The star dish was the pork belly. The duck was so-so with a lot of bone and not too much meat. I would not go back for the duck but the other dishes were good. Service was quick and efficient. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,food standard till good,40,11-24-15,"brought an oversea guest there 9th nov 2015. order the famous duck, tim sum
the food standard is still good. tim sum range not very large but quality is good enough to fill the stomach."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,So so duck....,30,11-21-15,Previously when it opened the queues were long and the duck was juicy and delicious....Went back recently and we were able to get a table easily (has the interest died?)....and the duck was not as good as before. ...And they only have one type.of vegetable.....no choice....
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Small little eatery in the city center with good value and quality food,40,11-15-15,"This restaurant used duck from Ireland, which has a nice layer of fat.After roasting, it tasted different from the local varieties.Other then the signature roast duck, which is good., the signature black pepper London duck bun is unique too.The bun had a thick layer of black pepper on it outer surface of the bun filled with duck meat. The combination gives a very interesting taste with sweet and peppery at the same time.The rest of the noodle and Tim Sum dishes are of good quality too.This is one of the few places in Singapore that serves Tim Sum after 3pm.I would return again to try the rest of the dishes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,yummy fat duck,40,11-14-15,"my 2nd returning visit to the restaurant.
their ducks are really nice.. the roasted pork is also another must try item to order. porridge was alright but not the noodles. service rendered would need some form of improvement. their buns are good too!snowy bun especially"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,On the fence,30,11-13-15,"Had lunch with friends about a month ago and we all found the duck and char siew pretty yummy. I like my pork slightly fatty and the char siew at London Fat Duck had just the right balance, in my opinion. It was also nicely charred on the outside. The duck meat was moist and tender. And not gamey. Service was prompt. I returned once to do a takeaway. Something I wouldn't do again. The taste just wasn't the same and everyone at home felt it was no better than the roast duck at our nearby food centre. This proves once again that many foods are best eaten on the spot. I'd be happy to go back to London Fat Duck for that plate of duck noodles or char siew rice if there isn't any queue."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Chinese BBQ and Dim Sum Together!,50,11-02-15,"Stopped in for a a take-away order. They were quick to take my order and the food was prepared in a reasonable time.I ordered BBQ pork with the Honey Sauce, Shrimp Dumplings, Radish Cakes and Crispy Shrimp Dumplings.Each dish was delicious. You do not need this many dishes for a meal as this was way more food than I needed. It was so good that I did end up eating too much though."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Really Tasty Duck..,40,10-28-15,"Be prepared to wait for your queue if you come during dinner timings.
Great tasting duck, very fatty. Typical Chinese restaurant type of setting, with oily floors."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just brilliant,40,10-27-15,"I knew that I loved this place after my first experience and I knew that I would be returning. Four visits and I still want more. That is four visits in three weeks!. If you like efficient staff, authentic food and a taste paradise then come here. You would usually order with pen and check boxes but sometimes they bring out the iPads which is fun. My few recommendations: get the brisket noodle. It is incredible. Any of the dim sum is also wonderful. My favourite is the steamed prawns. The Hong Kong won tons are very good too. My one disappointment was the signsture fat duck dumpling. Mostly rice and little duck. Of course I have to mention the duck. Excellent but it comes with the bones. So note that. Before I go home, I will be back. Come off peak, you will be waiting at peak hours for a minimum of an hour. 4pm for lunch and 8 pm for dinner are my suggestions."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Great Duck, Lousy Service ",20,10-19-15,"This review is not about the food as I have reviewed this before. Have the much applauded roast duck as well as roast meats but you certainly don't come here for the exemplary service.Firstly I have to say my expectations are minimal as this is not a fine dining restaurant, just your basic Chinese eatery. Having established this, I would have to express shock at being driven out after 40 minutes. This is something that has never happened to me. Ever.I had lunch with friends & while there was never any intention to linger, even my friends were shocked at the level of rudeness when we were asked to leave after the last dish was cleared. There was no attempt to ask if we cared for dessert. Last time I ate here, service was brusque & I did not expect much. In future if I craved the duck, it would be better to get take out rather than sit through this sort of treatment. It isn't worth it & we weren't even demanding customers. All we asked was to be able to leave when we were ready. By the way it was the tail end of lunch & there certainly wasn't a queue."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious,40,10-18-15,"Had no idea that this restaurant might be popular but it happened to be near where we were staying so decided to try it out and enjoyed the food. Figure we should ordered the specials so stuck with the pork and the duck and the buns and they were all delicious. There was a bit of a queue at about 7pm but we were seated within about 15 minutes, service was quick and we enjoyed the buzzy atmosphere"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Best Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce,40,10-11-15,Excellent taste of Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce. One of best in Singapore in addition to the Signature London Roast Duck. Queue is more than 30 mins but it is worth it. Black pepper London Duck Bun is another great choice. The duck and pork are so juicy. Better come earlier to avoid long queue.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just alright...,30,10-02-15,"Waited for more than 30mins on a Friday dinner. Worth the wait? I don't think so. Can get half the price for the duck noodle at hawker, with similar or better taste. For those who like the duck snow bun, can give it a try. Sweet and crispy. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not impressed,10,09-27-15,"If I am not mistaken, this restaurant is inspired by the four seasons and gold mine in bayswater, London. We had the roast duck, char siew, egg tart, duck snow bun and weren't impressed with either of the items. The duck fat wasn't rendered at all - the roast roast duck had thick slab of fat between the skin and meat. I didn't know they meant the name London fat duck that literally. In my opinion, the ideal roast duck should have succulent meat texture but with minimal visual fat between the skin and meat. The meat was kind of dry in this case. Char siew was okay, loads of honey. Egg tart had more flour taste than egg. The duck snow bun needs improvement because the snow bun is sweet with the powdered sugar on top, the duck sauce was even sweeter. Just a quarter of this snow bun sends you in line for diabetes. I guess we just expected so much more because we liked the four season's version of roast duck and when we visited the restaurant, we had the impression that it would be similar."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Out of this world ,50,09-24-15,"If you like the roast duck to be crispy and a bit fat, then you will enjoy this. If you like your duck lean, then this is not for you. We had it for lunch together with wanton noodles which was very good too with the noodles al Dente. Had the roast pork and the famous snow bun. Only problem is they do not allow reservation so you have to go early and queue. Also not many big tables "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Super Good Crispy Bun with black pepper duck,40,09-22-15,"For enthusiats inChinese Dimsum this restaurant is a must when visiting Singapore. The spiciness and crispy texture of the bun really had me begging for more. I tried Siew Long Pao too and it turned out to be quite good for me. Served hot and not so overpriced making dim sum here a lovely experience in my trip this time. I went during late afternoon hours which made me getting no long queuing experience, so I would recommend the time for your visit to avoid the crowd."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Highlight of our trip,50,09-18-15,Now this place is amazing. The food was the best we had in Singapore. Yes you have to wait (we waited an hour) but there is a good reason for that and it's worth every second. We ordered while we waited so when we were called to a table the food was fast and ohhh so yummy. We tried a bit of everything and there was not one thing to complain about. If you are in Singapore make sure you take the time to check this little hidden gem out!Thank you London Fat Duck - you are a credit to Singapore
Chinese,London Fat Duck,duck and black pepper char siew bun,40,09-17-15,"waited 15 minutes at around 7pm on a weekday for my seat. the duck meat is tender and the skin crispy, the pepper charsiew bun was pipping hot. i ordered one whole duck and was only given 2 teaspoon full of plum sauce, i asked for extra plum sauce and was given another 2 teaspoon's full :( will go back again for the food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tender duck!,40,09-13-15,"The waiter couldn't find our reservation and the place was full. They sat 6 of us at a table for 4, and it was a tight squeeze. They promised us the next available table but it never happened.We ordered a number of dishes and a few stood out, among which was the roast duck which was very tender and delicious. The salted egg custard buns were nice, but the bun was very thin and it broke, leaking its contents all over my hand.The roast pork was crispy and lean, but the pieces were unevenly cut, and the portion seemed very small for the price."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,YUM!,40,09-02-15,"We ate both the duck and the char siew...both were amazing! Also had the black pepper buns, which are a must. Service is prompt, friendly, and courteous. We brought our own wine, corkage fee a bit steep but we wanted something great to drink with such great food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the Duck!,30,08-31-15,"Ok, the name is attractive. Expect to queue since the restaurant doesn't take reservations. The duck is fatty, dripping with oil, succulent, sinful i.e. tasty. The other must-try dish is the pepper-flavoured duck meat bun which is freshly baked. Apart from these, I had tried the char siew and the roast meat, both of which seemed a tad ordinary. But the duck is worth coming back for. Service is quite prompt and courteous. A crowd-puller in the otherwise quiet basement of Scotts Square. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is great,30,08-28-15,"Decided to bring my in-laws to this new duck outlet for dinner after knowing that the brand now has a branch here in singapore as i am a big fan of roasted duck.First impression was that the restaurant felt more like a food court. We were directed to the VIP room. The VIP room consists of 2 large tables and sadly, the other group in our room was very noisy and rowdy as its a group consisted of all men, most like colleagues. Anyway, the background music was also very loud and thus, very irritating. Called the server to ask them to turn down the volume but told me cannot be done. Asked her to get her manager and after her manager came in, he decided to lower the volume.Service is only so-so and atmosphere as well. But the duck is good in my opinion. But i expect a complete dining experience as the food here is not really cheap as well. Wanted to change the size of the dishes we ordered after they served them and we realised its too little for all of us. The server told us that we cannot do it. I was so puzzled why not as simply they could bring back the medium plate of duck and add more to it. Instead she asked me to order another medium plate which made the whole meal more expensive.If its not for the service and atmosphere, i would have given it a 4 out of 5!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Long wait for slightly above average food,30,08-23-15,"Arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night and saw a small crowd already waiting. Was told the wait will be about 20 mins which was acceptable but instead we waited for almost 45 mins before given a table for 7 of us.As mentioned the place is more a cafeteria style whereby you select from the order chit the food you wanted. Looking at the prices, would same it is reasonable considering the location and service is much better than expected.The side dishes such as the porridge is good as well as the duck bun.However the duck as mentioned is very fatty to suit me though the skin is rightly roasted. They should work on improving the choices of vegetables though as there is only 1 item. Overall the price is reasonable but not worth the wait."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fatty duck,40,08-17-15,High in demand and patience required for a long wait to obtain a table. Roast pork & duck sell out very fast so order them when you get your queue number. Selection of vegetable dishes was poor.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good food & Good service,40,08-13-15,I went to this restaurant with high hopes that the duck would resemble those I've eaten in London and it did not fail me. The duck was obviously not from our part of the world as the layer of fats was exceptionally thicker than normal. The price for a portion for 1-2 persons at $12.80 was reasonable especially if you are eating other dishes. The Shrimp dumpling soup was normalThe crispy London duck snow bun was commendable tho a tad sweet. Egg tarts were actually very good. Very Flaky pastry with excellent smooth egg filling.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Succulent duck,40,08-04-15,"Went there on a weekday for lunch. There was a long Q but well controlled. Suppose it is a novelty for Singaporeans. The wait was worth it . The duck is tasty, succulent and the noodles have a nice crunch. We also had the ""char siew"" which is more local than ""London"" . It tasted sweet and goes well with rice"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A shame to call it London . .,30,08-02-15,"I have lived many year in London,"" though many years ago "". . and love the duck served in the Chines restaurants there. The duck here does not live up to any that I have had in London, in any restaurants there.I like the buns with a sweet black peber crust though . and i am glad I went for these.I will only go if I was close by . . again"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat Duck!!!,30,07-30-15,"I am not a fans of Duck meat but London Fat Duck had left a deep impression in my mouth. For health conscious people might not like the fatness of the meat. I Iove the fatness of the meat, soft to chew and the roasted Skin is crisp, goes very well with the plum sauce. Tried their signature Chee Cheong Fun, it's actually the fried prawn spring roll wrap with Chee Cheong Fun, interesting combine and its delicious. Black Pepper duck Snow Bun taste like McDonald's Prosperity burger. Overall feel the food is good but might not want to queue too long for a table. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A nice weekend brunchy kinda place,40,07-30-15,This place did not disappoint me. Had the duck and noodles and plenty of dim sum and polished off everything. Price is very reasonable and portions are reasonable. Good quality dim sum and the duck was very tasty. A great place for anyone who loves duck and dim sum in general. Would definitely come back for more!! 
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Pretty good,40,07-22-15,"Was recommended by my uncle to try this place and was pleasantly surprised. The black pepper duck bun was very good and the cha siu was original tasting. Slight complaint would be the duck...very fatty and if that's what you like, then there should be no problem. Overall a simple and good lunch experience and would definitely recommend to others."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, Inattentive Service, Expensive",40,07-21-15,"Had lunch recently & found the food to be good. Nice roast duck with crispy skin and a flavoursome sauce. Decent roast pork with crispy crackling and excellent char siu that was dark and glazed with charred bits that so many look for. Hong Kong style dishes that judging from the dishes we had would get my thumbs up. Nice shrimp dumpling soup & congee. A selection of dim sum available - recommend the black pepper buns which are a nice variation on the familiar ""po lor bau"".The restaurant fills up fast and doesn't take reservations. Go early to snag a table without too much of a wait. However they are forgetful and we were overlooked despite being given a queue number. No apologies but they quickly got us a table when reminded. Servers tend to be inattentive and it's hard to catch their attention; they all seemed too busy. Perhaps the best suggestion is to order take out & save all the hassle. Other people did. Would definitely come back for the food.Essentially for small portions, the bill came to S$100 including an order of custard tarts for dessert."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Pleasant place for lunch and dinner,40,07-14-15,"Good Hong Kong style dinning, have taken London roast duck noodle, signature black pepper bun and crispy London duck snow bun and love it."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Yummy char siew noodles,40,07-11-15,"I was glad that I asked for take out with such a long wait going for those looking to eat at the restaurant. It was a small area and hence the long queue. I ordered the char siew noodles and duck noodles. Both are dry version . The take away was a genius, the sauces and chili were all provided in separate containers. by the time I got home, the noodles were still springy ,not soggy."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over Hype Average Food,30,07-05-15,"LFD is not related to the Four Seasons Restaurant in London and also has nothing to do with the Fat Duck in UK. Instead the ducks were claimed to be Irish. It is only a typical Hong Kong style Cantonese restaurant.Although the shop names emphasised on duck, you can also find many others Hong Kong style dim sum, wanton noodle and etc. The roast ducks is nice but not fantastically nice. The ducks served was fat and juicy. On the other hand the Honey sauced Char Siew is surprisingly good. Fat but not greasy. We didn't get to try the roast pork. The other dim sum and dumpling that we had ordered are actually quite authentically Hong Kong that you can find it in any Hong Kong street stalls.The time we visited the restaurant was on a Saturday evening and long queue had already formed and we have to wait for 50 mins to get our table. By the time our turn was up at 8pm, many items on the menu had been sold out.The pricing of the food is at mid range and mostly appropriately priced except the white rice that cost us SGD2.50 per bowl which is outrageous.Verdict is the food is good, price is reasonable and location is good so we don't mind coming back again if the waiting time can be shorter."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nothing much special,10,07-01-15,"I was waiting for someone to assist me to be seated when a guy approached me and lead me to the table.. however, i was directed to one of the table that was dirty and seems that the previous customer had just left. . I dont mind seating but the impression could have been better if they seated me to a clean and already set up table (which they have few coz they werent that busy much when i came)..anyway i order congee with century egg.. shrimp spring roll and an ice tea.. congee came befire the drinks and it would be better if they add a little bit of veggies or perhps like spring onion inside to shrimp springroll coz it tastes to plain.. neverthe less the congee tastes ok.. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,For duck lovers only,40,07-01-15,"The roast ducks are indeed fat like its namesake and that's exactly what it has promised to offer and that's what I am here for. It's probably one of the few restaurants in Singapore which is serving free range ducks from Ireland. It's definitely above average - duck is juicy, flavorful and fat. I also tried the black pepper duck bun, which is quite delicious. I went at 5ish on a Saturday and was seated in 15-20mins. Will revisit if i am in the neighbourhood and if I dont have to wait for too long. And at $48 per duck, it's quite reasonably priced."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat Duck,30,06-22-15,"Came here for lunch . Had dim sum and the signiture fat duck. Duck was good, dim sum was average. Service is ok."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the duck and buns. Forget the rest.,30,06-21-15,Singapore hawker food is hard to beat. Fat duck buns are tasty although a bit too sweet for me. The duck has enough taste and texture to warrant another visit if you are around the area and need a quick duck fix. The char siew deserves be a mention but is priced more than its weight in gold. Long live the hawker centers!! 
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Don't be a sheep to give in to media manipulations. Riding on a bad pun of another restaurant.,10,06-21-15,"Well, as stated above. my fellow Singaporeans, open your eyes and stop being media manipulated.The food is bad, seriously bad. And with prices like that, i scoff in disgust. Apparently not the 45min-1hr wait time crowd.when you are charging $12-15++ per portion of roasted meat, it better be freaking good, ESPECIALLY if that said portion is only enough for 1 person.Duck - tasteless, soggy skin, crappy 'sauce' ( 70% oil in sauce )Roast Pork - ridiculous portion (i literally laughed), Damn dry. Saw them microwaving some food items, perhaps it's pork?Char siew- passable, too sweet and cloying. Perfect if it's candied pork not char siew.Duck buns (Both black and white) - While the bun itself was good, the filling was Crap. too much Starch in the generic store-bought sauce with duck skin, barely (virtually none) any duck meat.Beef noodle soup - forgettable, with that much MSG, water also taste good.close to $100 for 3 pax, first and last time i get sheared like a sheep. Maybe the reason they omitted pricing on their website's menu is out of shame?Avoid this money focused mill. Even the roast pork stall inside serangoon nex NTUC was far superior (Not that they were any good to begin with) Felt like a tourist being sheared while leaving.Alternatives to good roasted duck is Dian xiao er, or any other place that doesn't take you for a fool."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OVER-RATED: Soon to be Dead-Duck!,30,06-20-15,"Mediocre.There is NOTHING to rave about this restaurant.Their roast duck is slightly above average standards but way to fatty and oily in my personal opinion. Also, though the meat was pretty tender, it didn't have much taste to it - like the marinate hadn't settled into the meat.The rest of the dim sum and food were extremely average, nothing you cannot find in Singapore.This is a try once sort of restaurant that does not have any offerings that would attract you back the second time."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London fat duck review,10,06-19-15,"Although I am a lover of fatty food but thought the duck is too fat for my liking. The duck bun is good though. What surprised me is the bad service and attitude. We ordered quite a lot of food and when we are about 80 % done, the manager came and ask if we want any dessert, we answered no and he showed an unhappy face and said ""if you don't mind hurry up, there was a long queue"". We are only there for 1/2 an hour (including waiting 10 minutes for the food) and we are fast eater. The manager also ordered the waiters to collect the plates while we were eating, at first I thought they wanted to change plates, but no, the replacement never came until I asked. Anyway I wont go there again, duck nothing to shout about and I think I prefer dian xiao er."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,london fat duck the duck is fat but Tim sum dishes is good.,30,06-16-15,"when to try the London fat duck after the review. the 1st time we are lucky when in on a Saturday morning after 10 am not crowded no queue.you have to queue because the place is small sitting limited not that is so good that you queue.order their famous/popular dishes the duck taste good though is fat, the char siew is nice but expensive ($14.80 for about 10-12 small slice)had the wanton noodle not bad like hong kong noodle. price $6.80 per bowl.had some take away the snow bun, duck and char siew and duck dumpling. the duck dumpling is very ordinary nothing to shout about is like normal hong kong dumpling.with bean.($12.90)a week later went with some friend to try the food. This time I order the tim sum. the spring roll, chee cheong fun with do fritter & prawn, pan fried carrot cake, siew mai, they are good. Also order the fat duck and snow bun and char siew . but this time round the fat duck is really fat and oily don't think will order again.the service and knowledge from the staff of the little restaurant is poor in serving their customer.not well train if you don't mind the attitude and their reply concentrate on the food is not bad but is differently not worth to queue for long hours.order custard bun they said no stock. how to be no stock when your restaurant just open for business either the chef don't make the bun or..... don't expect any service just make do and try the food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Signature buns and great char siu,40,06-14-15,"Crowded with long queues so be prepared to wait! The most memorable dish was the signature buns - black pepper duck and crispy London duck. They are baked with a crisp outer crust, soft bread and juicy tasty filling. The barbecue pork with honey (char siu) was delectable. The Signature London roast duck was quite good though we would have preferred it deboned. Give the congee and tim sum items a miss. Have definitely tasted better. There is only one dessert, mango purée with sago and this was refreshing if somewhat average. The prices are very reasonable and service is energetic and fast. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Without the fat duck, this place would be a dead duck!",40,06-13-15,"The only reason(s) to come here are the unique ducks (although the roast pork and the black pepper duck puffs are pretty good). The roast ducks are super yummy - fragrant, moist, tasting almost like geese. In my opinion the best roast ducks in Singapore. Otherwise, other items on the very short menu are less good than at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure (the congees and soups are noticeably bland), and there is no point in coming to the low-traffic Scotts Square mall just for this. Service management is one of the worst in the country - there is always a queue (sometimes extending to one hour!), yet tables are left empty (including some already cleaned) for up to 10 minutes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lack variety but excellent for the signature duck dish,40,06-04-15,"Went for the famous Signature duck. Fatty and juicy and reminds me of the roast goose in HK. Would be even better with the plum sauce but the chili paste is a good replacement. However I find the signature black pepper duck bun to be more special with the kick of black pepper spice. Make excellent alternative to Tim ho wan style bun. The wonton noodle is not bad at all, so is the char siu (glaze pork) and the roast pork belly. All in all makes a wonderful lunch. However as they are new, the operations need to be more finetune. Wrong sequence of orders, long queue at the register counter etc, but I am sure they will get this right soon."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,just a matter of personal taste,30,05-29-15,"a lot of people talk about this restaurant thought the food was OK not bad but also not inline with the prices and the expectations
will go back prefer the duck at MJ1N, just a matter of personal taste"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,attached bakery,40,12-22-17,"so crystal jade also has a bakery arm attached to the restaurant, called ""Crystal Jade My Bread"", not very original but the breads are quite decent."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum Dinner,30,12-19-17,"We ordered Scallop Congee, shark fin soup, char siew bun, prawn dumpling, deep fried prawn in the tofu skin and two desserts. The congee was not good, shark fin..so so. We waited for about 35mins before we are being served. Prices are a bit overpriced and the quality of food has gone down. Maybe we will try out another branch."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very nice soup noodle and fried rice,40,09-02-17,"We're having a brunch at this Crystal Jade in Holland Village after our brisk walk morning exercises. This Crystal Jade is open from morning to serve breakfast dishes, such as hong kong styles congee and dim sum. We really like their shrimp fried rice, wantan shrimp soup noodle and a few other dim sum dishes. Ambience is pretty basic / average, with outdoor seatings. Prices are quite high though, I think little bit overpriced. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Quality of food has gone down,20,05-30-17,"We (3 adults & 1 child) used to frequent this place in the past, but on our last visit, found that the quality of the food has gone down, presumably due to it being packed out at dinner time. Victim of its own success perhaps?Food:The dim sum quality is fine, but the fried rice is now of below average quality (fewer pricey ingredients such as prawns, just full of eggs, over-salted). The fried noodles with mushrooms were also of below average quality, with few mushrooms and nothing else other than soy sauce.Service: Too few waiting staff for the number of tables. One dish got lost in the order, and was served very late after our reminder.Would we go back again? Not in a hurry. Not at busy times."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lunch ,40,05-24-17,"Well regarded restaurant with excellent Cantonese and Teochew food. Roast meats, teochew braised duck, pomfret fish porridge and yam desserts are exceptional."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Terrible Service and extra charges,20,03-01-17,"Crystal Jade has had a reputation for good dim sum dishes.The food is still quite good though below the standards it used to set.The BBQ pork roll and SiewMai we had were both quite tasteless,for instance.The service is terrible-the waitresses ignored us for as long as possible then were unhelpful when we made some simple questions about the dishes.The table was dirty and still not properly cleaned after they came to clean it.Annoying in particular were the extra charges.For instance we asked for two glasses of iced water (hardly San Pellegrino!) and we were charged for them.The rather tired pickles already on the table when we sat down were charged for,as were the paper towels."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average,30,02-07-17,"Standards keep dropping .... as they loss many of their Chef....
Service also varies between peak and non peak hours."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average place,30,01-26-17,The food is average. But unfortunately the service is lacking. They might need to train the non-chinese speaking staff to take orders better as they didnt get my order correct the first time.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Beef floating in fat,30,01-01-17,"Customer service is just terrible, there is maybe only one who really likes her job.. other don't smile, take orders in hurry, doesn't speak clearly etc.But it seemed they were extremely friendly for locals, who could speak Chinese..Also food quality compared to price is not good. My beef was floating in the fat and oil, and I just couldn't eat it.However fish and vegetarian food tastes very good! So I'll recommend to choose fish or vegetarian food, if you want to go there :)"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food. Just a little noisy,50,12-26-16,I've been here many times since I was a kid. And it has never changed. The Cantonese food here is decent for its price. But beware it's very noisy as people talk on top of one another. It's actually a very normal thing here. Also there are lots of kids that cry from time to time. So if you don't mind it all. Give this place a go!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dinner ,50,12-11-16,Excellent Chinese cuisine with very friendly staff and very prompt service. The dishes were fantastic and great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"After all these years, still good.",50,11-16-16,"This is my go-to place for comfort food. Quality consistently good over the past decade. Opens till after 12mn if I'm not wrong. My usual fav are the char Siew pastries, sweet and sour pork and clay pot eggplant."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dinner,40,10-07-16,"Great place for Cantonese casual dining with wide range of typical Cantonese dishes and dimsum dishes.
Prices are reasonable."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,INCREDIBLE!!!! - food that is good to the last drop,50,09-10-16,"The food here was incredible - and well priced. There was not one dish that was not absolutely delicious. I couldn’t stop eating - which is rarely something that happens to me. But it was just SO GOOD. The atmosphere and service leave something to be desired. But with food that good, who cares?!? We walked in on a Thursday evening and got a table without a wait."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food!,40,08-27-16,We have been going to Crystal Jade regularly and we never grow tired of the food they serve. It's delicious!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Still an enjoyable place for a weekend dim sum lunch,40,03-25-16,"Starting off as a single site, the Lorong Mambong branch now encompasses three separate but related establishments - two restaurants (Kitchen and La Mian Xiao Long Bao), and a bakery (My Bread). This review pertains to our recent visit to Kitchen for a extended family Sunday lunch. We've always enjoyed coming here and although there are some limited fan-cooled seats downstairs, we usually make it a point to get tables in the air-conditioned section upstairs. Reservations are taken except on Sundays, so come early...preferably before 11.30 am. Had a dim sum selection and while the standard's probably gone down somewhat over the years, it was still decent nonetheless. Service was basic but friendly, and I was accidentally splashed on my back with some ice water by the waitress but no harm done."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very good value for excellent quality Chinese,50,02-27-16,"Yes, of course this is one of many Chinese restaurants, and yes I know it is part of a chain of restaurants. And, for what it is, it think it is really good value and I love the food. The BBQ duck and pork options are yummy, the asparagus with mushrooms and truffle oil delicious, the salty fish rice delectable and I could go on. Don't forget to take your appetite!!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Salted egg xiao long bao & Chilli crab xiao long bao,50,01-27-16,"Food was good, especially Chilli Crab xiao long bao. If you do not exactly fancy spicy food, you could still give it a try.Salted egg xiao long bao was below my expectation, there were not much soup in each of the buns and the meat was kind of dry, compared to the usual xiao long baos.Ordered the La Mian with scallion and dong po rou as well and it made the trip there on a rainy day so much more bearable. It tasted heavenly! I could still remember that awesomeness 2 weeks now since I last had it.Great service, great food!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Crystal Jade @ Great World City,40,11-22-15,"The simple egg fried rice ranks supreme comparing with the once-renown Ding Tai Fung's @ Paragon Orchard ! Also, the vegetarian dumplings are as good as ever along with many other marvellous stir fried dishes and above all, diners are well attended to by sufficient crew... Never hesitate to have the next family lunch or dinner at this quality restaurant..."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Changes menu a lot,30,07-16-15,"I've been to Crystal Jade in Holland Village 5 times in the past 3 years. It is usually crowded during lunch time, when the air-conditioned room upstairs is open. They close it after 2 or 3pm, when it is less crowded and you'll have to dine downstairs (no air-conditioning, fans only). Food quality of dim sum (dumplings, congee etc) is good and authentic, close to what you'd get in dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. We liked their seafood fried cheongfun/horfun. Service was average during lunch hours (when they are busiest), slightly better later in the afternoon. I did find myself feeling abnormally thirsty after my most recent trip in July 2015, possibly due to increased MSG levels in the food."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Brunch,30,05-09-15,"Food was as good as expected. Crowded. Looks a bit understaffed. Though we were served, my request for a cup of cold water was not given even after I paid the bill."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Don't like new menu layout ,40,04-18-15,"It's our regular haunt every month and we've seen this place grow from start till today.Crystal Jade in Holland Village has gone through several changes over the years from changing their fresh dimsum to frozen and the latest 3rd menu change (which seems the most confusing).The food is the same good quality, albeit the menu needs some more thought. We were both turned off enough to lose a bit of appetite just making sense of it.We ordered their Braised Brinjal and Minced Pork, Deep Fried Salted Egg Prawns and Shrimp Wanton Soup.....the Salted Egg Prawns, the prawns separated too easily from the batter...... and rice wasn't too fresh tastingService slowed down due to new service staff. They need help."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Reliable Chinese restaurant,40,03-25-15,"Although this is a famous chain restaurant, the quality of foods is very reliable. Various dim-sum items and good environment inside the restaurant. Especially the duck foods are tasty and recommended."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Xiao Long Bao served were very nice and tasty. my daughter enjoy this as can't find any in Australia.,40,03-17-15,reasonable variety but some dishes price are on a high side. overall enjoy the dishes. just hope that they could have more variety cater to all the branches.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Rustic,30,02-18-15,"Crystal jade standards have certainly dropped over the years and Imperial Treasure is the chain to go for good chinese food. Anyway, we couldn't stand the line for kiddy Nakhon in holland village and popped by Crystal jade for the dinner alternativeit's chinese new year season so we ordered the yusheng and well as standard dishes - roast meat combo, stir fried vegetables, tofu in claypot and sweet and sour fish. They were all ok/average, and hence the problem for crystal jade. it's not enough to be just ok these daysOverall, a rustic, ok place for a meal. don't expect anything special"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food,40,11-19-14,It's a charm restaurant with good food. The food is Chinese Style but not oily and strong flavor like the normal Chinese food I tried in other restaurants. It tastes delicate.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Sad Chinese Meal,20,10-29-14,"We went to this restaurant late, maybe the staff was tired because we waited 20 mins to be seated despite the seats visibly available. Then it took a long time for some one to take our order, problem is they leave a menu and a sheet which you write the corresponding no. No one can explain the dishes.What we order was not available and what we finally got was pretty awful. It did not suit our taste. All in all it was a lousy dining experience in a fancy restaurant on our second night in Singapore. I would recommend you go there if you have someone who understands chinese food and who can help you order."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Not so nice food,30,09-28-14,"The foods are blunt.the dumplings look so aweful. But to be fair, service was quite ok so im giving it an average rating"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Chineses Cuisine,40,07-08-14,Try to eat at Crystal Jade Restaurant. The food are delicious and savory. The price is affordable too. Friendly and accommodating waitresses.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,'OUT OF SHAPE' DUMPLING,30,06-02-14,Visited the restaurant at Dhoby Ghaut 1 wk ago..Very disappointed with their dumpling..its not tasty and the glutinous rice is so soggy..it does not have the shape of a dumpling when opened..the rice is drooping and the ingredients esp the meat is not tasty.. Really not worth the money..Selling at $5.80!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Love the dim sum for lunch!,40,04-15-14,"Everytime we visit Singapore, we make this place a must stop for lunch. We always go during the work week so have no issues with reservations or service.The dim sum is very good! Also the fish congee and duck are nice as well."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,good food. poor service,30,03-02-14,"We just ate at Crystal Jade Holland Viilage (we have come here many times). This time we found the service to he horrible. We ordered egg tarts. They indicated that they no longer sell these. Instead we had to go to the Crstal Jade takeaway ourselves and bring to the table. When our food came, one dish was not what we intended. The waitress was quickly pointed out that we had disordered and forced us to take this dish rather what we wanted. Very disappointing."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,WestGate outlet staff chasing diner to finish meal,10,03-01-14,Poor service and staff keep asking to clear table even my daughter is eating and there are still food in the dishes. It is even more frustrating that a staff told us off that others are waiting !!We are only there for about an hour and the waiting time for food is longer than we enjoy it. The total bill for this dinner is sgd170 for 3 of us and we expect some minimum respect as a customer of Crystal Jade
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Authentic Cantonese,30,12-13-13,"There's nothing really special about the Clementi Mall Crystal Jade - crispy roast pork OK, diced pork & snake bean tasty but small serve, watercress soup was tasty but ordinary by Chinese standards, prawn with egg & broccoli a bit bland, the best dish was a silken tofu that you'd think was egg. A la carte price was fair but the set menu prices were exorbitant - much better value ordering a la carte. Service was prompt but disinterested."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Concerning,10,11-26-13,"I am conflicted about writing this but I feel too compelled that I must share our experience over the weekend. We have come here before and have found the food and ambiance to be quite nice but this past weekend was a different story.We arrived at 9:30am with our toddler and asked for one of the open tables. The hostess said they were out of many things and said we should look at the menu before we sit down. True enough they were but we said we wanted to sit anyway. We asked for one of the outside tables and were told they could not accommodate a third chair or high chair for the baby. We said ok and waited for an inside table and the hostess did nothing. We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside tables with just two seats and I would have the baby sit in my lap. The hostess then said not enough space (if you have seen the tables you know they are certainly large enough). it was very clear they didn't want us there and so we started to walk away and my wife then spoke in Chinese about how disappointed she was and the hostess looked shocked that my wife knows the language. We left and won't be back, but on the upside had an amazing breakfast at the Holland V hawker center. Truly a shame."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Hong Kong food affordable & tasty.,40,10-25-13,"The Good =)~Excellent chefs whip up great HK dishes.The Bad =(~Some dishes are meant for sharing & not for 1 pax, good to check with the waiter first.My Tip for future visits:~Try to avoid during dinner times which has a long wait."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Eating For Pleasure,40,09-06-13,The restaurant is situated in the upmarket Holland Village area and serves fresh authentic Chinese food.. The lotus root preparation is delicious and presentation is excellent. Its a dish we never fail to order.The Hor Fun is also tempting and the crispy pork is a great accompaniment. The sea coconut dessert is a sweet finale. There's a chain of Crystal Jade restaurants in Singapore and we make it a point to visit at least one of them when we are in the country.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great Authentic Chinese Food,40,09-03-13,"We had dinner with 4 friends. We ordered crispy pork, bbq pork, steam fish, fried kailan, duckegg battered prawns, fried rice, jelly fish. The food was awesome, pure authentic Chinese food. The service was good and the waitress was so superb that she even cover our bags with napkins so that they will not be stained in case accidentally, someone spilled the gravy on to our bags. The overall service as great. We love to dine in Crystal Jade whenever we arrive in Singapore."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,A restaurant with so much of tradition yet so different,40,06-24-13,"The restaurant serves mainly typical Chinese dishes but with a little extra touch in the preparation of food and reasonably good service quality, it is a pleasant place to have decent business lunch."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great Cantonese Food and Mid-day Dim Sum,50,04-23-13,"Fast efficient service and piping hot dishes make this a great place for a delicious Cantonese fare ""fix"" - Great for either lunch or dinner."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Nice Chinese food,40,04-18-13,"This has good Chinese dishes from dimsum to noodles, etc. But it is always crowded whenever we visit so prepare to queue and wait. Staff are helpful."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very popular with the locals,40,04-08-13,This group of restraurant ..have a wide range of cusine ..from very down to earth to the exotic ..better check on thier website before you head out ...extremely popular for familt celebrations
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lousy Service!,20,03-14-13,"This is probably the oldest and most established Crystal Jade, but now it's one of the most disappointing ""fine-dining"" outlets. It's ok that we have to queue for this seemingly popular restaurant, but to be ushered in like refugees, asked to order food quickly, and being served in a hurried manner AND worst of all, no smile, made one lose appetite. I'm not even talking about the weekend crowd! Worst of the lot are the managers dressed in black suits. The most friendly people are the older lady waiters. Food standards have also dropped, and mind you, I've eaten here since its opening!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dumplings and other asian treats,40,02-26-13,My son loves soup dumplings and Crystal Jade do them well. There is an excellent range of items to choose from and the pricing is good.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,A bit of Hong Kong in Holland Village!,50,02-17-13,"One of my favorite midnight haunts, Crystal Jade Holland V is the goto place for a bowl of steaming hot noodles & porridge. The beef brisket/tendon rice noodles( ngau lam hor) is outstanding. A bit more exotic is the carp fish skin; they used to serve it cold with sliced root ginger, scallions and peanuts, it's simply delicious!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Nice enough Chinese food,30,02-04-13,"Popular with locals, reasonably priced, straightforward Chinese food...
Would go there again if I was passing"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Chinese Cuisine - Dim sum,30,01-02-13,Had lunch there with friends. Food was just okay. Many variety sold out by noon on 27th Dec when I was there. Hong Kong style food. Located in few places in Singapore.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Exquisite Dim Sum,50,11-30-12,"To make this clear, the dim sum my family and I ate was at Crystal Jade Golden Palace Restaurant at Paragon (shopping centre) in Orchard Road. Today is the third time we've been here and it's never disappointed.The service is always good - they serve the food fast, clear the empty plates etc fast and your teapot gets refilled regularly. Speaking Mandarin helps since the servers' Mandarin proficiency is way higher than that of their English!Now...the FOOD:The Paos - the BBQ Pork Bun and the Custard Bao have very soft flour that melts in your mouth. The pork is tender and not too salty, but the best part is they got the balance of flour and meat just right. Though the custard pao is just as good, I still prefer the ones from The Cathay at Cathay (which is also along Orchard Road) because the filling has more of an egg taste.Ha Kau - the prawns are fresh and juicy; the flour is not too thick, is smooth and soft.Pan-fried carrot cake - I don't usually like carrot cake, but the way it's cooked doesn't make it too oily. It's just a little burnt, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Panda sweet potato paos - well because of Kai Kai and Jia Jia they have this. The buns look cute but my mum felt the sweet potato wasn't sweet enough. (What an irony.) I thought there was too much flour. It was ok overall.Chee chiong fan - the flour is really smooth and it can glide on your tongue! We've tried the prawn, pork and beef versions and they all taste good. (Plus I really like drinking the soy sauce.) The flour here is awesome!Mashed taro with pumpkin or more fondly known as Or Nee! - I've saved the best for last. This was the best or nee I've ever eaten because the yam paste was amazingly smooth and creamy (but not too thick) and the pumpkin pieces just collapse in your mouth when you chomp down on them. Yam affectionados, this is for you."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Excellent Chinese Food,40,11-21-12,Lots of Crystal Jade's around Singapore and can't say I have tried them all but all I have tried have been consistently good. Best to go in a group to try several dishes.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum in Singapore,40,11-05-12,"Great brunch place, a bit like Tapas but very Asian dishes.Nice ambiance, good service, could have been better if they were less stressed. Lots of dishes to choose from the menu and would actually advise if you've never had Dim Sum to go with someone local who knows what to order and maybe with a group. Eating alone is not much fun because the amount of the different dishes would be limited and expensive. Dim Sum is a meal you want to share with your family and friends, the more the merrier. Asians would normally order at least 10 different dishes and everybody share !!!Vegetarian food is available on the menu. Try the desserts too !! Enjoy !!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Just excellent!,50,10-11-12,"So there's a number of these in Singapore and I went to the one in Suntec.Service is very good, the setting is a contemporary Chinese feel, the food is to a very high standard and the staff are efficient. It's a good place for a business lunch as they don't hang around getting you your food, but equally don't hassle you out the door as soon as you're finished. Will definitely be there again (in two weeks in fact!)"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Just perfect!,50,09-12-12,"Like every year when I spend my vacation in Singapore I have to go to this restaurant. Typical local food, fast service and good quality. Just love this restaurant! Don't miss it!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,great place for tim sum,40,08-22-12,"make sure you try the pau, carrot cake, chicken feet, porridge, xiao long bao and glutinous rice. prices are reasonable. plain water is chargeable though. end the meal with a custard bun with fillings that flows out the moment you bite the bun. yum!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,You can't miss this restaurant,50,07-24-12,You will find different Crystal Jade restaurant in different mall in Singapore. You will taste Chinese cuisine. They have great choice for different taste.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Perfect Dim Sum,50,07-17-12,Probably my favourite place in Singapore for Dim Sum.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Home away from Home,50,07-11-12,"whenever I feel homesick, this is one place I will fill my stomach with food that reminds me of home"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good quality chinese food,40,06-17-12,During lunch they serve good quality dim sum. The standard is guaranteed at Crystal Jade. Service is also generally good. Would recommend their Korean Ginseng Chicken branches for a taste of Korean food
Chinese,Crystal Jade,We love Crystal Jade,50,05-28-12,"We love Crystal Jade - find it very difficult to walk past one without popping in for some xiao long bao.
Never disappoints and we've been to most of their outlets e.g. Holland Village, Velo, Orchard, Suntec, Central etc"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Must try more than once,40,05-13-12,For great Chinese food in Singapore must dine at Crystal Jade. This brand has many categories and please be sure of what you would like to eat and then choose an outlet accordingly. For me its always been a trial and error. There are certain outlets which have excellent Dim sums and yet some dont have iot on their menu.food is consistently good and the safest restaurant to go to for chinese cuisine. I would not pick on any one dish because everything on their menu is good
Chinese,Crystal Jade,No place better for chinese food,50,05-06-12,"We used to frequent Crystal Jade when we lived in Hong Kong and I was delighted that they are as popular a chain in Singapore as well. They have many different formats for their restaurants, ranging from the regular dining experience to formats which are slightly more expensive and better done up. The food remains consistently good whenever we go, and therefore this remains our first choice when we want to eat good cantonese food. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very good Chinese food,40,03-28-12,"If you are looking for fancy and good Chinese place , Crystal Jade is your place. A very good variety of chinese dishes and extremelly tasty."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,POOR POOR POOR SERVICE,10,03-26-12,"Dine at Crystal Jade, Takashimaya, Order a Chicken with wonton soup, a bowl of rice and a plate of two combination of char siew & roast pork but char siew of sold out so change to duck but wanted the lower portion, told her in mandarin, my goodness, the Manager told me she don't understand what is lower portion(in Mandarin). Then told her is alright, I shall canel the order for two combination, just the soup and a bowl of rice.Soup came, but not rice, so ask the Manager, she said ok will bring. Waited for 10 mins my little girl almost finished the soup and rice not here, went to check with the Manager again she said sorry she forgotten.The company should send their staff for training for service and name of the parts of the DUCK.If I have a choice, this outlet is OUT of my dining list."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Fast and decent Chinese food. Don't expect a long leisurely dinner!,30,03-19-12,"For fast and decent Chinese food in the ever-crowded Holland Village, it's hard to beat the massively popular chain, Crystal Jade. From fried rice to dim sum, it's consistently good and the service is wickedly fast. That means, however, you'd not be able to enjoy dinner in a leisurely manner, hold hands and stare into your spouse's eyes lovingly. It's strictly dine and dash here. It's my default place for Chinese food when in this area if the crowd gets a bit too much - which is often. You do have to wait on busy nights, but the lines do move pretty fast."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Food till late,40,02-18-12,Crystal Jade @ Holland opens till late. It serves good congee for those who suddenly have craving for it. CJ has a wide variety of delicious congee @ reasonable prices.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Peking Duck,30,02-09-12,"Love it there. Maybe because they do it the Cantonese way, maybe not the best around, but it could be the better ones you could get at that price. Worth a try."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Delicious Dim Sum and Porridge,40,01-20-12,"A good place for a quick fix for my porridge craving. Dim Sums are available during lunch only. Depending on the outlet you go, most of the service staff are friendly."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food!,40,11-29-11,"Crystal Jade Palace offers very good quality food though the price may be a bit steep.
Great ambience too."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Cantonese food,40,10-18-11,"Good food, good service, good selection of food and clean restaurant. I went here on a business lunch. It was a little noisy but still was conducive to conversation and business. I'd go back again."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,dim sum in Singapore?,40,10-11-11,"Prawn dumpling, common yet rather difficult to get good quality ones. This restaurant is one of few that we proud to recommend for dim sum breakfast. My kids love the steam prawn dumpling and my mum like the carrot cake. Our favourite is the outlet at Holland Village, you can dine in at 9am and still manage to get your supper at 1am in the morning!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,seems a bit worn and pushy,20,10-10-11,We found the staff to be prompt but pushy. They tried to upsell us on every item. for what we got it was expensive.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"A working man's restaurant, Chinese style",40,06-16-11,"My Chinese wife loves this place. I think that it reminds her of the old days. It is crowded, noisy, the tables are way too small for the number of dishes one orders, the waitresses are constantly putting dishes on the table or pulling them...More"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Better than average Cantonese dishes,30,05-10-10,My Chinese wife likes this place a lot. Personally I think it's good enough but I wouldn't distinguish it from many other Chinese restaurants. However I defer to her greater knowledge of the Chinese food scene in Singapore.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good and cheap food,50,10-23-09,We go to this restaurant to eat Chinese food and we like very much and very good value. We think this is good place for visitors in Singapore and our children also enjoy.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,What service?????,10,07-13-09,"A very strange experience indeed. We walked in to a 10% filled restaurant and there were lots of waitresses standing around. Menu was quickly placed on our table, after a few minutes, no one asked if we were ready. Another few minutes, we got impatient...More"

(They cancel 1 of the desserts that was once in my 'must order' list). The menu features a few different types of ramen. However when we try to order them, The waitress notify us that they only serve the normal ramen. The standard is as normal. The desserts variaties is reduced, I managed to try the rice wine dumplings though and it turns out to be quite unexpected. As in the rice wine smell was quite strong and different from what I had outside. But overall it is quite ok."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,30,08-07-18,"As a Cantonese, average dimsum cannot really be tolerated. Below are those I have eaten:-1) Chee Cheong Fun - Unacceptable skin smoothness, it's rough and I can't even eat it .2) Char Siew Pau - It looks presentable but it's all pastry (flour) and limited meat. 3) Prawn Wanton Crisps - Will never order again. Fillings not solid.4) Meat Dumpling in Chilli Oil - Should be renamed to Meat Dumpling in Vinegar which is all to it. What's Good/Acceptable1) Egg Tart2) Mango Pudding (Slightly on the sweeter side)3) Xiao Long Bai - Rough skin but love the element of rice wine.4) Xiao Mai and Har Gao - Solid and tasty. 5) Double Boiled Soup - Yummy!6) Leaned Meat with Century Egg Congee - OkI won't list it all down. Go give it a try if you are a Safra Member or Maybank Card Holder. We came for High-Tea Buffet and we are satisfied. Value for money. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious & reliable ,40,07-23-18,"One of the few places left in Singapore with trolley service yum Cha, this is a busy and delicious set up. Good selection of steamed and other dim sum as well as all the usual suspects in Yum Cha. Loud, busy and great for groups- you come here for a good time not a long time! Get there early or late if you don’t want to have to queue!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,50,07-19-18,"Yummy yummy yummy especially dimsum, all staffs and service was very good also. I like everything here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great lunch ,50,07-15-18,"We have just had the best Yum Cha in Chinatown in Singapore. Great food, fried noodle scallops, fried crab claws,Beijing duck,roasted pork all really good. Can highly recommend this experience in Chinatown."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha worst ever experience,10,07-14-18,"I think a lot of customers will regret coming to this restaurant like myself and my family. The food is average and the service is extremely bad, especially when taking away the leftovers, they will lump everything into one box of different varieties like junk. When approach the stuff, they responded with very bad attitude and forcing us to accept their insincere apology. BE CAREFUL of coming to this place."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Tasty food , decent crowds on a sunday 10am morning ",40,07-01-18,"Family decided to venture to Chinatown for Yum Cha at 10am Sunday morning and was not disappointed. There was no queue but still fairly crowded. Food was great , and had alot of variety with the waiters and waitresses pushing carts of dim sum goodness ! New for this mth includes Bak kut teh Xiao Long Bao which was tasty . If you have a craving for dim sum , pls visit Yum Cha at China town , you will leave the place satisfied ! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,20,06-29-18,Foods taste average. Nothing much special. Environment is a bit smelly unsure why. Not crowded. Easy accessable. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Ok - quite heavy ,30,06-25-18,In fairness we may have made poor choices! The dim sum did seem to be more substantial than flavourful. Nice environment and staff.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Awesome Dim Sum Buffet, great value, nice ambience n great attentive staff",40,06-22-18,"Not my first visit to Yum Cha Restaurant, happy that food and service still good. The aunties were very nice and attentive to my kids, ensuring food are served fast so that wont get hungry. Nice variety of dim sums, love most of the items. We enjoyed it. Would be nice if they can have family buffet rates/sets. Think kids do not eat too much so buffet price is slightly high, but overall experience, good!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Dim Sum Restaurant,50,06-21-18,A real treat if your visiting China Town. Its located on 2nd floor. A true foodie pit stop you must experience.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,????? ??? ??? ???,50,06-01-18,"????? ??? ?????? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ! ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ??? ???!I must compliment Ms Siew Lan, she was very helpful and we are highly touched with her kind service. We definitely will visit again!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced and overrated ,20,05-28-18,"After a number of recommendations, we went to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered 3 dumpling dishes, a roast pork dish, vegetables and drinks.I’ve had MUCH better food in Sydney for a much cheaper price in very much nicer surroundings. In fact, I’ve had way better dumplings at our Thursday night street markets.To add insult to an already poor meal, we ordered a glass of beer each that turned out to be $10.50. EACH!Even worse, we were given a bowl of peanuts (not requested) and a packaged wet wipe each (also not requested) and upon reading our payment receipt, found we were charged for these items. There were no napkins provided at the table.The decor is old and depressing and everything just looks and feels like the place has seen long gone, much better days. We’ve eaten at all kinds of street vendors throughout SE Asia, we’re definitely not picky, fussy customers but I can also say that we’ve enjoyed a $10 meal 100 times more than we enjoyed this.Don’t waste your time or money, we just wasted $90 so that we can save anyone reading this from wasting their money too."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum on wheels,20,05-28-18,The unique selling point is the dim sum trolleys which brought back nostalgic memories when I was a child in Hong Kong. But that’s about it. The food is pretty average. The place is a bit tattered. Staff not particularly responsive. Any novelty value wears off very quickly. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selection of tasty food,40,05-19-18,"After a morning at Gardens by the Bay, my group of eight was famished. So we cabbed it to Yum Cha where we ordered so much food we were afraid we had overdone it. We hadn't. We ate it all. My mouth is watering remembering the meal. Four stars instead of five because service was a little chilly and a couple of dumplings were a little gummy (but we were at end of lunch service, which may have contributed to that)."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum at its Best so far,40,04-28-18,"After 30 plates of these Dim Sum, we could hardly use words to describe.We give 2 thumbs up, for the variety, freshness, taste & services provided by the staff.Started with 10 bamboo containers all steamed to perfect hotness that even the soup base & prawns within the dumplings are fresh.The place was unassuming, on the 2nd floor but the number of tables occupied tells the tale this weekday afternoon, its now 3 o'clock.the clock reads 5.10 & yet 2 families streamed in with buffet orders.Our last order for desserts & that of the others were all served with smiles by the various staff & Mr Ken Wong stands out asking if we will like to top up the buffet spread.Our teeth is tired could not grind anymore & the stomach says stop.We will be back, Wifey beckon but with our parents & family next.The tea costing $3.50 was superior even for me (tea lover of over 5-8 cups daily).consider this as Hi-tea."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good quality dim sim,40,04-16-18,"Been here a few times whenever I’m in Singapore, and haven’t been disappointed. For a change their congee with century eg is pretty god, and so is their chinese turnip cake. I can’t fault their service, which is generally fast and efficient and that’s it. It’s in an interesting part of town and the atmosphere is genuinely good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Roast pork was disappointing,30,04-16-18,"Brought some friends from Switzerland for lunch there. Most of the dim sum were good except for the roast pork. The skin was not crispy at all and the meat was 80% fat and 20% lean.
Prices were a little on the high side."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum in China town,40,04-15-18,A lot of variety of dim sum to choose from. Food is delicious. But be prepared to queue for one hour. Price is reasonable.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Went downhill,30,04-05-18,"We used to live in Singapore three years ago, and Yum Cha was one of the places we'd go to get good local Chinese food. The atmosphere used to be lively, as it was full of people. The food was still good, but there were only three other tables occupied throughout the time we were there for dinner. There are better places to go now. Sadly, it is not like it used to be."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Underwhelming - there must be better restaurants in China Town,30,03-06-18,I was really underwhelmed about this restaurant which is a shame as there are so many other places nearby which I passed to get here!The restaurant is well signed posted but so be sure to look up as the restaurant is located on the second floor. It has air conditioning which is a plus.The staff were as helpful as they could be given that their English was so limited. We struggled but found a way to communicate.I found the food very oily. My spring rolls were literally dripping with oil which was not very appetizing. As for for the rest - it was okay - average at best.I would not return simply because there are better places out there.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Attentive service and nice ambience ,50,02-23-18,"We happened to dine here as Tak Po is closed down, and we enjoyed our lunch a lot. During CNY there are many ppl doing “lo hei” thus the restaurant is quite noisy. This is how new year supposed to be . Dim sum was serviced with trolleys, they approach the table very frequently and friendly enough to show and explain to us. You can see the restaurant signage from far. However it’s on the second floor thus it may be a bit tricky to find the entrance. I enjoyed the squid dumpling (I can’t remember the name , it’s black color dumpling ) the most You can inform the staff to remove the peanuts when it’s serviced at the beginning if you don’t need it. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,lolno,10,02-02-18,"Terrible service. Not the impressive Yum Cha I remembered. We had not enough chairs for our group of 6, no space because the other table had their bags on a chair right next to our table, unable to move back because the tea/cutlery station was next to us. When we told the service staff, she basically gave us zero solutions. Move tables? Nope. Shift ours back? Nope. Tell the other group to move their bags? Nope, she actually said, “what do you want me to do?”. I legit just told you what to do!As if the experience isn’t bad enough, 2 of our ordered items wasn’t keyed in. Felt like I was boiling so much throughout the entire meal I was going to get indigestion. Why am I paying service charge?? I might as well go to a coffee shop jfc. Save yourself the headache and monies and go to Swee Choon instead. This place is going downhill. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,We were underwhelmed,30,01-25-18,"We ate here as a part of a tour, so had a set menu, which may explain our rating. Other diners appeared to be enjoying their food more than we did. The set menu had the usual suspects: a soup, a chicken with sauce dish, a fish with vegies and sauce, pork fried rice, a broccoli dish, and a mango pudding for dessert. The food was not bad, just uninspired, as was the service. I would hope that one could do better in Chinatown in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best dim sum meals I’ve had ,50,01-20-18,"A friend in Singapore recommended this place and I wasn’t disappointed. They kept bringing round dim sum on trolleys and it was very reasonably priced, spacious and air conditioned. Definitely worth the short wait to get in."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum lunch,20,01-20-18,"Great service unfortunately matched with bad dim sum. Cold roast, soft spring roll skins, badly done up dumpling soup etc doesn’t justify the 30% higher price there. De Bao Dim Sum at the adjacent street is so much better."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible dim sum and poor value!,10,11-30-17,"I went here after reading the mainly good reviews on TA. I found this place to offer very poor value for money and the dim sums themselves lacked flavour with very small portion sizes and fillings. I mean, I’ve had better dim sum all the way in the U.K. If this place is meant to be one of the better dim sum places in Singapore then I’m afraid you are better of choosing a different cuisine. I spent $20 on three dim sums and a soft drink for myself. Whilst it may seem like good value compared to the U.K., believe me, it isn’t. They make up for it with the size and quality of the dishes. The glutinous rice was a joke. Hardly any filling, the rice was mushy more than glutinous and it was tiny, half the size of a playing card. Much better food around in China Town. Hey, go to the award winning and Michelin Star, Hawker Chan place two minutes walk away where an excellent meal there will set you back $3; yes, three dollars. That just puts things into perspective. Avoid Yum Cha. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,So terrible very bad,10,11-20-17,"We were recommended to go by our hotel concierge. We were very disappointed with the food, and the service the staff could not care less. When ordering for myself, and my husband I wanted vegetarian food this is what we asked for at the hotel. The meal was under the bean curd section but contained pork. When I asked the staff member she just smiled even laughed. I have never eaten meat in my whole life I knew something was wrong. I am so upset, and unwell due to never having meat. If you want a good resurant with vegetarian food don't go. If you want good service don't go, and if you want a good atmosphere don't go. All I can say is don't go"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Right place to try Dim Sum in singapore,50,11-16-17,"With review from trip advisor wanted to try some original dim sum . The ones we get in India are the indianised version with 3 choices .( steamed fried or Schzwan ) . We tried 5 of the numerous choices ( Xiao Long Bao ,Fish Roe with Siew Mai ,Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ,Fried Carrot Cake , and a green colored open looking one forgot the name ). The Crab meat with Thick Corn Soup was plenty for us a family with 2 kids . we also had Braised Ee-Fu Noddles and the total bill after tips was 80 SGD . Most of the crowd where locals and YUM CHA is placed partly hidden in china street . But if you can look in google street view in maps I think you can easily locate the place . except for the fried carrot cake and the endless jasmine tea we loved all the food . it is an excellent try out for anyone looking for exceptional food in Singapore . The asst captain( as the badge read ) was a pleasent and very helpful girl and the atmosphere can't be better as we are in china town .You are reminded that it is china town so don't expect plates forks knifes e.t.c . When in Rome be a Roman . I looked at the way the locals where eating with chopsticks and bowl and followed suit ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Cashier’s service / image was a flop,30,10-15-17,"Cashier for that day was unfriendly.We arrived with no staff at the entrance and I went to the counter to ask for a table and she totally ignored me! And when we’re paying the bill,she was totally arrogant!Blessings were the serving staff were great!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Dim sum ok, don't bother with a la carte",20,09-07-17,We went on a busy bank holiday and were seated within 30mins. Not bad. The dim sum trollers were great and the food was nice. Problem started when we ordered a la carte. The sweet and sour pork was tasteless and sauce very greasy. We wondered if the pork was cooked thoroughly because it had a funny texture. A member of our group vomited after the meal so sure the pork was not cooked properly. The spicy Aubergine hotpot was not spicy and again lots of oil and cornstarch. Don't order a la carte there and stay away from pork.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,reasonable and good taste,40,08-30-17,This restaurant is very reasonable in this expansive city. There are lots of variety in food served by wagons in an old style.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum breakfast ,30,08-27-17,"It was my first time visiting this restaurant. It is was recommended by my Friend.

Even the table was not stable..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Average food, expensive price, revolting toilets",20,07-29-17,"Food and service ok
Very pricey
Disgusting toilets
You can find better dim sum experience in the area."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was good but food was disappointing,20,07-07-17,"Visited this place today for their dim sum.. was disappointed as it doesn't taste nice maybe not up to my expectation. The texture and overall was kinda bad.. I read some of the review saying the ha gao and siew mai was nice but it really is not, except of the prawn filling which was fresh. I didn't try the rest of dishes though, maybe will visit another time for the dishes but never coming back for the dim sum."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice dim sum,40,07-06-17,"Sui mai and ha gao are quite nice. But what I like most is chicken cooked in paper,chicken wings are tender and sauce is tasty,I can feel a scent of ginger and soya sauce."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dinner Gathering TPL,40,07-02-17,"Simple team dinner @ Yumcha, the Service staff was quite friendly and helpful with all our requests."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The quality of the food has dropped by a lot!BBQ,20,06-28-17,"Went to Yum Cha in Chinatown for lunch today with the family. I had tasted good dim sum there before and was expecting more or less the same.Unfortunately, today's lunch of dim sum was anything but nice. The seafood fried rice was tasteless, so was the BBQ Pork Rice Flour Roll.The deep fried dishes of Fried Carrot Cake and Sesame BBQ Pork Pastry were cold. Probably cooked earlier and left on the service counter for too long.Basically, if this is the standard now, I strongly won't recommend anyone to spend your money there."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service average. Food ok,30,06-24-17,"Unable to understand... by adding order, we just need to fill in used paper forms & the service folks will know the difference. They lecture us ""There's no need to inform them"". ... Mmmm???... Super Power! p.s. The extra food filled in the used paper form did not arrive. Ha! wonder why... lolz"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Better than average,40,06-19-17,Food was good. Not too crowded. More on the pricey side though. Quite small serving for the porridge.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Father's Day ,30,06-18-17,"Came here for Father's Day treat. The 3 basic requirements for a Dim Sum Restaurant are pork dumplings (Xiu Mai), shrimp dumplings (Har Kau) and Braised Chicken Feet (Feng Zhao) to taste the freshness of pork, shrimp and chicken. Had good meals at this restaurant before. Was surprised that the Xiu Mai is still ok but the Feng Zhao is tasteless. Off day for the Chef?"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Horrible,10,06-15-17,"Horrible cheap dim sum with horrible service and dirty ambience.
If you are short of cash and want some dim sum, you can come here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food but below average service :(,30,06-11-17,"The food is good given the price paid! However, the service staff was unprofessional and rude. They're unwilling to serve and zero smiles on the face. Well, I'm there for the food and to allow my grandma to enjoy so I chose to let it go for the time being."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not too bad,40,06-11-17,"Decided to bring my colleague since it's her first time in Singapore for some dim sum. There was a short line and around a 15 minute waiting time before we were seated. Because we went on a Saturday, the buffet was sadly not available.My favourite was the dumpling with fish maw at the base. Because items are pushed around in trolleys, we mainly grabbed what ever looked good without knowing the names. The soup dumpling though was quite disappointing because it lacked flavour and the skin was really thick. Overall it wasn't too bad. Not the worst but not the best either."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Questionable Hygiene Standard.,10,05-24-17,"I was at Yum Cha, Chinatown SG, for lunch with my spouse on 23 May 2017. After placing our dim sum order, I proceeded to the washroom at about 12:45 pm to wash my hands as habitual before my meal.In the washroom, I noticed a Yum Cha staff coming out a toilet cubicle and just rinsed his fingers tip quickly at the wash basin next to me. He did not bother to use soap and to wash his hands thoroughly. There was a poster on the wall next to the basins with pics and instructions, apparently for staff, how to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and wash after using the toilet. When he saw me looking at him with disbelief, all he did was smiled and walked out.I am not sure if he handles food there. But with that attitude in my presence as the customer, I wondered what he would do if he was alone with no one watching.Needless to say, I did not enjoy my lunch after that.I always thought Yum Cha served quite good dim sum. Now I have great doubts about the standard of staff discipline and hygiene. Yum Cha?, never again!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good restaurant for dim sim lovers near Chinatown,40,05-19-17,The bill for 4 is from 70 to 100 SGP including refilled Jasmine tea. Good place to have lunch while other restaurants open after 12 which is quite late for my stomach. Try Crispy salmon skin and Shark fin with meat dumplings.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese Dim Sum,30,04-30-17,"Variety of Chinese dim sum food to choose from, generally the taste is good however I feel that the food quality has slightly dropped over the years.They offer the trolley service where typically they will prepare popular dishes and wheel them around the dining area, where diners may choose to have as many plates from the trolley service (dish is priced as in the main menu, normally without discount). This might be a good idea if the crowd is large and your order might take awhile to come.Service has been generally good, however waiting time for the staff might be longer if there is a large crowd.Note:The lift has been noted to be spoilt for a long time, unaware if it has been fixed but do not take your chances if a member is not good with stairs. As noted by the other reviews."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great,40,04-30-17,"Dim sum are yummy. Must try stem pork ribs, tenderror and juicy. Definitely will come back again for the good dim sum."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Love the dim sum trolley service,40,04-20-17,"Now that trolley service has all but disappeared on the London dim sum scene it was a real treat to see it in action in Singapore. A decent selection of both steamed and fried dim sum, the usual suspects like ha gau and siu mai but a few unusual dishes I had not seen before too. If you couldn't see what you wanted on the trolley just ask and it would emerge from the kitchen. Portion wise its like it used to be in London about 30 years ago but where London got smaller these portions remained ample!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special,30,04-01-17,We love Yum cha and whilst what we had was OK we expected better. Yum Cha in Auckland NZ is a lot lot better quality. As other reviewers have noted the escalator is still not fixed and the entrance to the restaurant is off a side street amidst stalls up a steep flight of stairs.l;The trolleys come around and you can pick what you want. We asked for bar b cue pastries and prawn rice rolls and they came nice and hot. The har gau were OK and we liked the scallop and pea dumpling which was the highlight. We didn't like the Dan (egg) tart too sweet for us and not a good texture. A very busy restaurant with fairly impersonal service. We had to queue for over 10 minutes to pay the bill no idea what they were doing. There are much better YUM Cha restaurants than this one.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum,20,03-28-17,"The restaurant was located at the second floor of the shophouse. Although it was weekday, it was packed with lots of tourists. Menu was a single 2 sided tick list. I was showed to a table by the window. Although there was power under the table, it was not working. So don't plan to charge your hp while eating.Pumpkin Yam Golden Cake ????? (S$4.20++/ 3pcs)The texture was not bad with its crispy top, but it was a tab jelat if having more than a piece and quite oily towards the end. Taste was one dimension.Squid Ink Dumpling ????? (S$4.80++/ 3pcs)The folds wasn't perfect. One piece wasn't even folded in.Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ????? (S$5.20++/ 3pcs)There's holes in the dumplings. I was surprised to find this kind of standard in their signature dumplings.Home-made Almond Tea ??? (S$4.20++)The texture wasn't rich and creamy. It looked kind of like the instant type - sweet and lumpy. Service was spotty. I was told to go to the cashier when I asked for the bill. I could spot customers with their bills served to them at their tables. Also spotted that the next table of Japanese customers had a piece of plastic in his glass of beer. The staff who cleared the glass blamed on the plastic covering the ice cubes, but did not apologize. One could see clearly that the group of customers was clearly upset. Although the customer was later told by another staff that the glass of beer would be waived from the bill, the damage had already been done."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food and good services,40,03-24-17,But the restaurant did not received my chope reservation. Luckily there are enough seats for 7 of us.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but....",30,03-18-17,"Visited this restaurant ten years ago and had happy memories. This visit found the food much the same. A good selection of yum Cha and mains. Service was adequate and fast. We arrived late morning and by the time we left, about 1.00pm, the tables were mostly taken. Entry to this restaurant can be confusing as the street entrance is hidden under a covered footpath which is crowded by stalls. Walk up a flight of stairs and follow your nose to enter the restaurant. One big complaint is that when my wife went to the restroom she returned saying it was very dirty and she would need to seek another restroom. I visited the gentlemen's and found the same although I managed a successful visit. Some Asian countries are known for poor lavatory management and it was a surprise to find this in a well established restaurant in Chinatown. On the basis of the restrooms, we would not return and recommend only if you have a strong bladder"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not memorable,20,03-11-17,"Service was not great, and variety is limited....no signature dish to look forward to....elevator was not functioning so my 90 years old father had to climb the tall stairway"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice ambience,50,02-26-17,"Good food and nice ambience, highly recommend the xiao long bao! Service was good and the staff were friendly and helpful in recommendation of dishes"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Noisy busy and crowded for lunch – with very good food,40,02-26-17,"This is a great place for dim sum, but not if you’re a novice. It’s too crowded to bring around carts so you can see what you’re getting. So you order everything off a paper menu by noting how many of a particular dish you want. So if you don’t mind the noise and can go with someone who knows their way around dim sum, the food is excellent."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was impeccable!,50,02-20-17,"We had a good quantity of dim sum and we spent considerable amount of time in the restaurant. I must say, the service was simply impeccable. They took care to attend to every single detail; including ensuring that we ate the item while it was hot; and ensuring that our tea cups were always filled. I was impressed and touched."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Disappointed, not as good as it used to be...",20,02-11-17,"Went back here for lunch after first couple of meals here on a previous trip... While ok, it was a disappointment this time, with a vastly reduced Yum Cha menu, most of the common favourites are gone, not to be found... Sad! The place has become a little tired. If you are after great or even good food, don't go here, seek out other options in Singapore. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you like dim sum,40,02-11-17,"If you are a dim sum amateur, here is a restaurant for you in the heart of Chinatown not far from the interesting Chinatown heritage center.Essentially patronized by locals, there are few foreigners which is a good indication.I loved the scallops and green peas dim sum as well as the traditional siu mai.When you arrive at your table ask for the illustrated menu if you are not familiar with the food and fill up the form and waive it to the waiter. Service is minimal and the cashier doesn't even look at you ! But the lunch was an enjoyable classic."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,fabulous dimsum,50,02-08-17,"We went there near to chinese new year and we almost did not found the entrance who is surrounded by shops . Plenty of yummy Dimsum of all sorts . This is not a fancy restaurant , its quite noisy , but its clean , the service is good , and you will pay about 15dollars , not more ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,40,02-03-17,"We went here twice and enjoyed dim sum. The restaurant is usually quite crowded but I don't believe you need reservations. Lots of choices and the prices are reasonable. It is located in Chinatown. It is a little hard to find but follow the ""tea cup"" symbols which are their logo. It is on the second floor of a building."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown food,40,01-28-17,"Shaky staircase leads into a bustling restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Carts in the room, laden with baskets pork ribs with sweet potatoes, yams and samami dim sum with shrimp and spinach make an impression even on those who are Asia - a sweet home."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit of a let down,20,01-23-17,"We are a fan of dimsum having had these since we were young. The typical Chinese dishes you'll see in the Philippines. We also have done a lot of dimsum exploration in HK.Being in the CNY season, we wanted to have dimsum and a walk around Chinatown. Yum Cha is very popular.The ambiance is close to HK dimsum places with the noise, push cart food and most servers speaking only Chinese The food looked authentic. But the taste was far from our expectations. The siomai were the best and that's the only one that got a repeat order. Everything else was just to try and unfortunately, no repeat. To be clear, the dimsum was not bad. Just that the expectations to be the same as authentic HK dimsum was not met.Quite a pricey place too with dished between $4-5 per plate."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special ..,20,01-22-17,I have been brought to this restaurant in Chinatown twice by 2 different tour guides so I assume that it must have been popular and good at one time. However on both occasions the food was a letdown and the ambience very average. So I don't understand why the tour guides keep bringing us here. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch ,30,01-02-17,Used to visit this restaurant quite often but today is a let down cos both lift and escalator were out of order and my father in law had to struggle to reach the place in second floor . Food still ok but the place is jammed pack . Food served at quick pace though crowded 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best places to eat in Chinatown,50,12-27-16,"I've read some articles about this restaurant, and convinced me to give it a try. It is located among the major streets in Chinatown area. The ambience is not that attractive, however people keep on coming back for its taste. I highly recommend the xiao long bao, and their garlic pork."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,20,12-06-16,"This is a restaurant I really look forward to going to, however this time it was very disappointing. They charged for the nuts on the table and even for the hand towels. The service was so slow that I had to get up several times and make the waiters come over to our table. The person behind the bill counter was so slow it made me think that she was putting on an act. Food was average and a bit expensive. I ordered a fried rice five times and it took twenty minutes by which time my three year old was hysterical, I ended up having to take it with me. Last time I was here I would have rated it a four at least."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum high tea time,30,12-05-16,We were on our honeymoon when we visited Singapore in Jan 2015 (can't change the year so have put 2016) and this was our first meal that we had picked prior to coming to the city. It was very highly rated among others in Chinatown so we decided to give it a try. We tried a lot of their dimsum and it was good but I wasn't impressed. Service was also a bit slow so I was little annoyed. Overall i'd say it was an Ok meal.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent choice for dim sum,30,11-12-16,Tried the main outlet in Chinatown for lunch this week. We had 6 different dim sum options and some porridge - all were pretty good and the service was quite efficient. Not too crowded on a Friday lunchtime so no need for a reservation. Worth another visit.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Enjoyed the High Tea Buffet,30,11-08-16,"+ eat all you can dimsum and chinese desserts
+ walking distance to Chinatown train station
- pricey at SGD24 per person excluding tax
- can be hard to locate the shop"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice and cheap. Taste wise quite ok,30,11-06-16,The food is not bad. The price is cheap and with Safra card you get 30% off on weekday evening. The place is average but it's on 2nd level but the elevator is faulty.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Peking Duck,40,10-18-16,"Had the peking duck. They offer a half duck order so it was just right for me. They come to the table to carve it up and make wraps for you. They did it a little differently though, they rolled a piece of skin with with a pretty large chunk of green onion and cucumber. I would have much preferred if they julienne the green onion into small pieces. The duck also didn't have much flavor compared to other times I've had it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious Dim Sum,30,10-04-16,"Dim sum, Chinese restaurant.Mrt Chainatown Exit AGo straight on Pagoda street until you find T-junction and turn right. Go straight on to intersection. Look at Orange roof. The restaurant is the 2nd floor. Fish Roe Siew Mai (??????), Mango & prawn sesame flitters, Xiao Long BaoRecommend >>> Chinese tea"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food bad service,20,09-17-16,"Lunched at Yum Cha today and while the food was tasty, service was terrible. Seemed only interested in having you eat what was available immediately on the cart rather than ordering anything else - even though on menu."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Dim Sum,30,08-27-16,"Foods were average, location at level 2 easy to find the place
Staff with flat face was servicing us.
The place is good to pit stop for snacking..before you continue your exploration at famous Chinna Town."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special,30,08-22-16,"The price is reasonable. However, food is not fantastic at all. I believe what you pay is what you get. The place is very warm as well despite having fans around."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth traveling to wait in a queue,20,08-14-16,"I don't like to give any poor marks in my reviews, but I can't help it this time.This restaurant has received many good reviews on the Tripadvisor, and was acclaimed for offering good food for reasonable prices in the guidebook we brought. As we stand in line to get a table, I saw people apparently from all over the world as well as locals; my expectations for their food were raised.However, as another reviewer commented, the atmosphere was like a busy factory. It didn't look particularly clean. As we sat at a table, a waitress busily brought us a pot of tea and wet paper napkins along with a menu. What surprised me later was that the tea and the napkins were chargeable; we certainly didn't order them in the first place! The pot of tea turned out to be the most expensive item on the bill at 5.40 SGD.The food quality was okay. As they offered dishes off the pushcart, we didn't bother to look at the menu. The prices of the dishes ranged from 3.80 to 4.80. Some people say their dim sums are of the top quality; I thought they were just above the average. The service charge of 10% was added at the end though I didn't feel we had received any special ""service"" to speak of. After all, you wouldn't be met with much smile at all, and the unasked-for items are charged.Does the total cost of 42.50 SGD for seven dim sum dishes (and tea and towels) sound reasonable? I just don't know.On the way back, we saw many other good-looking, cleaner eateries with smiling wait staff in the China Town. Why not give it a try at another restaurant next time? Would I come back to this restaurant in my future visits to Singapore? Definitely no."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tim sum in China town,40,07-29-16,"Excellent tim sum in an old house in the center of China town. The quality remains equal through the years, i have never been desppointed. Efficient service. I recommand this restaurant for a genuine Chinese dinner"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worst experience ever !,10,07-29-16,"Four of us entered the resturant for a meal, we decided the meals were a little too expensive for us so just ordered four entrees and a jug of tiger beer (equals 4 glasses at a cost of $38 for the jug).There were few meals that were reasonably priced but they ranged up to $160 +The staff were so rude we decided to leave, i usually read reviews like mine & think that maybe it is the customer that is the issue as i have never had an experience like this before, we would have stayed & paid the high prices but decided we could not put up with the staff & the fact there was no atmosphere what so ever. We were also brought a small dish of peanuts which we thought were complimentary as with the servettes placed on the table, when paying we were shocked to find a charge of $2 for the peanuts & $1.20 for the servettes, when questioned the lady at the register said it was not much for the peanuts etc, i replied the issue was we were not advised that we were being charged for same.Will not recomend this resturant or go back, ever !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Delicious food, nonsense service",30,07-28-16,"This family favorite place would've gotten 4 stars from me if their service wasn't atrocious. We like coming for the weekday high tea buffet once in awhile because their dim sums are above average and their price is super value for money. We went again yesterday, the 7 of us. It was pretty crowded and though there were many many staff, all of them managed to not see any patrons in the restaurant. And when I did get the attention of one (for maybe some sauce or tea), they would push responsibilities back and fourth to each other until it didn't come, or we get our item after we finished our dumplings. We were rudely told to wait quite a number of times, and a paper literally shoved in my face telling me to ""circle what I wanted"" cuz she couldnt be bothered to listen to and remember my order. We were also told to wait and get things from the push carts even though we ordered after we didn't see the items we wanted on the pushcart. So we waited and nothing came out. There are a TON of things on the menu that you must order because they don't come on the pushcarts. I think they just put the most popular things on the carts and hope you don't order more. But the buffet does promise some 65 items or so. And even then we would order 2 baskets of something (because there are 7 of us) and yet only 1 would arrive. The a la carte service is slightly better, though not a whole rating point better. Service aside, the food is worth coming for, which is why we do."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinese food ,40,07-27-16,"We were looking to just have some Dim Sum for dinner in Chinatown, and decided on this one based on a combination of location (from where we were) and menu. We just ordered nine different dishes and shared everything.I especially enjoyed the Scallop Pea-shoot Dumplings and Prawn & Mango Sesame Fritters. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Rude manager,20,07-26-16,"Food delicious but Manager attitude was terrible.We brought our overseas relatives to lunch at Yum Cha Chinatown Restaurant.We were assigned to the table beside a cabinet which initially we thought is for decoration purpose.Suddenly, a Manager in white polo shirt went to open the cabinet, he didn't tell us to give way. Instead he chase away our elderly guest who was sitting closest to the cabinet without waiting for her to stand up and move. Luckily she did not get hurt from this sudden action.The manager even blamed her for sitting there and blocking his way. Since the restaurant assigned us that particular table and we sat as per their seat arrangement, why are we blamed for sitting next to the cabinet?If this cabinet need to be opened often, why they set the seat just besides it? If due to space constraint, manager should know that this condition is not customer's fault."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum,40,07-21-16,"Really large range of Dim Sum, all that we tasted were excellent. Service was fast. Bit of a tricky place to find, but worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Yum Cha,30,07-19-16,Good Yum Cha but can get busy. best times to go - 11am and after 3pm. Seafood is good and tasty. Can order off menu - but need to ask staff - prawns very great. Warning - you have to pay for peanuts and towelettes
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Again a great meal,40,07-09-16,"Second visit and didn't disappoint, great yum cha food with a good variety and quick service, fun and full of atmosphere."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not bad,40,07-04-16,"The staff were very attentive and food wasn't bad. Very near MRT and not too crowded. Not exactly cheap, but good variety and service was good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Worth a visit,40,07-01-16,"This is a very pleasant and bustling restaurant in Chinatown that should certainly be visited at least once, as they accommodated us well. The air conditioned dining area has a casual feel and attentive, if slightly pushy, staff that endeavour to please, even if they do not sometimes understand exactly what you want.We ordered creamy corn soup, wok fried chicken with stir fried local vegetables and scrambled egg and the stir fried fish fillet which were piping hot, good portioned and served without waiting too long."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Our Favourite Dim Sum Place in China Town - Breakfast,40,06-28-16,"No Doubt you can find many other dim sum restaurants in Singapore, but at the end of the day, we always come back to this one ! Mid-low price range, air-conditioned, no queue (if you can be there earlier or make reservation for bigger group, we always visit there on Sunday 9.30am - NO QUEUE)We love it because the food is good and the ambience is very Oriental. They serve dim sum on different push-carts during the weekend. A casual eateries located in the middle of ChinaTown. If you are visiting China Town this is one of the must-go (we always bring our visitors here and they loved it). 2 Person spent around $30 for dim sum brunch. (not bad)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Normal Dimsum,30,06-23-16,"i'm a big fan of Dimsum, but the portion here is small and expensive. Taste average and not worth the money.Not to be picky, but it takes long time for the food to be served.only ate a little bit and the bill was close to SGD 100average is about 4.20 per dim sum with 3 little small pieces of food.don't think will come here againsorry"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,VERY thirsty after eating here,30,06-21-16,"I do not want to make accusations of what ingredients were put in here, but after my tim sum tea break here with my friends, we ALL felt extremely thirsty an hour later. We all suspect that more than just salt was added to make the food all so tasty (and indeed the food was very good). But tasty food should not be due to adding (that particular ingredient) and I am most disappointed. I aint coming back here ANYMORE."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious and lots of choices,40,06-19-16,"Craving yum cha, my hotel pointed me to this restaurant.
I was alone but starving!
I had 5 different types of yum cha and they were all great.
Definitely worth a visit in Chinatown ?? !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum,30,06-17-16,"Ok,it's basically cantina,no place for business lunch or romantic dinnerVisited for the first time,had dim sums only but they are really ok,and the price is really cheap,what else?Reed some reviews regarding staff and design,frankly-don't careFour off us overeating for the total price off 100 singapore dollars?With good sums,come on.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible Experience,10,06-06-16,I received a confirmation email from Chope only to go to the restaurant on the day itself to find out that they never received the booking. It was a friend's birthday and there were 10 of us and of course the restaurant was not able to accommodate us. Had to scramble to find another place to go to. Better to call the restaurant directly instead of going through Chope.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Food is nice, service is lousy!!!",30,06-04-16,The food is nice with lots of variety but the waitress service is really bad. Placing order with smile to them and even by saying thank you but return you are all black face attitude.. Seem that they doesn't welcome you there to eat at all ... Haha
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Mostly consistent food quality, haughty Manager",30,06-02-16,"For authentic tasting dim sum but served in relatively larger portions, Yum Cha is the place to go. However, our favourite egg tart has suffered a huge drop in standard. It's been served cold and lacks the usual soft fluffy texture and aroma. Otherwise, other usual suspects like siew mai (steamed pork dumplings), har kao (prawn dumpling) and rice dumplings still taste good. Service, however can be improved. Serving crew was obviously overwhelmed but they tried their best to be hospitable. The same cannot be said of the young male manager, however. He was haughty and waved customers away to ask them to wait when he was busy. As a local, guess I am used to this but this may not be entirely pleasant for a tourist curious about local delicacies and can do with some patient serving staff who can explain the wonderful flavours that Yum Cha can offer. In short, go purely for its food and expect nothing from their service. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Thesangas,40,05-26-16,"This our forth time we have eaten at this restaurant, it didn't disappoint . This authentic dim sum is the best in Chinatown we were the only non chinese in the restaurant which says a lot about the food . Great value for money."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Mini holiday,40,05-19-16,"We ate at yum Cha as part of out Chinatown tour, there was quite a variety of food to try from the set menu. We did not leave hungry !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Another place for fin shark...,20,05-14-16,"The place is like a factory, so busy.Staff have no time to give any attention as they are running all over the place. Very busy.Dim sum are great, tasty but unfortunately one more place that don't give sh... about the shark fin awful trade and offer shark fin dim sum on their menu.Not recommended at all."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic Chinese fare,40,05-12-16,This yum cha (dim sum) place is the best and most authentic I have been to in Singapore. While we were there there was only 1 other non Chinese in the restaurant which I think says a lot about the food because the Chinese really love to eat. My friend and I shared 9 dishes and 2 pots of tea for a total of S $69.Great value
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great yum cha...but...,40,05-10-16,"This place is excellent - lots of choices, little servings of everything so you can try as much as possible, cheap(ish) for Singapore and quality, efficient service. The only disappointing thing was that you had to have shark fin Xiao Long Bao. I love this dish but don't like contributing to the practice of killing off the world's sharks. Get the dumplings in chili oil and the pork buns. Bon appetit! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy Yum Cha,40,04-24-16,"This Ym Cha Restaurant is located on the first floor in Chinatown (20 Trengganu Street), and it is somewhat difficult to find. There are two entrances - one from the five-foot way hidden by souvenir stalls while the other from the entrance of Jinshan Hotel. From the former, ascend a flight of steps and from the latter, an escalation. The food is quite tasty and price reasonable. The service is efficient. If you are a first timer, you will probably be hungry and sweaty by the time you find this restaurant that straddles 3 shop lots on the second floor."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food and service,40,04-23-16,Same names for all the dim sum dishes I have eaten all over the world. Here the dishes are not as oily. Some of the same name dishes made a little different but all great. Place does need a major update and lift needs to be fixed.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing dim sum,20,03-31-16,Popped in here for a quick casual dim sum dinner and left disappointed. The prawn with mango was the the highlight. Friendly staff but significantly inferior to both Spring Court and Yann Palace. Will not return
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dimsum,40,03-17-16,The Dimsum was really good and the price is affordable. The steam fish maw in shrimp paste is good. The restaurant area was quite big.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Quite original, Tasty Dimsum",40,03-16-16,"Every time i come and stay around Chinatown area in Singapore, i always like to visit and eat Dimsum in this restaurant. Located just very near to Chinatown MRT, it is easy to find. The dimsum selection is quite original and most of them are good and tasty. The price is also still quite reasonable.So every time when i'm craving for some dimsum in Singapore, this restaurant will come in mind and so far it has not disappoint my taste bud. Recommended!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good try for foreigners,30,03-11-16,Worth a try for tourists. Good solid Dim sum with acceptable service. Nice setting and good variety. I enjoyed myself but food is quite heavy.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum,40,03-01-16,"Lava Bun is the best. Dim Sum is great and resonable price. Restaurant is easy to find. If you are in that area, give it a try!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,mmm mmm mmm mmm,40,02-21-16,"Yum Cha has become my favourite dim sum restaurant in Singapore - buzzy atmosphere, Malacca style tables, trolley service, great dumplings and grumpy staff in the middle of Chinatown. Perfect ! You can also visit the nearby temple if heading this way. The dumpling pastry is excellent and the range of fillings pretty good - the one downside from this diver's view point is that the restaurant still offers a couple of dishes with shark's fin. Ho, hum. Is everything good ? No, I was disappointed by the cheung fun and the lotus leaf wrapped rice got the thumbs down as well. You may have to wait for a table at peak times but the turnover is quick and the queue orderly. Note that there are three ways of getting to Yum Cha, which is on the first (second in Singapore) floor, if you are laden or have a push chair - the stairs, and round the corner either an escalator or a lift. The well chilled beer is by the glass or by the pitcher, and tea is a good, non-alcoholic alternative. When you are starving and the trolleys arrive too slowly you can always ask one of the staff for the plates that you want and, if the sauce is a little for your taste just request some chopped chilli in soya. The greens of the day are fresh and cooked to order. Oh, and the price is very reasonable - maybe half that of London's Chinatown."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious dim sum,40,02-06-16,"Very crowded dim sum restaurant where they bring the food around with carts for you to choose your selections. You can also request things directly from the servers. Besides your traditional dim sum choices, they also have Singaporean Carrot Cake. (For those not in the know, this is not a dessert, nor does it contain carrots, that I could tell). Get a seat by the window to watch the hustle & bustle of Chinatown go by as you stuff yourself silly. Service was on the slower side, but allowed us time to enjoy a relaxed brunch."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Yum Cha,40,02-06-16,"Hidden away in China town this little treasure has great food, quick service. The venue ambiance is cheap but so is the bill. You won't need a mortgage to eat here and the food is great. Go and enjoy"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim sum, so-so service",30,02-03-16,"The long queue to get in - including many locals, or at least apparently ethnic Chinese people - suggested good things ahead.When we got to our table, tea and Tiger arrived promptly. We ordered in part off the menu and in part from the trolleys. The steamed offerings were good, the fried were a little bland and boring. The wok-fried spinach (with ginger and garlic) was outstanding.Service was, at its best, patchy. Staff seemed run off their feet, and although we were given menus, it took a long time to flag down someone who could take our order. Likewise, the trolley circuit was erratic, and we had to wait for long periods to get attention (and food).The location in Chinatown is great, and the place itself has a pleasing atmosphere.There are better dim sum elsewhere, but Yum Cha is an institution."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,old fashion dim sum with push carts,50,01-31-16,Was delighted to find that this dimsum restaurant has pushcarts. Rather than ordering from a menu you get to order the old fashioned way from old women pushing the carts of hot dimsum around. This plae looks like a blast from the past -- like the dimsum restaurants I remember when I was a child
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Some tasty dimsum, average not great",30,01-26-16,"THE GOOD:Some interesting dim sumCheapTHE NOT SO GOOD:Toilets are disgustingCheung fun blandWe ate here for lunch and the food was okay, nothing special I thought. You need to be aware that if you don't eat peanuts or use the wet towels they will charge you for it.The squid ink dim sum was tasty and was our favourite. Although the cheung fun was very bland and only had two prawns in them. Service was okay, my biggest gripe was the state of the toilets. They were absolutely disgusting. The staff or patrons obviously use it for smoking but not only that, the toilet seat was smeared with brown all over it. Really ruined our visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum sensation ,50,01-16-16,"Authentic Dim sum restaurant with waitresses pushing the dim sum trolley, you would feel the same in Hong Kong. Crowded even during lunch which shows how popular and affordable it is.
Strongly recommended!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Brunch spot - cantonese style,50,01-14-16,"I enjoyed every visit I had to Yum Cha restaurant. The Dim Sum dishes are not oily nor too salty. I recommend all their steamed dishes and also the custard buns. The Chinese tea served is of good quality too. We spent SGD68 (including service charge and GST) on 12 dishes, a pot of tea and the peanuts/papertowel. The place is very noisy though it seems to bring you back in time to the old days of Singapore, or feels like in Macau dimsum cafes."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as good as it used to be,30,01-12-16,"It was our second visit, The dim sums were mediocre, nothing special. I remembered they used to be better especially the egg tarts. It is conveniently open all day for dim sums though."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food in Chinatown,40,01-03-16,Great spot for dining in Chinatown. The mango prawn is a must I reckon. Not particularly cozy though.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Authentic, wonderful food - perfunctory service",40,12-26-15,"A really great meal in a nice environment, but the service is strange ... we ordered soup, dim sum, main courses, rice and vegetables and every dish was delivered together, all at once within five minutes ... when we asked if they could keep the food hot so we could eat the soup first, we were not accommodated ... when we finished, no one asked if we wanted dessert or if we wanted a check ... we just sat and sat and sat until the entire restaurant cleared and still no one came to the table ... the staff just proceeded cleaning up and ignored us ... it was a wonderful meal but a bizarre experience ... it was not until we asked that we were told to go to the cashier ... "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good Food, But They Nickle and Dime You",30,12-18-15,"I read something from the Guardian about this place being good so I stopped by here on my trip to Singapore for some dim sum.The food was good, above average even. The Shu Mai were succulent. The bean curd was delicious. I would be giving this place four stars except when I got the bill I noticed they charged me $2 for eating a couple of the little peanuts they put out on the table. They also charged me sixty cents to use the moist towelette on the table. Now maybe this is a cultural thing, but usually if a restaurant puts something out on the table without you asking for it it is a courtesy and you are not charged for it. I was charged nearly as much for a couple of peanuts I thought were free as I was for a dim sum item. This practice feels dishonest and I would recommend the management at Yum Cha discontinues it immediately.I would recommend this place, with the caveat that you shouldn't eat the peanuts and bring your own towelette!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Love it!!,40,11-29-15,"The mango prawn fritters, all sorts of porridge, and scallop dumplings are amazing (along with all the other options.. wasn't disappointed with anything) !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Group dining,40,11-19-15,"We were having a group dinner with a friend who just came back from overseas. Friend was craving dim sum so badly. Food and service was really good. However, Yum Cha serves only limited selection of dim sum for dinner. Would be good if there are more dim sum options for dinner."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of our favourite places to eat when visiting Singapore,50,11-12-15,"Busy, friendly environment to eat, with a variety of delicious dishes. The staff are friendly and attentive. Dim sum are excellent"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable good food with nice ambiance in Chinatown,50,11-12-15,"We enjoyed the food. They are tasty and above average. Reasonable price too. Good location right in the heart of Chinatown. A little challenging to locate the entrance though.I booked using Chope and it was a breeze. I received confirmation via email almost instantly despite it was late at night and the night before a public holiday. However, the staff at Yum Cha told me that they do not accept booking on public holidays. I was adviced to feedback to Chope. The queue was long at the restaurant and no way I could let my guests wait in the queue. Thankfully the staff was nice to honour the booking. She got one table for us after 10 mins which I was very thankful. I hope Chope can sort out the booking policies with the participating restaurants to prevent such incidents."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Acceptable Dim Sum,30,11-10-15,"Visited the outlet near Expo for lunch today. Quite a busy place, but efficient. We had 6 different servings of dim sum and tea for a price of about $35, which seemed like reasonable value. All tasted pretty good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dim Sumg lunch ever,50,11-08-15,If you want to have an excellent dim sum meal this is your restaurant. Plan to take your time it truly is an authentic Chinese restaurant we enjoyed over 18 different varieties of food all very good
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but decent enough",40,10-17-15,"Preference for dim sum in Singapore is Red Star, but we couldn't get a booking, so opted for this place insteadWe also had my relatives in from Hong Kong and so finding a decent dim sum was essentialThe restaurant itself is nothing to write home about, but nevertheless, still very popular - especially with passing tourists wandering through ChinatownWe were a table of 11 and so lots of dishes were being ordered and when the aunties with their dim sum trollies caught on that it was a table of Hong Kongers, they scrambled to show off their dishes, hoping they diners would be impressedThe char siu buns went down well, but my relatives found the portions to be extremely small for the priceHowever, we all left satisfied enough"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yumcha@chinatown,50,10-17-15,"Gd dim sum, value for $ buffet dimsum. Have to ask the staffs to change your table to a cooler location if u r afraid of sweating while enjoying your hot food ?"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,excellent dim sum in a traditional setting,50,10-16-15,"this long time restaurant on the second floor in Chinatown has terrific dim sum with many options and great tasting dim sum.we went around 3 pm (just as the dim sum all you can eat for high tea was starting) but ordered fewer items off the menu. The choices were varied, tasty, not oily and fun!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,it's great place to have dimsum!,40,10-06-15,"it stays in 2nd floor of the building on Temple St., China Town. Opening time is from 09:00 am.it's great place for gathering family. their dim sum is delicious, great & deserved with its price.they will not give you any menu, each staff that takes care for some dishes with trolley; will come to your table and asks whether you would like to have dishes -> such a nice experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Stick to Din Tai Fung,30,10-04-15,"When I googled yum cha, this place kept coming up and the reviews were really good. Well I was really shocked that it would be so popular! We queued for a while and even though the restaurant wasn't full, it took a while for someone to take us to a table. We asked for the peanuts to be taken away as didn't want to be charged for something we didn't want. After all, we wanted to save room for delicious dim sum! Well what a disappointment, in a nutshell, they weren't super hot, the dumplings were bland and tasteless and I have had far better in other countries! The restaurant is also really noisy due to the wooden flooring, and we will never return. Din Tai Fung is far cleaner, better service and their dumplings are far more delicious!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum,50,10-03-15,"Probably the best dim sum in my admittedly limited experience. I like that its a little hidden, up some stairs and around a corner (though not hard to find), making it feel like a respite from the busy touristy street below. There was a healthy mix of tourists and locals, and no question as to the authenticity. Prices are very reasonable. Service is a little business-like, but not unfriendly and frankly that seems the norm at dim sum places. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch with Dim Sum at Yum Cha,50,10-03-15,"Head upstairs in the heart of Chinatown to probably the best Dim Sum house in Singapore. Full of character and served with traditional trolleys. The food is delicious and varied with a few items that you might not have seen elsewhere - such as the squid ink dumplings. The yam dumplings, Cheung Fun and Char Sui Bau are traditional favourites. It is hard to go wrong."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Beautiful taste ,40,09-29-15,Dim Sum is the best in Chinatown comparing with other famous restaurant. Price is not that expensive. Better try this shop!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good spread of Chinese Dim Sum,30,09-10-15,"If you'd like a taste of Chinese Dim Sum, try out Yum Cha in Chinatown when you do visit there. You get a good spread of Dim Sum spread on push carts. The quality isn't the best, but it's a good sample spread taste test."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Perennial,40,09-10-15,"I first came here 10+ years ago when the place still had ceiling fans, now replaced by air conditioning, but no matter when or what, the food has maintained consistency. I have been several times now, but I have only just reviewed it.Dim sum dishes are plentiful. We also ordered a fish and on occasion I have watched my friends order chilli crab. The food service is very fast - he kitchen must be efficient.It is the sort of place that the locals go to, so give it a try. I am sure you will like the place."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum restaurant,50,09-09-15,"A friend of mine had recommended this restaurant as a good lunchtime venue and he was certainly correct. It is on a corner location and two stories up via escalator. Not too busy when we arrived about 12.30pm. Huge choice of dishes on menu. You just mark on the menu how many portions of each dish you require and the waiter then collects. All the dishes were freshly cooked and served without delay. Great value for money, for a change, in this rather expensive city."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as bad as people say,40,09-09-15,This is like a classic old school dim sum restaurant. Yes if they give u clean wipes and pickles/ nuts they will charge u for them but this is quite normal. The Ha Kow was very good. The chicken Wings in a bag were too oily for me. The cheung fan with prawns was average but not bad. Overall I give this place a 4 and was glad I tried it
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food haven,40,09-06-15,Authentic Cuisine at affordable prices. very good ventilation. with so many choices from ducks to pork to chili crabs.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Classic style Chinese tea room,40,09-05-15,Dumplings etc were good and service was very attentive. We were there with our 9-month old twins and the staff were fantastic with them.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old dim sum restaurant in chinatown,40,09-01-15,"This restaurant is located on the second floor in chinatown area. The restaurant is spaces and bright. Usually crowded during lunch time. Very traditionally decorated to give you a feel of the old times. The food is considered reasonably priced compared to restaurants in the prime area like orchard road. Food is good. I ordered steam ""char siu"" rice rolls, fried glutinous rice, steam char siu bun, deep fried yam, fried silver fish etc."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for dim sum ,50,08-28-15,Visited hear for dim sum while shopping after being highly recommended and it surely never disappointed. Even though we arrived close to closing time the food quality was great and the service was good also. Priced decently and surely not too expensive. If your around the area I would definitely recommend this place. A must visit! #amit1chahal
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Sunday Yum Cha,40,08-25-15,Our visiting Australian is crazy on Yum Chas but only likes the ones that has trolley service. Yum Cha Restaurant in China town is one such place that offers a trolley service but only on weekends. we got there about `215 in the afternoon and the wait was about 15 mins. once we got a table the trolleys were there and it seemed as though they were in a hurry to get you out as soon as possible. all up the quality of the Yum Cha was good and there were a few items not seen on the traditional Yum cha menu. all up very good and $15 corkage fee for a bottle of wine was not to bad. will go again.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good morning with Dim sum ,40,08-24-15,"We visit Yum cha reataurant at Chinatown, It's on second floor, a big place with many tables. Many custom are a long queue, should be booking before. Dim sum food has excellent menu, many kind of stream food, fried food and dessert with egg tart."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Visitor,50,08-21-15,"Average food and reasonably priced Place a bit drabby, could do with some refurbishment and upgrade of the whole area."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum heaven,50,08-19-15,"Yum Cha serves a variety of dim sum. Trolleys roll by frequently for you to make a choice. Or you can place an order. Service is quick. There are always queues, but it moves quickly. If you are trying dim sum for the first time, read up a bit on it so you know what you are ordering. We go often, never been disappointed. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Poor service, below average food",20,08-12-15,"We found that place because of the ""Singapore Restaurant Month"", where they were supposed to have a special dish, celebrating Singapore's 50 years of independence. Upon arriving, we stood there, waiting to be seated, as it is usual around the city. At least half a dozen waitresses passed us by and none of them even care to address us or even nod. Since the restaurant was not so full, we decided to get a table on our own. Little we know, the bad service was just starting to show.The special dish was in a separate menu over the table, so we decided to order it. The waiter simply told us that we could only order it after 6PM, even though there was absolutely no such information on the website or even at the menu. We then decide to move to the dim sums, as they are supposed to be the house specialty. Granted, some of them were good, but most of them were too greasy, even those that were supposed to be stir fried.The place itself it's also not very clean (on our way out we noticed it received a 'B' grade from hygiene inspectors, which is below many food stalls).Bottom line, if you want a good dim sum around town, you'll be better off with Dim Tai Fung. It's more expensive, but it's also on a completely different level."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very good dim sum! ,40,08-10-15,"This restaurant specialises in dim sum. We were advised to come to this place by family. We were told to expect to wait for table as it's always busy, we awaited approx 10 minutes for a table of 8. The way it works is each table has a list of all the food and drinks available and the food is cooked to go, some ladies bring the food round as it's cooked and you have to tell them what you want off the trolley and they write down how many you've hadn't the card, at the end of the meal you take the card to the till and pa for what you have eaten. You have to be patient because the trolley goes around the whole restaurant. You can order specific foods that aren't on trolleys and the waiter will order it to be cooked (again please be patient) it's not a quick service but the food is absolutely amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Rip off- watch the add ons!,",20,08-03-15,"Be careful when you dine here. What we thought was a small dish of complimentary peanuts,($2.00!!), and hand wipes, (60cents each),were added to our bill! And a teapot of tea was $3.60!!!Dishes were cheap $2.50-$4.80, but service was terrible. We were given a menu, pencil and ordering sheet to fill out. Food tasted stale. No sign of authentic dishes, eg chicken feet or beef tripe, or porridge, or veggies. Still looking for authentic yum Cha in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum ,40,07-29-15,"We liked the food! Prices were reasonable, service friendly. Good place to go when looking for dim sum. If you want to get a table for sure, make a reservation!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum is good,40,07-26-15,"The decor is nothing special and I've seen greater variety of Dim Sum selection, however the six Dim Sum dishes we ordered were very fresh and tasty, the price was okay - not too cheap (about 5 SGD per steam basket) but fine for what we got for the money. Staff seemed busy even though the restaurant was only half full, but were helpful when we needed anything."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,average dining experience,40,07-25-15,"staff were very busy and had no time to attend to us.
the aircon was not strong enough, especially for a hot and humid afternoon."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible food and shocking service ,10,07-24-15,"We decided we'd like an air conditioned seafood restaurant for my infants comfort and to enjoy a night out with my hubby and the in laws... Upon arrival you are directed to the table, no smiles.. Sit and be prepared to be yelled at. Staff are extremely rude, but they do attend to the table... The way they express them themselves is rather aggressive... Anyway...We ordered a few of their signature dishes... Peking duck is a waste of money, duck was dry, pancakes tiny! Waste of stomach space. We ordered a beef dish, ohhhhhh that was the toughest and piece of meat ever. The other thing that disturbs me whilst try to eat my meal is the constant staring by all staff members .Awkward night out, in terms of food, I would never recommend this to anyone I know. It's not cheap either."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Horrible service by captain.,10,07-21-15,"Came for dimsum but was shocked with waitress foul attitude. Her tone of voice was haughty as though there's no other restaurants we could go for dimsums. We could anytime go to Yan Ting, Peach Blossom, Summer Palace, Asia Grand, Royal China or Spring Court & be welcomed witb open arms & hearty smiles. Even the captain Simon couldnt care less whenever we gave feedbacks to him, he is too aloof as though he was indispensable. Silver Fish had deteriorated a lot over the years, soggy with oil. The skin of Har Kao is thicker than before & hard. Siu Mai had so much fatty pork. Worst of all was the century egg porridge which had only one tiny wee 5mm bit size of century egg & the rest was plain congee. Seriously, this is daylight robbery. Service was lousy & food was terrible yet management was never bothered with customers' constructive feedbacks. Only one chinese female waitress did a great job as she was pleasant, efficient, caring & helpful to our needs. After supporting Yum Cha Gardens since it first opened in Serangoon Gardens, it kicked off with fanfare for 3 years then continually deteriorating till today. Would i recommend, ""no way"" bcos i dont want to lose my reputation for such lousy food & lousy service."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"A bit hard to find, but worth it!",40,07-21-15,"We really wanted dumplings, this was recommended by the hotel. It had an address of Trengganu street in Chinatown, but it is actually around the corner on Smith street, upstairs. Great food, attentive service, OMG the garlic on the garlic prawns.....there was a lot. Lovely dumplings!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Yum Cha,40,07-08-15,"If you want good Yum Cha without the tourist trimmings - this is for you. Set up a long flight of stairs, hidden amongst China Town shops - well worth the fine. You will get a good feed here of quality local food without the grandeur.Basic seating, restaurant has no view but is cool. Service is ok - but the food is why you are here and it delivers.Would definitely be back."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful,50,07-04-15,"One of the best Yum Cha's i have had, great food and service. Well priced and good variety of dishes. really easy and fresh."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dimsum Restaurant in Singapore,50,06-30-15,"Yum Cha is located in China Town Singapore, which is the place is less noticeable. But they served the best dim sum I ever taste. The LoMaKay (sticky rice with pork meat and salted egg, wrapped with lotus leaf) is the best ever. The Shu May also good. They also served the various soup menu and also porridgeLittle bit pricey, but totally worthed."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is delicious but the price is a little bit expensive,40,06-28-15,"One of the most delicious dim sun restaurant in Singapore. But you must be careful about the price which does not include 10% service charge, 7% government tax, towel and peanuts on the table."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food not fresh,20,06-25-15,"service poor attitude whereas food were not that fresh
ordering was a long awaiting process
prices were not reasonable"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum,40,06-20-15,"Recommended to me by a taxi driver. The restaurant can be difficult to find- the sign is a teapot and upstairs.
Only had the dim sum which was good and hot, service fairly average and prices OK"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum,40,06-19-15,This restaurant was a little hard to find. We passed the entrance and had to back track to find it. . . maybe it's just us. We were there before 11:00 and the place was packed. Really enjoyed the dim sum that they brought around with the carts. I can't speak Chinese but the ladies were nice enough to show me all the different dishes she was carrying. I like to eat my dim sum with some soy sauce but there isn't any on the table. Just ask the server and they will give you a small dish. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,poor food except peking duck,20,05-31-15,"We went there for dinner and all the food we had was pretty poor, especially the dim sum and the flat rice pancakes, which were impossible to eat. We ordered some glazed beef and the taste wasn't bad but quite tough. The Peking duck was good, though pancakes had a different taste from others I've tried elsewhere. Service was quite annoying because the waiters kept coming every 2 seconds to pour more tea, even if we'd only taken a sip."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Breakfast at Changi City Point outlet,30,05-18-15,Food was served quite fast. Whole restaurant is not that big and currently there is 10% discount for NTUC member for weekend. I would not say that the food is that fantastic. Those fried items were very oily and fried carrot cake is the best. One of the unique item is the squid ink dumpling which is worth trying.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Non existent service and terrible food,10,05-17-15,"Do not bother to come here. Drives you crazy.
The food is not fresh. There is no one that speaks English well. Frustrating. If you sit further in the restaurant, the food trolley never comes to you."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Food,50,04-30-15,"Found the restaurant when in China town,my friend ordered and what a fabulous Dim Sum lunch we had. Was introduced to some really different food.The menu was large ,food was hot in temperature ,good service,friendly and typical Chinese atmosphere,thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Restaurant was busy with Chinese and Europeans.What a treat and will definitely go back on my next visit.The Singapore noodles were wonderful which is one of my favourites and a huge portion.It certainly was worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great tour stop,40,04-30-15,"We took the Singapore Chinatown By Night tour and one of the stops was for a meal at ""Yum Cha"". What a brilliant, yet simple, meal. There were 12 on the tour and we were seated at two tables with 6 on each. We love Chinese food and it was really good in a way that everyone could enjoy. The way the locals were tucking in to their food showed that they were enjoying their experience too. It looked like it would be a great place to eat at any time. The only problem was that we were kept waiting, on of the party spent too much time in the markets!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,20,04-19-15,"This restaurant had been recommended , but unfortunately we were not impressed. The restaurant lacked atmosphere and the food, admittedly not dim sum was only average at best. We had looked forward to a meal in Chinatown, but left unimpressed. We also felt that the food was over priced."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Quality Dim Sum,40,04-14-15,Really decent quality dim sum without the usual surly waitress service. Nice to be able to watch through a window into a prep area where they make the dumplings etc. High quality but pricey with it and a bit put off by the coach parties of well-heeled tourists. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Freshly prepared and tasty Dim Sum with an efficient service, but quite pricey",50,03-28-15,"We had lunch at Yum Cha and tried a variety of dishes. Without exception the dishes came to the table hot, freshly prepared and were tasty.The service was efficient and empty dishes were cleared from our table promptly.One of the best Dim Sum i have had anywhere in the world, but overall quite expensive."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service,20,03-14-15,"The staff who served us were unequivocally non-chalent about taking orders. They were only interested in quickly unloading those already cooked and being put on trolleys. They were rude at best.Some of the dim sum was good, but some were tasteless. The fried dishes were cold. I rather spend less at restaurants like crystal jade/ding tai feng and get better food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Loved it!,40,03-10-15,"We were in Singapore for a brief stopover, and had found details in guidebook. It was a little had to find, given all the stalls in Trengganu street. We were not sure we had the right place but several businessmen and other locals went past us in rapid succession, obviously intent on a quick lunch. We were seated quickly, in a sparsely decorated restaurant. The waitress was a little gruff, but attentive nonetheless and she warmed up over our lunch. Although she had little English, she pointed out an additional dish we may not have tried, the bean curd and shrimp dumplings. We ordered from the menu, and ordered a variety of dishes, including BBQ pork bun, chilled baby octopus in sesame, crispy wonton, steamed pork in garlic and chilli, prawn and wood ear fungus dumplings, and our favourite, mango prawn fritters with sesame. She also understood when we ordered just one small plate of fried carrot cake (3 pieces) between 6 of us, and offered to cut it in smaller portions so we could all satisfy our curiosity. We reordered three dishes because they were so good, but then we were struggling to finish it off. The almond tea was lovely, but some of our party ordered beer. We agreed it was the best yum cha we had eaten in 20 years. The bill came to around $30 singapore per head, but understand we ate a lot! Happy to recommend, but you really don't need to try the fried carrot cake. Everything else was excellent. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sums with some great varieties,40,03-10-15,Excellent dim sums with some good varieties - particularly for someone like me visiting from the UK. Be prepared to wait in a queue on the weekends but it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. Essentially the restaurant serves dim sums on a trolley and one just picks their selection. Had some different varieties like squid ink dim sums which were delicious! The pastry around the dim sums was thin and well made.Service was no different than any other average Chinese restaurant.All in all worth a visit on the weekends...
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha Is A Singapore Star,40,03-10-15,"@TheKuoKnowsYum Cha is not the easiest restaurant to find. But do persevere. It is really worth the bother, especially if you enjoy stepping back in time into a piece of old Singapore as much as I do.Yum Cha does away with many of the frills that other dim-sum eateries spend inordinate amounts of money on. So, don't expect plush decor and comfy seats. It is functional rather than fancy.The service is pared back to the bare minimum too. But that's ok. It's the food that counts. And the food is wholesomely good.The Char Siu Baos are some of the best I have had - big and fluffy and full of fillings. The Har Gau are generously size and the Cheung Fun are thin and delicate.Do leave some room at the end of the meal for a sumptious egg tart - that is if you can stop at just one. I couldn't."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit disappointed,30,03-01-15,"My husband and I visited with my brother-in-law and his partner just before Chinese New Year. We had the Hi Tea Buffet.The staff were attentive (but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant anyway). The food was pretty average. I have definitely had better dim sum in other restaurants/countries I have visited and unless you eat absolutely masses the buffet is not brilliant value for money. If you visit you will need to make a decision based on how many big eaters are in your party.I am not a big fish eater. We asked if there was any fish in the steamed carrot cake with cai poh and were told no. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted and I'm guessing from the taste that cai poh is a fish!It was an experience and we enjoyed some of the dishes - particularly the fried chicken in Thai sauce, baked mini egg tarts and chilled mango pudding!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch,10,03-01-15,"We had lunch at Yum Cha today and every waitress treated us so rudely! Pouring the tea spilling it everywhere, grabbing the plates before we were finished eating - unacceptably rude behaviour when we brought an out of town guest with us. We will never return!! Your food is not that great to put up with this insulting behaviour !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth the hype,30,02-26-15,"Visited Jan 2015 during our Chinatown Night Tour. We had a fixed dinner, starting with herbal rose tea, which was nothing more than rose scented hot water in a kettle. The other items in our dinner menu was ok. Though it was included in our Chinatown tour, the quality and quantity was not fulfilling. But we had a good tour team and we enjoyed our time throughout the tour and this place gave us a chance to sit and talk with each other. The restaurant was somewhat crowded with lots of locals and tourists and it was surely understaffed. Our server picked up our dishes couple of times before we even finish our food, which was not good. Didn't had a chance to order other items from the menu as it was a fixed meal. Lots of other eateries in Chinatown, so this can be skipped unless you're in a tour which includes dinner here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown Gem,40,02-18-15,"For those who are unsure about eating off the hawker street stalls, Yum Cha is a gem in the middle of Chinatown. We tried the afternoon Dimsum Buffet and left completely satisfied. The staff were polite and helpful as we explored the unfamiliar menu and ordering routine. Going in a group of four meant that we were able to sample a broad range of what was on offer with no left overs - note that the restaurant has an excellent policy for the buffet of charging for wasteage. The key to the buffet is to order little and often to make sure that your eyes don't exceed you stomach! The dimsum arrived freshly prepared and with little delay. We would advise others to arrive earlier in the afternoon - we came at 16.30 which left us a little tight for the 17.30 ordering curfew - and take your time to enjoy the buffet to its full extent. Do leave enough space for the excellent deserts we especially enjoyed the custard tarts and mango pudding though the almond tea was a pleasant surprise. For non fish eaters - avoid the steamed white carrot cake - it's VERY fishy. The lavender and coconut steamed balls would also be better saved for desert. If you are not hearty eaters then consider ordering a la carte as the reasonable prices may be better value than the buffet. We found the restaurant to be well signposted despite the extra street activity of Chinese new year - signage was clear if you looked up while walking along!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dimsum Heaven,50,02-15-15,"I travel for Dimsum and have loved other dimsum such as the one in NYC China Town and SF's China Town. I can compare their siomai (pork and shrimp) texture, flavor to both. Its so good we order quite a bit of it. You can't go wrong. Eat with your eyes and then try everything!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Different but good,40,02-08-15,"This restaurant was very popular the staff were attentive and service was quick. Recommend the BBQ Pork Bun, Shark's Fin with Meat Dumpling. The Prawn & Mango sesame Fritters were different but nice.BBQ Pork Flour Roll again never had them before but OK. Shredded Chicken Congee were very good and for desert we had Crispy Red Bean with Banana were also very nice. Would recommend this restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to take your visitors.,40,02-05-15,"it is in china town, a bit diffiult to find the entrance, specially during Chines New Year with so many stalls. but it is good place for dimsums . They still go around the restaurant with trolleys showing off the food. So jut pick inside the bamboo box and choose what you fancy most. very reasonable priced, Quality is fine but not the fine dinning level.No reservation on saturday or sunday. Just send an advance person to start the queue. Nice place for a family gathering or with friends."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Skip it,20,01-26-15,"Overall this one deserves sad applause, winning no category of service, quality. Cost, taste or ambience. The place is hidden in Chinatown and gives somewhat of an impression that you might find a gem located in the hustle of it all. So up a narrow staircase and excitement brews but alas a big hall, no music and bold bright light. We enter and get pointed to a table fairly promptly and were thinking ""the food should be good since there are a lot of review of the place that speaks to it"". So we rush to call for menus and order too much so we can give a whole bunch of things a try.First comes the vegetables. Vegetarian they say and sprinkled with the usual dose of unnecessary shrimp. Next the fried rice then dumplings etc. dish after dish waiting for something to write home to. Unfortunate I can't say a single one. The service was fairly prompt but never with a smile. The price...hefty for Chinatown. I would carefully reconsider if you want to go here. It's simply not worth it and there are far far better options in Chinatown. Skip it and save yourself the attempt to prove me wrong. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese High Tea,50,01-25-15,"If you are looking for a dim sum type experience and you look at the time and think "" missed it"", do not despair. Yum Cha has their version of a high tea dim sum (no carts, just a menu with pics) from 3-6pm, but you must arrive by 5 or they will tell you its last order before you order anything! All the food is delicious, shrimp and mango rolls, paper chicken wings, custard buns, you name it and it is made to perfection.As is the case in many Chinatown eateries , the service can be gruff and dismissive but for me that's all part of the charm.You will find this place upstairs, try to get a table by the window and watch the Chinatown chaos go on below you while you enjoy perfectly cooked food and deliciously hot Jasmine tea."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great variety of Dim Sum,40,01-17-15,"We didn't have to wait for too long to be seated. They gave us Chinese menu and never came back for the order. We didn't know the waitors would come with dim sum trolley. We just had to point and speak. But our table was in the corner where the waitors didn't seem to notice we were there. A bit unorganized service, ortherwise, great variety of delicious food!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Place for Brunch (dim sum)!,40,01-09-15,Long queue but worth it. Good place with great taste for dim sum. Fast service/serving. Will be back again when visit SG.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Typical Singapore,50,01-09-15,"very traditional and typical Singaporean Dim sum, cozy atmosphere,traditional ambience, amazing and very helpful staff.Cook very well presented and cooked to perfection,Located right in the middle of Chinatown on a second floor corner.The place is a little difficult to find because of all the little stores lining up the alleyway, once you find it and go up the stairs the place opens up to a pretty nice dining room, very cozy and warm.Will definitely visit again on my next trip."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Singaporean Dim Sum,40,01-07-15,"You get a very comfortable dining experience with the no-frills dim sum spread against a very cozy ambiance, notably the marble tables and classic wooden seats i.e. very typical Singaporean style. I like their har gows and siew mais, which is consistently tasty and good. Their porridge is also worth mentioning cooked to the right texture. As for dessert, make sure you try their banana pancake."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Traditional Dim sum restaurant. Worth a visit,40,01-03-15,When in Chinatown this is a great option for Dim Sum. Whilst it is in the heart of Chinatown it is a little hard to find the first time as its on the first floor and the entrance is not particularly well signposted. We thoroughly enjoyed Yum Cha and visited it several times when in Singapore. Staff are friendly and the food was delicious. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Vignette of history!,40,12-29-14,"Good to be back after many years and see things are still mostly the same. The dim sum still being carted along the aisles which has disappeared from so many restaurants in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hongkong as was commonplace before. The quality is good to very good.I especially enjoyed the chicken wings in paper bag, steamed sticky riceParcels, and the hargao dumplings. Good, fast service and very reasonable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very reliable dim sum in the heart of Chinatown,40,12-27-14,"VIsited Yum Cha numerous times and think they deserve a good review after my visit this afternoonLocation - easily accessible via train/bus as it is in the heart of Chinatown. its on 2nd floor of the hotelFood - tried both dim sum in the morning/noon as well as Chinese dinner in the evening. Good quality, and fresh. Most important - food is served piping hot. If you are on dim sum go int he morning/noon as the selection of dim sum is less on dinner session. typical fare like char siew bao, prawn dumpling, siew mai are very good.Service - very good - i love the fact that a lot of staff are middle age but still very enthusiastic and friendly.Pricing - not the cheapest in Chinatown if you compare to Tak Po, but that is a complete ballgame all together.tips : - do not be tempted to order everything in 1 go no matter how big is your group. order 1st round a few items, see what you like and order again! then you get to enjoy piping hot dim sum rather than a table-full of lukewarm dim sum. - Remember to enjoy your dim sum with a pot of hot Chinese tea.- do not be intimidated by the menu that looks very extensive especially if you are new to dim sum. there is no right or wrong way to enjoy the good Chinese meal."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha! Enormous variety of tasty morsels,50,12-24-14,"Above the Santa Teresa Hotel, there is a lift if stairs aren't good for you! You either arrive early for lunch or dinner, or you will need to queue. I hate queues, but we did on our second visit because I knew what was coming. Yum Cha is frequented by locals too.... That is what I always look for! There are pictures and descriptions of every option and all you do is fill in your menu card and the food arrives. The food itself is amazing!Great place to be adventurous in your food selections and for us, we learnt more about how to blend flavours. This is a place we are still talking about and a friend is armed with the address for his visit in the New Year. TIP...... Get there about 1130 or slightly earlier for lunch if you do not like to wait and go armed with accurate directions."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sun Specialist,30,12-22-14,Eficient and friendly service. Good variety of dim sum. Tasty but not surprising. A place where local chinese families go. Over all an interesting experience. Advisable to arrive early as lines can be long.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good & tasty authentic dim-sum,40,12-14-14,"Almost all the dim-sum served are delicious, steamingly hot & in perfectly big sizes.
Lots of varieties which included Chinese noodles, fried rice, seafood and hot & cold Chinese dessert."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dim sum in Chinatown ,40,11-06-14,"We frequently go to Yum Cha for dim sum on a weekend either to dine in the restaurant or get take away. Efficient service and amazing dumplings and, for those who struggle finding vegetables that aren't swimming in oil in the food centres in Singapore, the broccoli is great! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,40,10-29-14,My friends and I visited for lunch. We choose a la carte so we filled in the order form and all our selections were brought to us. The lavender coconut dumpling was AMAZING! Prompt service and reasonably priced esp for Singapore.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent Dimsum,50,10-27-14,Worth the wait. Went there with family for Sunday Lunch...line to get in or get a table is long. best to get a reservation instead.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not Impressed,20,10-24-14,"We dined here recently as part of a group tour of China Town , the food was served promptly, but sadly very bland tasting , in fairness it was set menu and not really to my normal choice ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not to be missed in Chinatown,40,10-17-14,"People say that this is arguably the best dimsum in Singapore. Nice tradtional shophouse atmosphere, fresh dumplings, easily accessible by train, and in the heart of Chinatown. Great value for money as part of the Singapore experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dumplings and other yummy...,40,10-16-14,"meals are served in the nice location in a Shophouse in the middle of Chinatown - if you do not have the exact location, the restaurant is a little hard to find! Great food...not very very cheap, but very reasonable. Service....well, Singapore like most of the times! Still a place I would send people to go to and enjoy...top tip: dessert: Glutinous rice balls in a Ginger Tea. A must try...!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice Chinese breakfast,50,09-27-14,"It's in the Chinatown, you can experience the old Chinese dim sum restaurant. Food selection is excellent, taste is good and price is reasonable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Only acceptable for novice dim sum eaters,20,09-26-14,"Don't waste your time and money here. Limited selection, poor flavour, very very average. The dim sum you can buy frozen and steam yourself is better than this.On the plus side the service is pretty good, waitress was very attentive and kept my tea topped up. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dumplings in the heart of China Town,40,09-14-14,"Right in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha has the atmosphere revered by locals and tourists alike. It's always packed at lunch hour which ensures freshly baked dumplings by the minute. The crunchy banana& bean paste deep fried dumpling is the best way to finish a large selection of dim sums. And the top it all it's not expensive, always a bonus!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Small little Dim Sum place that's value for money!,40,09-08-14,"I heard quite a lot about this restaurant and always wanted to try it but didn't have the chance until very recently.Yum Cha, literally means, 'Drink Tea' in Chinese also means to having Chinese tea and dim sum. Dim Sum, small Chinese dishes. Think of it like servings of individual bites, in small portions.The location of the restaurant, in the middle of Singapore's Chinatown, adds to the allure of this place.The Dim Sum were had are surprisingly good, the portions just nice. Yum Cha does not skim on the ingredients and we could find whole pieces of shrimps, for example, in our Har Kow (Prawn Dumplings) and Prawn Chee Cheong Fun (Steamed Prawns in Rice Rolls). The fried carrot cake was very crispy and still soft to bite. Overall, I like the food and the price.However, the only dish I find not well done was the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun which I felt had too much oil and not enough of the light soy sauce.It is a very popular restaurant and do expect to queue for a while if you are going during the busy times of lunch and dinner."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good service and delicious food,50,09-01-14,"You can tell a good restaurant when it is used by locals and this one was packed. We didn't have to wait too long and it was well worth the wait, food was delicious and the sweet and sour fish was excellent. The staff work hard and are polite and served the dishes without delay. A good place to eat."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum just a block from Chinatown MRT,40,08-20-14,"I was recommended this from a friend, it's near the Santa Ana Grande hotel. Went around 9:30am on a Sunday morning.Meal wasn't overly expensive, and lots to choose from: either hot or cold options. Custard bun was good but be careful or it can pop open and you'll have custard sauce all over the table (or you!). Try a little of a few things and you can order more of the same if you like it. Good service, rarely have to wait long for them to come around again. It wasn't overly crowded yet so that was helpful.Depending on which direction you come from, it can be difficult to find the entrance, and you have to take stairs or elevator to 2nd floor to the restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dumplings!!! ,40,08-17-14,"I got this restaurant recommended by a local friend and went twice during a one week visit to Singapore. Yum Cha Restaurant is located in the heart of China Town. Both times I had a great dining experience, but I must say I enjoyed the second most, as it had a different set-up. First time I visited the restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon and we were served from a menu. The second time I visited it on a Saturday during lunch time and servers were passing by pushing trolleys with different dumpling you could choose from. Loved the fact you could actually see how the dumpling look like before choosing. The restaurant was both times packed with locals and expect to wait for a table, specially during lunch time. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent Sunday Dimsum,40,08-15-14,Get there early and great for a Sunday lunch. It is queue and wait and well worth the effort. Reasonably priced for good dim sum and sufficient through put of people not to be stale.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selections of Dim Sum..,40,08-02-14,Went there to try their Dim Sum Buffet after spend the morning at River Safari.. Was overwhelmed by the variety of delicious dim sums and we enjoyed it.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced,40,07-05-14,"I went to Yum Cha with friends while visiting Singapore at the end of June. The dim sum was good but I have had better, and overpriced for what it was. It was nice to see the place filled with locals, and our service was good. This place seems to be highly recommended to tourists but I believe there is better dim sum to be had in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Get Food,40,06-30-14,Enjoyed this restaurant as we went there on a tour then returned on our own. It was good value and the kids loved it
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dumplings ever!,50,06-27-14,"Filled with locals and has a great atmosphere, service was great and the food was fantastic, definitely recommend getting the first dumplings on the menu. A must to dine in singapore!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,thrilling.,40,06-24-14,"Nice place, quite hard to find, lost in the middle of the shops. But very goog food, decent and precise service. The dim sums are creative and awake curiosity and awoke my tatse buds very nicely. Spice is present but not invading."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Such good food!,50,06-07-14,"Whilst I had been warned that the service could be inconsistent but the food would be very tasty, I was disappointed on one front - the service. Both the food and the service were of the highest quality on the day we visited. Highly recommend you go early though!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Mediocre dim sum ,20,06-06-14,Came here for lunch with my mum and ordered the usual dim sum items like har gow and siew Mai.Sad to say that the standard has dropped. Skin of har gow was one of the thickest I've tried. Taste of the other items are average and pretty saltish.Guess this may be the last time I visit this place considering that there are just too many dim sum joints in Singapore.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Excellent, fresh, authentic",50,05-29-14,"The food was some of the best Chinese food I have had. Located in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha handled our large group very well. The food came out hot and was clearly well prepared. It tasted fresh and was nicely spiced. They were sensitive to folks' allergies and food preferences."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Always excellent value for money,40,05-27-14,"In the middle of Chinatown Singapore, up an old staircase is still one of the best Yum Cha/dim sum restaurants in town. I have no hesitation in taking visitors here and going there myself for my favourites. In a town where prices are going through the roof, this is great value for money. Nice mix of shoppers, tourists and locals."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Bad service and they steal cameras ,10,05-24-14,"Had such a terrible dinner here I eat a lot of Chinese food all over the world and this by far is the worst I have ever had.The waitresses were so rude and never explained what the food was when they put it down,had to ask for soya sauce. We were on a china town tour.The staff just stand there and stare at you like your a criminal,they refuse to remove dishes it was getting pretty crowded with 8 people at the table. Also when leaving one of the people apart of our group went to the bathroom and on her return her camera had been stolen by a staff member. This is terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the tour.I would never eat here again due to the lack of service and rudeness. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good timsum variety.,30,05-13-14,"Enjoyed the timsum. But in terms of service, it has a lot to be done. Atmosphere can be further improve too."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Why spoil it with silly add on charges,40,04-21-14,"Really nice, freshly cooked dim sum in authentic surroundings. No complaints, we visit here once or twice each year and it's consistently good but why oh why do they add on for a tiny bowl of peanuts on the table and for the service totes, 2.00 peanuts and 60 cents for each serviette. No big deal just silly. In addition to the dim sum menu we always ask for a bowl of plain rice which is great value at 1 dollar so we shall continue to visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very 'Yum'!,40,03-29-14,"Just had a Saturday lunch here with my son, his partner and my grand daughter and we all enjoyed the food.Trollies full of delicious steaming dim sum calling at our table every few minutes and it was a mighty effort demolishing the food fast enough so we could order refills!Good family atmosphere here and heaving with all sorts of people, the staff certainly weren't unfriendly, just extremely busy.The restaurant is situated at 20 Trengganu St in Chinatown amidst many other Chinese restaurants and a very short walk from Chinatown MRT.We ate plenty at the bill came to 72 Singapore Dollars."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent,30,03-27-14,"Strategic location in Chinatown, nice name for a restaurant too. The dim sum was nice and the food tasted good. The staff were not as friendly though. Sure it's a crowded restaurant, but smiling when you take someones order makes a difference."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum but watch out for,30,03-19-14,"The dim sum was nice I had (dinner), but charging for the peanuts on the table, charging for the wet towels, leave a Chinese rip off aftertaste.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum is delicious,40,03-14-14,Yum Cha Restaurant is on 2Floor in Santa Grand Hotel China Town. Dim Sum and congee is delicious but this restaurant don't have English menu.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dimsum,40,02-23-14,"Situated along Trengganu Street, it is around 5min walk from Chinatown MRT. Used to be quite small, it has now expanded so it was crowded (cos food was nice). It now seems to be partner of a hotel (same lift as Santa Grand Hotel). Service was not that great but that's to be expected. Dimsum was fresh and tasted good. Typical steamed ones would be around SGD4 (eg a basket of 4 siew mai/prawn dumpling SGD3.80; Lo Mai Kai SGD3.80). They have several types of chinese tea.Overall, very nice food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Yum Cha,30,02-12-14,"As other reviewers have said this restaurant is not so easy to find. After visiting this place it seems it is targeting the locals. Menu all Chinese, as we were leaving we got an English menu - handy!! Food quite good, plenty of choice and fresh. But didn't have any wow factor at all!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just another place for the casual visitors,20,01-21-14,"The location is good for visitors not knowing very little about Chinese food & culture. People who really like Chinese food would easily find better offerings elsewhere in a lot of food courts and eateries. Service was good though. Definitely not a suitable choice to bring your friends or guests, unless you are really very very hungry and happen to be nearby."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great location. Acceptable Food. Terrible Service. Stressful Ambience,20,01-19-14,"Located right in the heart China Town, this is a great location to bring visitors for a Dim Sum breakfast, but do not expect to be serviced, even though they charge 10% service fees. And be prepared for the noise and crowd of hungry (angry) people - on Sunday morning! We waited for more than 15 minutes without any dim sum trolly passing by, we indicated to the staff three times that we would like to have some dim sum. Unfortunately, all three of them ignore our requests separately. Everyone seems too busy to care or to talk to customers. Finally, after 20 minutes (it seems much longer when you are hungry), one of the trollies with steamed Dim Sum stop by. The lady in-charged of the trolly was attending to two other customers appeared from nowhere, despite acknowledging our existence. We literately have to 'fight' for her attention. There was no vinegar, ginger and soya sauce on the table, we have to grab it elsewhere ourselves. Another interesting thing is being charged for pickle or peanut which was not on the table, and we did not order. We paid S$22 per head for a stressful Sunday morning breakfast. I used to like the food here, but I will give it a miss after this torturious experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but not great",40,01-14-14,"Solid Dim Sum place in Singapore. Not the best dim sum I've ever eaten in my life, quite good nevertheless. If you're a fan, you'd probably like it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you are a dumpling fan - great,30,01-13-14,We went to this restaurant as my friend is a dumpling fan - so it that is you then you will love it. A couple of us who are not so partial to the white saggy testicle like sacks will be disappointed as there was not much else on offer!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent Dim Sum in Chinatown,30,01-12-14,The dim sum here is decent. I live in New York City where there are several good dim sum restaurants. Yum Cha compares to them.I did appreciate the menu separating the steamed dishes from the fried dishes. The restrooms need to be cleaned. Service is fine.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tea quality is not good enough. Some dishes are pretty high in price.,40,01-11-14,"I liked the big selection of different snacks that you can choose from. I disliked the tea they served. I expect better quality tea leaves in a ""Yum Cha Place"". After all, the authentic Yum Cha is having ""tea drinking"" as the core of the enjoyment, supported by snacks of different kinds. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dimsum in Chinatown,40,12-31-13,"There are several dim sum restaurants in Chinatown - this one stands out for several reasons.1. Ambience is the best of the lot, with the look and feel of a classy Chinese restaurant.2. It attracts the most tourists. Expect long queues during peak hours esp. Weekends.Dim sum is generally good - standout dishes being the fried glutinous rice, custard dumpling and steamed beef balls.Prices have been steadily increasing and a dim sum meal for two should be about $40-$50 now.Service can be compromised on peak days with urgency to clear the queue as quickly as possible."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Terrible, this is",10,12-26-13,"Me and my family had to wait for very long. Toilet is dirty, the supervisor is rude and generally i will not come back again"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average yumcha good service,30,12-25-13,"I visited this restaurant upon recommendation from my taxi driver.i expected a really awesome culinary experience but it was very ordinary.i had prawn wanton which were cold and too appetising, xiao long bao which was already but broke easily not the best and seafood dumplings that were lacking in flavour.i love dim sum so I was disappointed. The meal was reasonable $4 for each choice.it was very Average"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The best Dim Sum in Chinatown,40,12-13-13,It is great this restaurant. The dim sum is delicious. After 3:00pm they have open buffet with a lot of different choices. The decoration is very nice and cozy.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious Chinese dinner,50,12-04-13,We took Roasted duck for four persons here and we love it much. they made us full after order a lot of foods. Good taste.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrific dim sum - great location,40,11-22-13,This is one of my favorite places for a weekend breakfast of dim sum. I highly recommend you go early (9ish) because the place fills up quickly. The quality of their dim sum is great. The staff are always hustling around to bring the food to the diners. Don't be shy or you'll miss an opportunity for your fave dim sum to go to another diner!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great atmosphere and food,40,11-21-13,Yum cha in Chinatown is a must and we stumbled on this restaurant. The entrance can be a bit tricky to find but people will point the way. It was Sunday so very busy and the waitress helped by bringing dishes we pointed to in the menu to our table (although it's more fun to choose from the trolley especially if you have no idea what it is). Some of the dishes are pretty standard but we had a few exceptional ones as well eg the crab and five treasures soup. It was a little pricey as we got stung for extras on the table (peanuts) and we think a ten dollar surcharge. But it was fun.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food but...,40,11-10-13,"Good variety of authentic Chinese yum cha
I went there with a friend
The only problem is that is a little bit disorganized service
Expect to wait to be seated for approx 15-20 min"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great fresh food,40,11-10-13,Don't really need to say anything else except ......don't miss eating here when in Singapore. The food is fantastic.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dimsum heaven!,50,11-04-13,"We went on a busy Saturday lunch, hence, the relatively long wait. But it was worth the wait.Trolley and trolley of food will pass by your table and It can be intimidating to the uninitiated.Clueless about what to order, just point and ask, and the staff will answer the best they can. Surprise yourself and randomly choose what ever fancies your eye. If you have food allergies, make sure to ask whats inside as there are a number of food with shrimps and crab meat. And, yes, do try the peking duck (if available)."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Definitely the best Dim Sum in Singapore,40,11-02-13,"Loved the variety of dim sum available. The menu is in Chinese so did not really know what to order. But they bring the dim sum in a trolley and you can pick whatever looks good. It did match the great dim sum I had in Shenzhen (China) some time back. Very authentic. It is not really a fancy restaurant, but gives you a feel of how food is enjoyed in China."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,some yummy dim sum but not as good as Taiwan,30,11-02-13,"I was disappointed, to be fair, that the promised trolley service was not available on the Friday we visited: weekends only! The long biao xai was good enough and the mixed seafood in green casing really delicious, but some of dumplings were a bit sticky and hard to extract from the steamer. Disappointed not to have any green vegetables at all so the meal is all a bit stodgy. Service good and friendly and the tea was tasty. Having feasted at the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei, it's a hard act to follow!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but not Great,30,11-02-13,Eating here may be a little intimidating for the non frequent traveller as within 1 minute of sitting down you will be presented with 5 to 7 bowls of food but rear assured this happens to each diner. Be prepared to say No and ask for the menu with pictures and english descriptions.The food was really quite enjoyable and the service was reasonable.There are some odd components though to this place like being billed for nuts that are already on the table and napkins (hand wipe) even though it was only $0.60.Is a real hit with locals though which is always a good sign.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,50,10-26-13,"My GF and I had the lunchtime all you can eat Dim Sum, they have a great trolley (several in fact) and also a la carte, you can pick and choose from both.Staff were very friendly constantly bringing more dishes.Best Dim Sum I've had, including places in China and London!It's tucked away upstairs but quite easy to find.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to have your first dim sum experciences,30,10-24-13,nice place to have your first dim sum experiences.the resturant has the same name as the near by hotel and is a bit hidden behind the shops.the quality and kwantity of the food is good. but it lost its charme and the services is poor.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Hard to find, easy to enjoy",50,10-23-13,Look behind the stalls for the small sign and stairs leading up to Yum Cha. It is better than anything else in the neighborhood. We had the Dim Sum and were very pleased with the quality and quantity. As we sat there we could see other full dinner platters pass by to tables in other rooms that were having full meals. They looked wonderful. Except for the beer the prices were very good. Plan on just one beer or none at all. The tea is a very good alternative both for quality and price.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim-sum, but poor service",30,10-17-13,"We can't make reservation to take dim-sum buffet in Jade of Fullerton Hotel.So we went another famous dim-sum restaurant named ""Yum Cha""It is located in temple street of China Town.There's so many people in queue even it's almost end of lunch time.There're many kinds of steamed and fried dim-sum.Most of dim-sum taste good, but service is very poor. We ordered and ordered repeatedly, but our dishes not served fast. So it took so long time to finish our lunch."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tasty pepper crab,40,10-09-13,"The food is somewhat better than the other chinese places, I've been to. Nice pepper crab, tasty tofu and shiitake... No great lover of chinese food, but this was ok. Service is acceptable, but by no means accomodating. Entrance is in the bach of a store. Look out!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Superb!!,50,09-16-13,"This was a superb experience in China Town. Look on google maps for location, and its upstairs in a little hotel. There was a fast moving queue, as this place is really popular with the locals. The food was absolutely delicious, and all freshly prepared. Once seated, the ladies come around with a trolley loaded with baskets of dim sum……just choose what you want to eat - get a mixture of baskets. I would avoid the spinach with garlic, as it was a plate of stalks……..they said it didn't come with leaves!!! Ummm!! But all in all, don't go to China Town without paying this little diamond a visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A Local Legacy - Good Food - Simple Dining,30,09-12-13,I have mixed feelings about Yum Cha. I ate there two years ago with friends from the US who were working in Singapore. They raved about the best Dim Sum at Yum Cha so we mad our way to Chinatown upstairs to Yum Cha and had a delightful meal.I returned there a month ago and then took my family last week when we visited Chinatown. Its evident that this is a local establishment that continues to serve very good quality dim sum. I would have given Yum Cha a higher rating if their staff had been a little more gracious rather then just efficient and if the atmosphere was a bit warmer however this is my personal opinion based on my past two visits which were quite different than my first time dining there.If you are in Chinatown its worth checking out although a bit challenging to find the entrance in the shopping arcade.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Thought we were being filmed for a prank,10,08-11-13,"We went to this restaurant on 10th August as part of a Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour and it was supposed to be a Chinese Dinner......however it was just a joke...the staff were downright rude, the 4 courses of food were put down all the same time from the soup to the mango pudding...they were reluctant to lift dirty plates away....a table of 9 people and no lazy susan to pass the food around which had been ""dumped"" on the table with no explanation.....we also had plastic cutlery and the money for the drinks which were not included in the pre paid trip was demanded whilst we were still eating by a sour faced waitress.....the food was pretty awful, it was bland and also cold when it arrived.......I would not recommend this place....I kept waiting on someone jumping out and saying we had been ""pranked""...just a joke......."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Nice food, quite authentic environment, value for money",40,08-09-13,"Located in the 2nd floor of this shop house in Chinatown, it's one of the traditional style of dim sum service - push carts, a nice touch.Food is very good - everything from Siew Mai, Har Gow, Char Siew Pow, Lo Mai Kai.I personally felt the porridge was average.Try the crav meat soup dumpling, around sgd6.80 per bowl, really nice."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Old style dumpling service with carts on wooden floor, very nice",40,08-03-13,"The Xiao long bao is Excellent, you need to ask for it as it does not make it on to the carts. The dumplings are uniformly very good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Reasonably Priced Buffet,40,07-31-13,"The dim sum buffet offers good value and selection. The quality was above average as compared to other dim sum outlets out there.Service wasn't the best but I've experienced worse. They do seem short of staff during peak hours, hence, the slower service.As for comments on being charged for napkins, tea and peanuts, from my experience, it seems like a fairly normal practice here for Chinese restaurants. You can opt not to have the peanuts and napkins by returning them if you do not want to pay for them."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Don't like it,20,07-23-13,"The food was good, my family all agrees with that. but we had to pay for the foods that we didn't even order, and the food came out really late. I think it is because we are foreigners. We also had to pay for peanuts and wet tissue even though they were there at first!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good food, but the service is bad",30,07-21-13,"The food is good,but the service and the ambience is not good at all. We also got the bill without even asking -I guess, the staff wanted to go home."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Steer Clear Of This One!,10,07-20-13,"This is the worst Yum Cha style restaurant I have eaten at in the world. Awful service, awful food and vibe non existent.
Worst meal of my trip this year by far!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good place.. Good food,40,06-29-13,Visited last may.. We had a great experience.. Recommended place.. I enjoy the food enjoy also the ambience... I hope I can visit this place again in the future
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Avoid this place,10,06-10-13,"We been recommend this place by a local guy in the market, the service was very poor, the food average. We were shocked to see the bill- they tryed to charge us $2 for peanuts and $0.80 for each napkins..we refused to pay them for it as they was on the table when we got there and no one told us its not free. I think we got this bad vibe from them only because we not local people."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service :Practice Racism,20,06-08-13,"Avoid this place if u are Asian .... They don't serve Asian well...we were there sitting at one of tr corner for 10 mins with no one serving us, they kept telling us that dim sum trolleys will come and serve us, but the 2 tables with Caucasians next to us were able to order and they serve the dim sum to their table, well I thought we can do the same but they kept asking us to wait, wait and wait. We asked another waitress if we can order the food instead of waiting the trolley since it took ages for the trolley to serve to the corner we sat, but the other waitress told us to wait too ..... Seem likes this is their management direction n we decided to bring our money somewhere else ..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,cheap and good,40,05-06-13,cheap and good. location is very close to the hotel.china town was very fun. but some people do not understand even English. i thought is this Singapore
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good staple yum cha or dim sum,30,04-20-13,"WE recently went here for a work lunch. you need to get here before 12pm otherwise the queues are huge and on sunday, this restaurant is very popular so get there early. Its very good for basic yum cha/dim sum - steamed dumplings, wantons, spring rolls, rice rolls, congee and rice and noodles. The service is ""brisk"" and its pretty cheap and cheerful kind of place with less of the ""cheap"". It is moderately expensive for what it provides."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,spkendid,30,04-19-13,"nice food, nice staffm best tastying saudies and ummy burgers tuna was fish but coconut was runny, Squid was tough but waiters nice and chummy."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha - Nice Dim Sum,50,04-18-13,I like the dishes here coz they are delicious and affordable. Like the push carts ladies selling their wares.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,50,04-11-13,"This appealing second floor place in Chinatown serves the best dim sum anywhere we have been, including home-base NY, Hong Kong, Hawaii, etc.Everything is cooked to order, as opposed to the cute roving carts often seen. You order yourself, guided by the list which has many photos of items. Wonderful flavors and combination of ingredients such as snow peal leaf/prawn dumplings, prawn asparagus dumplings and many more. Service is efficient if not personable. Ice cold Tiger draught.This is a ""must try"" aNd definitely worth returning to if you have the time."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,terrible service; fair food,10,04-10-13,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel (Conrad Centennial) and was also in the DK Eyewitness Travel Book. I asked for a table by the window and they said it was for a larger group; but then they sat two people there. We had a variety of waitresses, all of whom could care less. Ordered a springroll, bok choy, and duck. they first brought the bok choy, much later the spring roll, and fianlly the duck. The quality of the food was good but the service was abominable, and the order of the food was really strange. At the end of the meal when we received the check they charged us for the handiwipes (they never gave us napkins) and for nuts on the table that we never ate. All in all, a big disappointment and really poor service with an attitude."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum craze!,50,03-30-13,"I loved this place. The more the merrier! Not the most straight forward way to find the entrance, but clear enough. Once up on the 2nd Floor, you get welcomed by... people queuing! But do not give up, because the turn-over rate is factory-like and you will be seated in no time. I think I waited 10 or 15 min once, but it is worth it! A woman cruise by to note down how many of you will be eating (that's how the queue never stays long enough for you to complain, usually). You get to your table and get served straight away some Jasmine tea, and then either trollies or waitresses zig-zag between tables to present you their freshly steamed or fried dishes. The waitresses then tick the boxes on the receipt that lives on the table. Generally you will end up with a USD 20 note per person, and that is for a full belly! I only tried the Dim Sum and other buns, but it had became my Sunday ritual and I recommend it to whoever stops in Singapore long enough to visit this restaurant.Ho, and please try the mango Sago. It's a liquid mango dish with clear rice beads, and it is soooo refreshing. Do get rebutted by its appearance, and try it!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very large restaurant and good menu and yum cha all day and night.,40,03-24-13,Very good hrs to do yum cha. Food very good and prices very good. Up on the 1st floor off Temple St. We were given a good recomendation by a local to this restaurant.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food - good prices,50,03-24-13,"We were recommended this restaurant - went for yum cha, steamed dumplings were great, Peking duck pancakes yummy and fried prawn wontons great. Spring rolls only average. Friendly service and a mix of local and western customers. 6 dishes, peanuts and 3 soft drinks cost $S36. Would definately return"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just not the warm friendly Singapore we know and love,10,03-22-13,"From the moment we entered the staff were sour and certainly far from sweet. No help was offered ordering and when the bland dull food arrived we had to ask for bowls which were ceremoniously dumped still stacked on the table, how a place like this exists I do not know, maybe they just don't like foreigners and are happy to rely on local trade, most certainly would never go back or in deed recommend."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy Xiaolongba,40,03-19-13,"We have been here a few times now, and have even taken visiting guest here. The dim sum is very good the Xiaolongba are very tasty, as the is the deep fried banana and red bean and the mango pudding. Service is a bit slow though, but we think its worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fast and good,30,02-16-13,Upstairs in a corner in Chinatown. A mix of Chinese and tourist diners so they are doing something right. The food is good enough. Not amazing but hits the spot. Nothing in Singapore is cheap (except the trains) and this place is no exception.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Divine food.... A couple of staff need to learn to smile,50,01-27-13,"An awesome array of yum cha, each one of which was melt in your mouth, from the ink squid dumpling to the mango and prawn roll with sesame, the treasure soup....expertly and accurately appeared on our table. Loved how they were served in the order we had ticked them on the menu so we knew exactly what we were eating. We would have loved to return, but the crowds preparing for Chinese New Year prevented us from reaching it again. BTW there is now a lift as well as the wooden staircase that used to be the only entry.we were lucky not to have to wait when we arrived......there was a huge queue as we left. Only criticism is the two staff who were a little grumpy and need to learn how to smile"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinatown Restaurant,40,01-27-13,"I wrote in my book, BBQ Port Bun - OMG! Perfectly cooked garlic softshell crab. Pan fried pork pancake, really good, fragrant, not like pancake we think of in the states! Great energy at this restaurant. Not supergreat customer service but I would go back."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Would hv rated as 'Excellent' if not for captain Zhou Ling,30,01-01-13,"I had to wait for my eldest daughter to return from Melbourne before visitng Yum Cha again bcos she loves dim sum alot. So, together with my family I bought along my mother to sup before 2013 appears. We found new dishes eg chocolate pretzel sticks which are Pork Springrolls, the very colorful Baked Cheese Seafood tarts & the Chive Dumpling. They are good, give them a try. Our fav & Best dishes are still the Durian dumpling (moochi), Beijing Duck, Crispy Red Bean paste wt Banana pancake, Century Egg congee, siu mai, har kao, phoenix claws, carrot cake, etc. One particular dish that seem to drop standard is the Char Siu chee cheong fun which used to have thinner & softer skin. A standing ovation we would give to is waitress Ms Leong Lai Chee for her excellent service & beautiful waiting attitude. She carried out her duties without any flaws but full of our praises and profesionally done. Our cups were continually filled up without having to remind her at any moment, hats off to her. She cleared our used plates promptly & timely and replenished with new ones efficiently and courteously, everytime with a genuine smile on her face. The climax was when she efficiently served us the Beijing Duck with such promptness. She made our lunch a great JOY indeed. I was very disappointed with the Captain who first attended to us when we stepped in, Ms Zhou Ling despite only 3 tables in the hall at the point we were seated. She seemed to display both in action and vocal tone that she's either serving us out of obligation or out of reluctance. Her physical gestures combined with her facial expresssions and her sarcastic tone of voice when she answered our enquiries or during serving us were congruent to poor service as a Captain. We felt we were not welcomed, if not for Ms Leong & subsequently for Captain Ivy Lim's presence. Halfway through our feasting, Captain Ivy Lim replaced Zhou Ling (we dont know for what reasons). She was bubbly and excited to see us dining as a family. In fact, with her presence she brighten up our dining experience with her resourcefulness and cheerfulness, unlike Zhou Ling's lethargic & unwelcoming body language. Next, is our praises to aunty Ong Ah Choo, who never failed deliver dishes with a good-feeling attitude and genuine smile everytime we dined here, countless times already. This is the real 'unsung heroine' whom many customers take for granted and would never mention good of her to management. Such is the character that made my family want to come back again and again besides the cosy clean ambience, the good food and the correct pricing. One of the very best take away we would buy home is the sambal belachan. Die die must try. My family reckons and votes this to be the very best in the whole of Singapore. Kudos to the chef."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,First-Class Hai Huang Yi Pin Porridge,40,01-01-13,An appetizing light well-seasoned luscious porridge with a delightful aroma which gratify one's gustatory sense
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE,40,12-21-12,"We went to this Restarant in a group of about 100 people. It's obviously a very popular Restaurant for Tourists and locals alike, because there was lots of people waiting to get in. Aside from that the food and service is very good. Their speciality is Dim Sum served in typical Cantonese style. We had a fixed menu and all the dishes was very tasty if you like that type of food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the few old places left,40,12-06-12,"Yum Cha is a great original Dim Sum restaurant with the old trolley System, serving great assortment of Dim Sumcharging for the extras is typical in Singapore bring yourOwn napkins,,,Lobster is expensive in Singapore food is expensive period.The food is great and the Staff helpfulCome with a good attitude and you walk home with a great experience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dim sum in Chinatown - just get there early,40,11-25-12,Despite the reviews about grumpy staff we were pleasantly surprised and had an enjoyable lunch. Good selection of average quality dim sum in a great location if you're in China town. Staff were helpful and responsive. Get there early to avoid the long queues.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Avoid this place!,10,11-22-12,"Terrible service, food without taste and very rude crew. Be careful! They even charge for the napkins. And if when you sit on the table, they offer you complementary pickles, don't accept it. They will charge you in the end without warning."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Bad night,10,11-22-12,"After reading the reviews of Trip Advisor me and my boyfriend decided to go to Yum Cha Restaurant.What we thought it would be a plesant dinner end it up being a headache.My boyfriend order the lobster but never specified the weight of it. The waitress decided by herself. Then when the bill came, we had to pay too much money for an average meal.The bill also included the peanuts that we never order and the hand towels that another waitress gave me when I asked for napkins. Unbelieveble..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"good food, friendly people",40,11-18-12,the food quality not so bad..tasty too but the dessert still not as good as the one i had at canton-I :) very friendly and helpful people..
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Old school Dim Sum,40,11-16-12,Quaint and simple with push-carts and noisy environmnt. But food tastes good and good for an informal lunch or tea with friends.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very yummy!,50,11-13-12,"I am a local and this is my 2nd visit. The pushcart dim sum is fantastic and I actually prefer this style to ordering, as u can see the exact dish and decide whether you want it.The food is great and inexpensive.I'm surprised that other reviewers commented about the bad service? They are mostly Chinese aunties who were quick and efficient in handing dishes to us. Maybe they don't smile too much and describe the dishes in detail, but that's because they can't speak much English and I don't fault them at all. :) Don't expect 5 star hotel service because that's not what this place is about. It's fantastic for its food, efficiency and atmosphere. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good food, horrible service, filthiest bathrooms I've ever seen",20,11-06-12,"How to rate this place I wonder. The food we ended up ordering was good but the road to getting there was not without hassle. Due to non-smiling, no english speaking, non-personal and frankly non-caring about anything or anyone staff at this place you are on your own figuring out the menu. If you would know what to get it wouldn't be a problem and you just don't give a crap about the horrible, unhelpful service. Unfortunately, we were without help and ended up with a bit of a strange menu mix of dim sums. True, they were good but I feel it could have been so much better. Only go here with advice or knowing your stuff and you'll have an awesome lunch/dinner. Otherwise avoid it because you'll leave the place not feeling totally satisfied and there is no need for that in this part of town."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A good dim sum place,30,11-05-12,"Yum Cha is your usual dim sum place. It's pretty good quality, but not exceptional. They didn't have cheong fun when we visited, which was a disappointment."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Would have got ten out of ten, but staff were glum",40,10-30-12,"Terrific classic yum cha food. It was full of flavour, generous servings of prawns, yummy slippery and crispy coatings on tasty fillings. Servings were attractive.It was inexpensive, quick and has a very pleasant ambience, apart from the somewhat glum waitrons.Sited in an old shop house, up a flight of lovely teak stairs, it is in the middle of the bustling and crazy night market. Certainly the place to visit in Chinatown. Loved the food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum on trolleys,40,10-27-12,"Fabulous authentic dim sum delivered by waitresses pushing choosing trolleys . Excellent value great choices friendly efficient staff. We were upstairs and it was busy at midday on Saturday. Chinese tea and beer, plenty of dim sum 5 eating 80 dollars. Hope we shall go again"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lots of interesting dim sum stuff,50,10-26-12,"Very good value, full juicy dim sum pieces, innovative too. Love the banana red bean fritter. Also love the various prawn-based dumplings and the noodles are good. I also always use their delivery service. Good food!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but very noisy,40,10-09-12,"The food was good. Service so so only. However the atmosphere wasn't good as it was like a market, simply too noisy. It is always with long queue and if you really want to go, remember to make reservation one or two days in advance. And reservation is very strict, cannot be late. Suggest to let customers fill up the menu slip on what they want to eat rather than pushing the carts around because the restaruant itself is not spacious enough. The restaurant sign board is not easily seen along the road. If you are driving, the parking is not cheap, $1 per half an hour."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Average food, sullen waitresses",30,10-06-12,"The dim sum was pretty average - nowhere near the Crystal Jade standard. Restaurant has a quaint chinatown location, but the waitresses were pretty unfriendly and some even quite rude. I wouldn't go back there."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,40,09-29-12,"Nice Chinese restaurant.
They have good dim sum, chilli crab even. Best thing is they have delivery service."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious!,50,09-28-12,"Recommended by a local and we were not disappointed. Very good, fresh dim sum - very speedy service, lots of locals which is always a good sign and delicious food so perfect for a tourist who wants good food at a reasonble priced without having to spend hours waiting around. Would definately go back!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for Yum Cha!!,50,09-28-12,"Located just of Temple St, this restaurant is always busy with locals and those tourists lucky enough to know about it. During peak times there can be a line up to get in but they turn over the tables quite quickly so usually the wait is not bad. They provide an excellent menu with pictures of each dish, so can order off the menu or wait for the trolley to come around and take what is there..Food is excellent quality, staff are efficient and service is fast.Will always visit when going to Singapore!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Most relished dim sums,40,09-27-12,"This place lives upto its name - awesome dim sums and you will be spoilt for choice. the menu is very friendly, it has images of each of the dish.
Dessert recommendation - Egg Tarts."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not bad but poor service,40,09-25-12,"I tried the weekday tea buffet which was good value because you can order as much as you want. Food was pretty good, there were plenty of steamed and fried dumplings and other dishes you can order as well. Prices have increased from last time and they did take out some dishes (eg. sweet and sour pork) that used to be there before. Service is poor - almost all the waiters there speak mostly chinese and they give you attitude as and when they feel like it. Ordering from them is hard and requesting simple things like water can be a challenge. The waiters/waitresses there never smile and are impatient when taking orders or answering questions. Food that we ordered did take quite sometime to come so be prepared to wait if you don't want to fill up quickly on the fried dumplings they repeatedly serve you on a cart that they go around with. The century egg porridge was a big disappointment because there was about 1/4 century egg inside the porridge. We liked the desserts - mango pudding, egg tarts and red bean pancake. It can be very crowded and noisy, especially on weekends."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum and very good value,50,09-23-12,"I always bring visitors to Yum Cha for the experience and of course the food. The service is usually average to poor, its incredibly noisy at lunchtime at the weekend and you usually have to queue for a table.However it is all worth it for the food. Excellent dim sum, great flavors and incredible value for money. Can't say its a relaxed experience but definitely a 'must' if you are visiting Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is good but service is unpredictable,30,09-22-12,"I've been patronising here since its inception when our favorite Jumbo Restaurant left Serangoon Gardens Country Club. The ambience is grand wt high ceilings & spacious. Very good for inviting guests & family gatherings. Food is good but slightly on the pricey side. Dim Sums are good and lots of variety to choose from either order through waiters or pick from the push-carts. Seafood is presentable and nice but the crabs may not be always packed and meaty unlike No Signboard Restaurant which never fails to serve good quality meaty packed crabs. Service can be unpredictable & depends on your luck. Our first few visits were unfortunate to have this one female supervisor, Mag, who was blatantly rude, unprofessional & ill-treating us & other neighboring tables too. I feedbacked to Simon, the manager, but he coudln't do much to improve. At times, we had an excellent supervisor named John but sadly he has left after our 6th visit. Simon is stll there and he still behaves with an indifferent attitude, one ear in one ear out. Occasionally, the waiting time for our dishes was late and delayed despite several reminders. I reckon Simon needs to improve his attitude to serve diners with a heart and not just as a manager title. I find the elderly aunties who serve dishes are nicer, more pleasant, courteous and friendlier than the supervisors or Simon. With UOB cards there's discount.I normally hold celebrations like birthdays, Mothers Day, reunions, gatherings in this place due to its proximity to my house. Oyes, parking is ample and can be valet too. Sad to say, the standards have dropped through the years. Also because the management are not willing to listen to genuine feedbacks from their loyal & faithful supporters. Seems to play hard to reach giving the impression of aloofness & cold."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food for an inexpensive meal,40,09-18-12,Food is very good and good variety of choices for dim sum. Very busy during lunch though. Breakfast and tea time is better
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Better atmosphere on the week end,40,09-17-12,"Nice chinese restaurant with good food, lot of chinese people come during the week end with their family all the generation together, the old women serve you, kids like so much !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Fun, slight chaotic but enjoyable",40,09-04-12,"Being from out of town the concierge recommended Yum Cha for Dim Sum. If you are looking for a quite, intimate meal, Yum Cha is not the place for you. Of course there was a line and once you got in you got a feel for the rhythm and the controlled chaos. I had so much fun picking and choosing what to eat and asking for recommendations from the staff. I was not disappointed and all the flavors were new a enjoyable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Popularity forces us to downgrade our rating,30,08-31-12,"I used to be a big fan of Yum Cha. However, it has grown in popularity so much that (1) there is always a wait for a table, (2) the staff are overwelmed and getting a waitress' attention is a struggle, (3) because of the full tables, it is hard for the ""dim sum"" carts to move between tables, meaning that it is hard to get food, (4) it is very noisy, and (5) trying to pay one's bill takes a long time. Our trip there for lunch last Saturday was just not fun. I also noticed that food quality has gone down and prices have inched up. I recommend going to one of the many other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood -- after all, all Chinese food is about the same: lots of sauces and MSG."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent service!,50,08-30-12,"I ordered Yum Cha delivery today for my colleagues and wow I am so impressed! We ordered Set A and 3 other ala carte items for 12 adults. What impressed me, besides the delicious food, was their thoughtfulness and attention to little details! The delivery man carried all the food to the allocated place, which required him to climb up the stairs. Then, he took out a disposable table cloth and started laying all the food. I offered to help but he kindly declined, saying it is part of his job. What impressed me further was the fact that my delivery came with disposable cutlery that was catered for more then 20 adults and even had several garbage bags! Wow, I am really impressed! Each of us paid $11 for this delivery and we definitely agree that the portions could feed another 3 adults for sure! Thumbs UP for Yum Cha! You are a gem!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum,50,08-16-12,Every time I'm in Singapore I go at least twice to this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Dim sum is fantastic (reasonable prices) and the lobster noodles are over the top (but expensive). My favorite is steam dim sum but I have to say that the deep fried mango and prawns rolls are great. I suggest to drink chinese tea with dim sum and here the chinese jasmine tea is excellent quality. At the weekends you don't have to order from the menu because you can choose directly from the trolley passing by the tables.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha,40,08-09-12,"Last weekend, I took some Australians friends to Yum Cha for breakfast. Out of the 15 reviews for this year, half have four and five stars. My friends enjoyed the food, the dim sums are fresh (especially those with prawns), and I findthe service greatly improved from my last visit. The moment I flipped over the cover of the tea pot (meaning that they should refill the pot) someone quickly took the pot away and came back with a fresh pot of tea. We left behind one small pau, but one of the elderly waitress saw this and insisted we should not waste and she went to put it in a small bag for us. I will visit again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,yummy in my tummy,50,08-03-12,"dim sum is one of those things that can either be wonderful or tatseless , yum cha has a menu of plenty options and wonderous things to chose from me and my partner have fallen in love with dim sum ever since i came back from hong kong and introduced him to it , anything steamed IS GOOOOOOD!!! yum cha is always busy but always easy to get a seat never waiting more then 5 mins .its cheap cheerful and right in the middle of chintowns markets , a little hard to find at first but just ask a local and they will point u in the right direction ..enjoy it ! and tell me alllll about it"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Yumcha I have had!,40,07-29-12,This is a feast not for the faint hearted. The pork buns are truly amazing! The sauce they use is so tasty. The service was lacking but lets be honest its all about the food! 3-5pm they do cheap Yumcha and we wish we had more time to go back again!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Is this as good as it gets in Singapore?,20,06-23-12,"So we are Yum Cha fanatics and were excited to be in a largely Chinese city with the opportunity to indulge ourselves. We were very disappointed. The restaurant was ok the service was not bad but the food was mush. Poor fillings, tasteless dumplings and weak sauces. If you have Yum Cha regularly in either London or Melbourne dont bother coming here. Trip Advisor is usually very good for recomendations but not his time."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Kinda basic, but the food is great!",40,06-20-12,"My husband and I have been to Yum Cha a couple of times now, once in 2010 and once just last month. It's a fairly decent restaurant, slightly hidden away if you don't know where it is - the restaurant is kinda sparse, hence my 'basic' title .. there are no fancy frills here! The staff are ok, I mean they do their job and serve you quickly, but it's a place for striking up conversation or having a joke with the staff .. it's just about serving (which is fine, though can sometimes come across a little unfriendly). The food however is amazing! We love the dim sum, congee, and there are these amazing prawn and mango rolls which are just incredible! In 2010 we also had some kind of deep fried prawns hung over the side of a half carved out pineapple - we couldn't get that this time but they do still serve it, and it's delicious! Even though the service/decor is pretty ordinary, the food is amazing, and it's a perfect spot to go for lunch or dinner after spending the day in Chinatown. We'll always go back!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but good enough",30,06-14-12,"It is a good restaurant, descent food, good service, and great location. I wouldn't say this is the best dim sum, it is worth a try and pretty famous in Singapore. It is crowded during meals peak hour so reservation is suggested."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worth a try,30,06-11-12,"The dimsum variation quite alot, and it taste great! The prawn is freshly made, and there are some new variation of dimsum that you cant find somewhere else. However, the service is not so good. Alot of customers yet so little waiter around. Anyway you can view some photos in my blog, cassijes.blogspot.com : D"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Honest food,30,06-10-12,"Nested upstairs in Chinatown, no problem withe the range and flavor of the food but there isn't much joy /personality from the staff and the ambience is light compared to other places in the area. Pricing suggests more work needed on these points."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese New Year dim sum,40,05-20-12,"We were able to get a last minute seating on Chinese New Year. We only waited about 10 minutes. Pretty decent dim sum where there are ladies with carts and well as being able to order off the menu. All the basic choices available included hakaw, shumai, egg custard pies, lo mi kai, cha siew boa, etc. Not the best dim sum I've had (in LA:)) but definitely quality. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dim Sum in Chinatown!,50,04-29-12,Great place to get Dim Sum right in the heart of Chinatown!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old Yum Cha charm,40,04-07-12,"We took the High Tea Buffet Promotion - $21.80++ for adults and $16.80++ for children 3pm-6pm (Last order at 5.30pm).Even thou it's a weekday we got a shock when we enter as there's a huge crowd; we manage to get a table along the restaurant pathway (which is a good choice). :)We were presented with a menu (which is a A4 size red colour paper), a total of 67 items were listed. There's 5 categories: Steam Dim Sum, Fried Dim Sum ,Rice,Rice Roll & Congee, Side Dishes & Dessert.The waitress will be pushing a cart around with all the Steam/Fried Dim Sum & Side Dishes, just tell her what u want or u could simply point at the dishes (if u not sure what's the dish name, like us) and it will be put onto yr table. Or u could order from the menu, dish name is in English & Chinese.We were so overwhelm be the variety of Dim Sum available that we just keep pointing and ended up with a table cover full of food! The Dim Sum were pipping hot & fresh, personally I like the steam stuff better as I found the fried Dim Sum a tad too oily.I would advise to get yr hand on the baked mini egg tarts & coconut tarts half way though yr meal and not wait till last as they run out pretty fast, it's really delicious.A good way to end the meal with the lemongrass jelly with fruits, the slight tangy favor of lemongrass is refreshing after a full meal.It's a nice place to have a meal and play catch-up with friend or family member. Just don't seat too far away from the pathway, cos at times it's had to catch the attention of the waitress & the push cart may not be able to go near yr table."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fantastic Food and Service,50,03-07-12,"Was a little put off by some of the reviews but we found this restaurant fantastic. Couldnt fault the food or the service.We had the afternoon tea (buffet all you can eat). They came around with push-carts and the manager was very attentive. We asked for a particular dish that didnt seem to be on any of the carts and after about 5 mins a lady brought us a plate to the table... they had made the dish especially for us and you could tell how fresh all the dishes tasted.We did seem to be the only Westeners there, but doesnt that say its good, eat where the locals eat is our motto.Much smaller than Maxim's in Hong Kong but just as good we thought."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food,50,03-02-12,"This restaurant has very good dim sum, great menu, and good service, always busy."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Delicious Dim Sum, although dear.",40,02-19-12,"I've visited Yum Cha several times with my family, and always had fine meals. This is something of an accomplishment, given the surly disposition of the management and the unhelpful wait-staff (many of whom don't speak English). The challenge is to secure the items one intends; photos of many varieties of dim sum in the menu are of considerable help.You're going to spend a good deal of money to satisfy a healthy appetite, but the quality of the flavors you'll experience may well dull the pain in your wallet! Stated simply: Yum Cha does dim sum right!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Definitely the place for Dim Sum when you are in Chinatown,50,01-21-12,"I found there was a lot of improvement compared to the last time that we visited 2 years ago.Everything is good, our bill came to $60 and the both of us really enjoy it.The service is good, maybe because I can able to speak Mandarin to the ladies."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average only but authentic +,30,01-11-12,I can only compare this to the yum cha back home in Melbourne.I found this place upstairs in a street off Temple St in middle of Chinatown. Poorly signposted and had to ask local shopkeeper for directions.Came for lunch on weekday and there was a photo description menu rather than wheeled trollies which made it easy to order but less interesting.The yum cha was standard rather than inspiring. Tasty+ Would like to try Yum Cha elsewhere in Singapore before rushing back.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,dim sum at is best,50,01-08-12,"This is a dim sum heaven in the heart of Chinatown, during weekdays you have to order from the menu but during weekend waiters pass by from table to table with trolleys packed with bamboo buckets full of dim sum delicacies. A must try in Singapore and don't forget to eat your dim sum drinking only water and chinese tea for a very far east experience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Standards have dropped,20,12-31-11,"Had brunch here, restaurant was crowded, service was slow and rather apathetic. Dim sum was cold, overall standard of food has dropped. And do remember to check your final bill as they overcharged me by $15"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you are visiting Chinatown do stop and have some traditional dim sum,40,11-10-11,Excellent dim sum and traditional Chinese food at affordable prices in the heart of Chinatown. The wine is expensive and only sold by the bottle so stick to tea. Delicious food can't wait to go back.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Chow!,50,10-22-11,"we liked their crabs , shrimps..everything!!! the staff were also helpful in keeping my son's birthday cake while we wearing still having dinner"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very affordable and delicious dim sum,40,09-13-11,"Nestled in the heart of the Chinatown district, Yum Cha offers a delectable array of authentic Chinese cuisine. During a short vacation, a friend who lives in Singapore highly recommended this place. Me and my friend's family went here for some dim sum feast and we were not disappointed. The dim sums were great and we enjoyed every bite of what we ordered. I especially loved their siew mai, che cheong fun and xiao long fun. Restaurant ambiance was acceptable and the staff were accommodating."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good value for authentic Dim Sum,40,09-05-11,"We had lunch here on our second day in Singapore and it was a great experience - very authentic dishes for Dim Sum. The service is perhaps not as good as the food, but this tends to be the case in most Dim Sum restaurants.Best to arrive earlier on Sundays, to avoid the long wait at the entrance."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable Dim Sum in a pretty oriental ambience,50,08-28-11,"Visited there with my husband and daughter for lunch on Sunday afternoon. Although the restraunt was crowded and were so many people waiting, we were so lucky to get the seat soon because we were only three people, while the others were large parties. We seated at a table beside window with a pretty view of lanterns, but the window itself adds a oriental spice to the room. Of course the food were good: as were shown in the pictures, they look nice as well. We rushed to Pekin Duck, and had nine dim sum and oolong tea. What surprised us was that the total price was 56 Singapore dollars!!! Definitely visit there again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One manageress spoilt our dining experience.,30,07-30-11,"Dined here several times & had enjoyed most of the time except for this particular manageress, Madalene, who was rude to the core & deliberately pick a fight with customers.Without the ugly encounter with her, I would have rated this restauarant as ""Excellent"". Apparently, when we returned next round the management did nothing to her even after giving valuable feedbacks. Otherwise, i find the food 'great', waiting service by other staff 'good', ambience 'very spacious & high ceilings', price is on the high end. Would i go back, the ugly encounter is a phobia unless the management take actions on Madalene's rotten attitude."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A favourite place.,40,06-17-11,"Well, despite the place being busy and often a bit noisy we always enjoy this place when we go to Sing. The Dim Sum are good ,at times very good. with a wide choice. If you arent getting what you want then try a bit harder and be nice to the staff, they a generally rushed off their feet. Ordering rather than waiting for trolleys ensures you get served The main i.e. non dim sum menu is fine and the food is goood. Bargain dealls for early morning and afternoon. The best DS place in Sing, or KL for that matter."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service but delicious meal,30,07-17-10,"We went here on our last day in Singapore. We were staying in Chinatown and wanted something from a restaurant so we could sit down. Service was absolutely shocking.They use a button system where you push a button when you are ready to order, want more water or want the bill. Good luck getting them at any other time. And my waitress was very cranky and spoke no english whatsoever. But.... our meal was good. Sizzling beef and sweet and sour pork, rice and chinese tea came to around $45 sgd, not cheap for chinatown but the food was tasty. Pity about everything else though"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,It was better.,20,03-21-10,It was better.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,shocking,10,07-25-09,went to yum cha restaurant in singapore for the first time in ages for yum cha and was sooo dissapointed. the trolleys didn't even make the efforft to come to our table. we had to keep asking for more food. they weren't THAT busy...surely they would want to try to make more money???
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum Buffet a good way to experiment.,40,03-17-09,"Dim Sum @ Yum ChaHad a desire for some nice Dim Sum. Followed a recommendation and headed into the heart of China Town. A little hard to find, hidden away in the back streets between Smith and Temple Street, above a perfume shop.Had the DimSum Buffet at SD16.80++ per person. If you arent sure what you like, or want to try lots of different things, its a great idea. The waitresses bring round and offer you a variety of plates by hand or in a trolley, and you say yes or no. Because you pay a fixed price, it means you can try some new things without worrying about wasting money.Tip: the menu has a few categories of things that you order from your server, the rest is pot luck what is brought round. However, we found that if there was something on the general menu we particularly wanted, our server was happy to order it for us anyway.Left feeling very stuffed, and having tried some interesting things. We appeared to be the only non locals there, but that wasnt a problem in any way.(http://www.yumcha.com.sg/Contact.html)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,expensive.,30,01-12-09,expensive.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Will Not Try Again,20,10-25-08,Food wasn't the greatest. We've had more authentic dim sum in LA.Service was ok. The hostess needs some attitude adjustment.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Crab!,50,07-16-18,"I'm told this is the home of the original Chili Crab. Not sure if that's true, but it is delicious! The Black pepper crab is also great!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood,40,07-14-18,"Food is consistently well executed here. Black pepper crab is always a favourite - it’s not overly peppery and the crabs are always cooked well. The razor clams were delicious though it doesn’t come cheap. The sweet chilli crab is not the best for me as it has a strong tomato taste but others seems to enjoy that.Service wise, it always seems slightly haphazard."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very much one for the Locals but still a great experience for the ""out-of-Towners""",40,07-12-18,"Visited with a colleague who lives locally and was excited to see whether Long Beach at Dempsey was as good as their Restaurant on the East Coast Parkway Seafood Centre. I was not disappointed. The house special shell-off prawns were excellent, as was the black pepper crab. All in all, a very enjoyable evening at an incredibly busy restaurant. Efficient service and really good value."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food Good service!,50,07-10-18,I had a welcome dinner here with my company. The food was great. I really like the cereal prawn and bamboo clam. You better go there before 7 p.m. otherwise long q
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent service,40,06-30-18,"We had friends from the US, and brought them here for dinner. The chilli and black pepper crabs were quite good. We also ordered vegetarian fried bee hoon for one of their children who does not eat meat, as well as mee goreng, calamari, fried baby squid, and spinach with three eggs. All the dishes were generally tasty, though prices were pretty high as well.But it was the service that wowed us. As we had three children below 10 years dining in the group, the staff helped to deshell the black pepper crab. When one of the kids threw up, staff Lynn preferred some oil for her stomach, as well as extra plastic bags in case she threw up in the vehicle. Overall, the meal was good, and cost $400."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Black Pepper Crab but Mediocre Service,40,06-18-18,"We had a reservation and were seated quickly as requested outside. The setting of the restaurant is always beautiful in the evening. The food was excellent but the service was really not so good this time. Food came quickly but water refills, getting the bill, paying the bill etc was slow and cumbersome. We will return but hope the site management will address the service. Our previous visit was a 5 star.... and this had the potential to be as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Service was as good as the crab.,50,06-08-18,"Amazing service from when you first step into the restaurant. It's very busy so make reservations. We ordered the set menu for 2 that included crab AND razor clams (and more) for $168 SGD. The razor clams were fresh and garlicky, the crab was perfectly peppery and delicious. I would come back for sure."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wonderful Staff and Food,40,06-06-18,"Visited on a lunch time so the place wasn’t as busy! The manager and staff were wonderful! Great service! The food is also very Good! Chilli crab, razor clams and roast duck are all superb! The price is quite expensive but we can’t complain as the quality of food is really very high! It’s worth making a trip to Dempsey! Even with the abundance of choices it’s still worth choosing over the other Restaurants. Looking forward to going back soon."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chili Crab in town,50,06-01-18,It’s always my 1st choice for chili crabs for my VIP guests and family dinner. Food are delicious and price is reasonable.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chefs must be on leave ,20,05-29-18,"I have been a regular customer and bringing overseas guests there or the one at East Coast.Having eaten black pepper and chilli crabs, i decided to try something different; saltes egg cream. It was disastrous. I expect it to be creamy but instead it's dry. The crab meat was harden and shrunk as it was over fried. They even had the skin to charge more for the preparation. The roast duck was not completely cooked with raw bloody flesh at bone. We were told that a new sercing will be prepared but we were presented with a steamed roast duck that tasted like a overnight dish. The vegi dish was no better than a coffee shop zicar. My guess is that the chefs must be on leave that evening and all the dishes were prepared by trainees. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Singapore Crab,40,05-21-18,"Prepare to get messy!The crab is to die for, but you must eat by hand and thus endure some greasy hands. It is all worth it though!The sides are good s well, but the real attraction for sure is their crabs. The service is so and so, but very cozy and the laid back attitude actually seems to fit the place quite well and therefore is actually just right. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wow!!!!,50,05-18-18,"Long Beach was phenomenal. We had pepper crab, chili crab, shrimp, sea bass and scallops. Each were fantastic!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for its chilli & pepper crab,30,04-28-18,"We came here for supper at 11pm to try their famous chilli crab and black pepper crab. If flavour in both sauce are quite distinct:Black pepper crab- very strong pepper taste, so much so it is quick spicy with a very peppery after taste. And quite salty. It’s a dry “sauce”. Chilli crab- half the pot is the sauce/gravy. It a sweet/spicy chilli sauce.If you love the taste of the “sweetness” of crabs on its own. Unfortunately for you, the sauces are very overpowering and kills the taste of the crab. But if you do not like crabs, you will actually enjoy them for a change because the sauce kills the taste of the crab.This is the only place in Singapore that I have tried the chilli crabs so I have nothing to compare. But having love to eat crabs, it is not to my liking. Apparently the place can get quite busy during peak hours (aka dinner). We came at 11pm, so it was a lot quieter and hence our dishes came out within 10mins. Usually it would take 30mins when it is really busy. Our waitress (the Phillipino lady) who took our order was wonderful and friendly. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not our way of eating crab ? ,30,04-28-18,"Located in Dempsey Hill just opposite the Botanical garden . Good atmosphere . Indoor and outdoor seating Service staffs are friendly and efficient . Even though she warn us the crab will take 30 minutes to cook we got the dishes at 15 min but then again we went at 10.30 pm Black pepper crab was charged at $88 kilo . It has overpowering peppery taste and very salty . Chillie crab was charged same at $88 per kilo . It has sweet sauce with touch of lemongrass , onion garlic and lemon . Nice sauce to go with dumpling Frankly the peppery and chillie sauce killed the sweet taste of crab "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty Chilli Crab,50,04-26-18,"If you don’t make it out to East Coast then Long Beach restaurant in the Dempsey area is a great place to get your fix of chilli crabs. Best to book in advance, the place gets very busy. Last order is 12:30am every evening."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Busy Restaurant famed for its seafood - Staff stressed!,30,04-25-18,I ate here with a colleague as was told it was the best pepper Crab in Singapore. the restaurant is very busy and staff looked stressed. We had booked a table but still had to stand in a queue to get a table. No eye contact from the receptionist and staff were mostly unhelpful. they need to work on customer service. The Pepper Crab was good but not up to House of Crab in Colombo.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great crab and superb service. ,50,04-23-18,"Went one night for the famous chilli and black pepper crabs which didn’t disappoint, in fact all the food we had was fresh and tasted great. Beautiful House Speciality Prawns, the freshest buns (I could have eaten them all) with the crab, crunchy vegetables and perfectly cooked rice. I also want to pay particular homage to Lynn our waitress, she made our night, so special, we will never forget you Lynn! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious black pepper & chilli crabs!,50,04-06-18,"What a fantastic experience! Loved each and every single item. Absolutely succulent black pepper and chili crabs! It was just perfect! The fried calsmari, garlic prawns and the oh so delicious fried buns were just out of this world. Quick customer service. Price on the higher end which is definitely worth it. Its a clean and chilled out environment. Just one observation- charging for the napkins was a little cheap i thought. But its their place. So didnt care. Definitely going back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Horrible experience,10,03-28-18,"Just finished dinner at Long Beach Dempsey with my brother and his family who are visiting from out of town — and I will never go back there again! Although I made a reservation for 730pm, we had to wait for a table and we weren’t seated until almost 8pm. The food was mediocre at best. The razor clams were overcooked (and overpriced) with more minced garlic than clams. The house specially prawns were disappointing as were the house specialty tofu. However the worst part of the experience was that our Chili crab (the main reason we were there in the first place) never showed up! We had finished all the other dishes and waited over 30min. We reminded a wait staff, then after a while reminded another. We were then told the kitchen dropped one of the crab claws and had to prepare a new dish! Whilst the wait staff tried their best, they were clearly overworked, understaffed and not trained for any ‘service recovery.’ I will not be going back there again! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just ok,30,03-28-18,"Just an ok experience - didn't have a record of our reservation when we arrived, seated us at a table that was essentially in a stair well, and food was just ok. Deep fried baby octopus was not good, will be going to Jumbo for those in future. Pepper crab and chili crab good, noodles just ok. Disappointing experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab,40,03-24-18,"Come here everytime for its black pepper crab. I notice most other ppl ordered the chili crab, but for me black pepper is preferable. Place is always crowded, even on monday night. Reservation is a must if u want to sit indoors. Not a suitable place for dates imho"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No wifi,10,03-19-18,Not a kid friendly place. Not willing to share their wifi with customers so my kid can play some games and keep himself occupied. Disappointing!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ideal for guests ,40,03-16-18,"Good seafood, view and environment. Ideal place if you have guests especially from abroad to try out Singapore black pepper crab. The service here is excellent, very attentive to customers.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very crowded place and food was so-so,30,03-09-18,"Was brought here by a local friend who swears by the Alaskan crab here. The Alaskan crab was good (though very expensive) but the rest of the dishes were a complete let-down. Food in Malaysia is better (and cheaper!!). Sprawling place with lots of rooms around and it just had a strange atmosphere. It was very crowded but it just felt a bit claustrophobic rather than lively, and service was very hit and miss. If you're stuck in one of the rooms at the back (which we were), then you sometimes had to go out to get the waitstaff to refill your tea as they don't come by other than to serve your food. I wouldn't recommend it. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Went for a birthday celebration. The staff made it a memorable celebration!,50,03-04-18,Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday. The food was great as always. Love the pepper crab. The service was amazing. They came out made my sister wear a tiara and sang happy birthday as we were cutting the cake. The whole restaurant began singing along too. Amazing experience
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent value for money,50,02-21-18,"Long Beach Dempsey is a wonderful restaurant, and it’s very accessible. The food is fantastic, and given that some Singapore restaurants can be expensive, I think this is moderately priced relative to the quality and service they deliver. I’ll be going back on my next visit to Singapore. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fantastic experience with Razor Clams, Black Pepper Crab and Sea Bass Penang style",50,02-20-18,"I can't say we are easily impressed with food, but today the food was wonderful, different flavors, spicy, but not too spicy, and very well seasoned. The Black Pepper Crab (S$ 71) is what they are known for and for a good reason, but the razor clams (S$ 16/each) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass Penang style (S$ 41)! Also the fried rice with dried scollops (S$ 18) was light and very good texture. Even the Spinach with Oyster Sauce (S$ 18) was very tasty. Of course a glass of Tiger draft (S$ 6.90) helped to cool the spice :).When eating the Black Pepper Crab, ask for gloves and a pick, as well as a bib to keep from splattering on your clothes! It comes out piping hot.Service was very good, and afterward we asked for a cab, which they called for, and it was here in less than 5 minutes.Definitely, for first timers to Singapore, and most experience dinner."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy CNY set menu,50,02-12-18,"I normally am not a fan of set menu as I like to mix and match my own. I can’t tonight because it is their busiest time of the year hence everyone has to choose a set of dinner from their menu. We chose the SGD348+++ menu and I must say surprisingly we all enjoy our meal very much!!! The food is fresh, well cooked and simply delicious. The dessert is fantastic, grapefruit coconut pudding with fresh mango. Their service despite a full house is impeccable. They change our plate after serving one dish and keep checking on us if we need anything. We will definitely go back again. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very good food,40,01-31-18,"The restaurant is not fancy in terms of look, as it is quite simple and not super cosy.Nevertheless the welcome and service is really nice, waiters and waitress are taking care of their customers with attention.The food was delicious, we had sevr’earl plates to share and all of them were tasty. Super fresh seafood, you can trust the place! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,50,01-23-18,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private rooms and plenty of seats for outside dining . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always good,40,01-13-18,"It was the second time in a week we decided to go for chilli and pepper crab. We went to Holy Crab in Bugis area and was disappointed. Maybe it’s because we always wanted the original taste. So this time, we decided Long Beach since it’s always good. We ordered both pepper and chilli crab and thought they had changed the recipe for the chilli crab as it tasted different. In the end we realized that we were served Thai style chilli crab. For those who are craving for the original chilli crab, please make sure you order the right thing bec they assume you want their most popular Thai style chilli crab. I guess we will have to go back another time to have the original one we have been craving for."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood restaurant ,40,01-08-18,"We ordered set menu. Quantity was good enough for four pax. Black pepper crab was very nice. and bamboo clam is also delicious.
My family enjoyed good food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must if just for the black pepper crab!,40,12-26-17,To be honest this is our go to destination in Singapore for black pepper crab...it is truly delicious and in fact that’s all we have except for Tiger Beer on tap! Park right out the front and Ideally go next door to Red Dot (see photo) to have a brew or a cocktail first. Sit at a table the garden and listen to the birds - it’s rustic and we love it and we were treated to an approaching thunderstorm yesterday without the rain...bliss.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper crab,30,12-14-17,"We were told by locals to go and try black pepper crab at this restaurant. We did. The service was good. They even took out the meat from the crab for you. However the most important thing about food is the ingredients. The crab is not great at all. They give you mud crabs which are tasteless. Therefore black pepper, which you can order for hotter or less hot, is the only taste you get from this dish. And the razor cram was overcooked. So all in all the lunch was not so good as expected and it was expensive too. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Chilli Crab!,50,12-10-17,"Great food, especially the chilli crab with mantou. We ordered another serving! Also the fresh baby sotong with chilli and lime, and the signature prawn dish. All in all, a satisfying meal and friendly service too!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Really like Dempsey. Good food & service,40,12-05-17,We were brought here by a local contact & I will make sure I plan a night in this area next time I come back to Singapore. I love how they’ve reused the old British Army Barracks for restaurants & bars. The food here was good & service was excellent. The chilli crab tasted great although you’ve got to enjoy spicy food to manage it
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice dinner with friends!,40,12-03-17,We went for the pepper crabs and your can bring your own wine there for a small corkage charge. We had steamed prawns along with a fresh fried fish. Service is friendly and very good. One of our favorite seafood restaurants that has lasted through time. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good crab, but quite pricey",40,11-19-17,"Service was really good! The food was good as well, but quite overpriced in my opinion. Worth a visit when you’re in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs,50,11-09-17,The best pepper crabs in Singapore. We also had the wasabi prawns and Kayla which were superb. A must visit in Singapore
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"For occasions, occasinally",40,11-07-17,"Iconic food does not come cheap in Singapore. At least not crab and seafood.But if you must try crab done Sg style, then there's only Long Beach and Jumbo, cos these are the two popular places to try crab. Some may also include No Signboard and Eng Seng, or some zichar palace at your HDB void deck. But really, when it comes to iconic and signature, only Long Beach and Jumbo should be considered, for tourists and guests from overseas. (cos if you're trublu local, you will either diy at home, which is not difficult; or you will know of some joint somewhere offering cheaper, and perhaps better alternatives)."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Iconic sea food in Singapore,40,10-28-17,"Iconic and classic seafood place in Singapore. Claims to be there creator of the black pepper chili crab. Thing is I don't eat sea food but judging by my colleagues, they loved it. Quick service."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not bad,30,10-21-17,"Came here on our last night in Singapore. We wanted to try their black pepper crab. They have a few set banquet which of course all feature either black pepper or chili crab. We've picked one with razor clams (was excellent) and lala rice noodle (I've read that's good). There were quite a few tables around us but somehow everyone's food came before we did.The waitress did warn us that the normal crabs they had at the time were a bit small so was expected that. However, we were a bit disappointed with the black pepper crab. Didn't find the taste that great.We then ordered another type of crab (Scottish wild crab) and cooked it with chili, this dish was excellent. The crab was sweet and the chili sauce was very fragrant. Perfect to dish the fried buns in.The meal was not cheap but at least we had a few good dishes."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Alaska Crab / Best in town,50,10-20-17,"Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is now having their Alaska Crab yearly promotion in Oct 2017. I had two times already and going to have another 2 rounds next week. This round the promotion has to order a set course for min 4 people. It is good though because we can also enjoy other seafood such as prawn, fish and bamboo clams etc. Why so many times in a month? simply because they have the best Alaska crab in town esp. price is reasonable at SGD88 per kg - 50% compared normal price. You can choose to have white pepper or chilly or 2 flavors separately. My favorite is white pepper flavor. Lastly, Long Beach has the best Restaurant manager called Priscilla. She provides excellent service to me and my guests. We feel like eating at home. Well done Priscilla. Tip: you can upsize with additional cost and it is worth to do that because the bigger the size the better the crab meat. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE BEST BLACK PEPPER CRAB EVER,40,10-20-17,"Arranged by our hotel,very busy Saturday night,We sat outside and enjoyed the cooler weather.Due to the very busy night service was a bit slow but understandable . We sat on a couple of beers and watched the action.We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and side dishes and were not disappointed when they arrived. A Large crab with the most magnificent pepper flavour I have tasted plenty of meat and rice."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average for Singapore but a little pricy,30,10-15-17,"Food was fine in my opinion standard fare for Singapore and 8 of us eating but still hurt a bit when I picked up the bill. Charging for the wet towels was cheeky considering gwe ordered and paid for prawns and two crab. Tried to order the crispy duck but a CA's eof sorry sold out which is also a fail in my book. If passing would probably go back but wouldn't bother to make the trip from downtown again, food from a hawker centre as good or better. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR NAPKINS,10,10-12-17,lol what a joke. You have to pay for the wet napkins that they give you. Crab is messy what do they expect you to do? Use the table cloths?? My boyfriend and I got a bad first impression since they were pushing the most expensive items on us and rushing us to order we should have known better. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great spot for Singaporean style seafood,40,10-04-17,"This place is really casual outdoors (plastic tables on the veranda) but it's a nice spot and very green. There are also indoor tables and private dining rooms that are slightly less casual. The food is standard Singaporean seafood fare, but well done. Quality is excellent. My pet peeve is they can never bring all the food at once even when I ask, they instead bring it when it's ready. The service is average as expected in Singapore. As previous reviewers mention, you'll be charged for everything you touch so if you don't want to pay for the peanuts, don't eat them. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ok ,30,10-04-17,"Not a bad place if you want to enjoy Chinese seafood in Singapore . This place is very popular with tourists, locals and a favorite place to entertain business visitors to Singapore. Overrated.Pricey, but so is everything else in Singapore. There are many other places equally good if not better and cheaper."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Birthday celebration,50,10-04-17,"Have not been here for many years. Husband reminded me of it so I booked a table for a Saturday dinner.We were promptly greeted at the entrance. As we booked for an early time slot, restaurant was quite empty at that time.The staff took our orders very quickly and made good suggestions on what we could order. My son was eager to eat the famous Singapore chili crab with mantou, a kind of fried bun. Supposed to dip buns in the crab gravy, really yummy stuff!We also ordered fried baby squid, prawn fritters, beef rice noodles, fried rice, venison, etc. Food standard is still high compared to last time. The only downside of the restaurant is no sheltered car park. It was drizzling when we reached there so had to look for brollies in the car. Overall it was an enjoyable experience dining at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant as staff were attentive and food was good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Long Beach, Long Wait",40,09-24-17,"I can't complain about food quality. One of the best tasting Chinese seafood restaurants out there. No wonder it is always included in the search results of top 10 chili crab in Singapore.I recommend the following dishes: black pepper crab, crispy baby squid, steam grouper in Hong Kong style soy sauce, roast chicken and baby kailan. These were paired with fried rice with tiny fried silver fish. Really nice fresh taste of the steamed fish and nice juicy tender roast chicken.I also can't complain about the individual service of the waiters. Courteous, and attentive. They knew what to do and they were a pleasure to talk to and ask recommendations about the food.However, the kitchen just couldn't cope with the full house of diners. Our food was served one dish at a time. Delivery was much too delayed. Lastly, the steamed grouper came 20 mins after the first item was placed on the table. Diners cannot enjoy their meal if the dishes are served piecemeal.Would have rated this resto 5 stars."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Pepper and Chili Crab - Charged for the Towelettes and Everything Else,40,09-22-17,"I have eaten at Long Beach before and wanted to have the crabs on this trip too. I ordered a pepper and a chili crab, and some baby kailin. I was charged S$2.00 for the peanuts that they brought to the table, S$1.80 for the rolls and S$0.60 for the towelettes. In the grand scheme of things not a big deal from a monetary perspective, but on a S$200 tab, give me a break. I guess that's how they stay in business and maintain margins, but it is irksome to see on the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazingly fresh and succulent (So Impressed),50,09-21-17,"Long Beach @ DEMPSEY Located at 25 Dempsey Road. There are many famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore, but Long Beach has to be the top ONE. I make it a point when I have visitors or friends visiting Singapore to take them to Long Beach for there more famous Singapore Chili Crab and black pepper crab and off course for the other scrumptious seafood on offer. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,50,09-14-17,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private room and plenty of seats outside . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood,40,09-13-17,The food is OK. Average seafood. No choice for vegetarians. The staffs are nice and the service is good. A bit pricey. Went for CNY celebration lunch
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Overrated - you can find better for less,30,09-13-17,"Our friends had gone here and recommended it and so we booked through the concierge at our hotel who told us it was upscale casual. It's casual casual with slippers and t-shirts. It's the kind of restaurant that they place food on your table that you haven't ordered and will charge you for it unless you say something. We ordered the chilli crab, med order of prawns, med order of noodles, vegetables and 4 beers and it came to $240 singapore dollars. There is however a restaurant 5 minutes walk away called the Red Dot that has great live music and a good vibe!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The place for your seafood fix,50,09-09-17,"We just finished a family dinner here in one of their private rooms, served by a very attentive captain who even took our pepper crab claws away to de-shell for us. For big parties (9 of us), their set menus offer good value, as their a la carte prices are on the high side. The price worked out to about $100/head (including drinks of beer and juice), which by Singapore standards is pretty acceptable for a meal in a good setting of quality dishes comprising the freshest of seafood. The menu comprised lobster, crab, steamed fish, duck, scallops with asparagus, noodles and a dessert. Their seafood dishes were indisputably excellent, to be expected of a restaurant that has built its reputation on seafood. The surprise item that we all wow-ed over were the noodles, cooked in an exquisite duck broth flavoured with cabbage leaves and pumpkin. You leave the restaurant feeling good not just with the food but at the way the restaurant staff have all been trained to thank departing guests as they make their way out, making you feel that you have been a most welcome guest."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh seafood with good recipe,50,09-04-17,"I probably went more to East Coast for seafood but never try it in Dempsey Hill before. The whole place is different from the city centre but full of reminiscences of the colonial times. The first dish of deep fried lobster is so fresh that surprised all of us. Unlike the traditional Cantonese way of preparing seafood, there is always a different spice of south east origin in every dish. Same goes to the pepper crab, fish and others. At the end, there is the noodle with blue swimmer crab. It is so delicious to end of the dinner."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Be prepaid to pay but excellent food,50,08-27-17,"The meal is bound to be expensive so it's not for those trying to preserve their wallets. However, the food here is really pretty good, especially their seafood choices. Recommended is the chili sauce lala and black pepper crab. Enjoy!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,An Amazing Institution,50,08-22-17,"If you like seafood, this is the place to go to, but make sure to wear a colourful shirt, because it is all about eating with hands... Aprons are available for those who want one. The Pepper Crab and Child Crab are truly excellent dishes, when ordering ask the staff to crack the shells for you if you want to avoid doing this yourself... The crabs are massive, but If you want the really big crabs, order them in advance to avoid disappointment as they sell VERY quickly. The Razor Clams are also excellent as are the prawns and generally other seafood dishes. Great to go in a group and order plenty of beer by the pitcher. The staff are great, friendly and happy to provide fast, efficient service. What a great time we had... One small negative point, catching taxi's from the restaurant is not as easy as you would expect... but gives you a chance to walk off the excellent food you have indulged in!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing food in a colonial setting ,40,08-20-17,"I usually go to the Long Beach UDMC restaurant so my expectations were high. The food didn't disappoint me, the black pepper crabs were amazing. Whilst waiting for friends to arrive, we had the white bait coated in 7 spices with our beer which was also excellent. Dinner was quite expensive though, S$115 per person.Restaurant is in an old military colonial building and we sat outside on the veranda under a ceiling fan. It was nice but given the choice, I would prefer to be eating by the sea in the East Coast Park.However after dinner, it is possible to visit the Red Dot microbrewery, which is next door."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Overpriced,30,08-14-17,"Extremely expensive meal. They were full indoors so we had to seat outdoors, but it was extremely hot and stuffy. We did not enjoy the dining experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but delicious,40,08-09-17,The pork ribs are phenomenal! The food is generally nice but a bit on the pricey side. Try to get seating indoors as it can get rather hot and humid outside
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family Birthday Celebration,40,08-07-17,Our family's favourite haunt for good seafood. We like most of the dishes especially the black pepper crab and Lala Horfun. It has free parking but remember to make reservations because it is always fully booked. Private rooms are available if you spend above a certain amount. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dinner with colleagues - pepper/chili crab,40,08-05-17,Had an excellent dinner with four outside and of course enjoyed the pepper/chili crab as main dishes! Also ordered the bamboo scallops which also tasted excellent. And all with great Erdinger hefe weizen. A recommender!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Still very good,40,07-20-17,"It is a must go for the pepper and chili crab! Razor clams with garlic sauce very good. The drunken are also perfectVery casual atmosphere. Do not go with white clothes as it is not compatible with the crab sauces! Only down side no wine selection. Only cocktail beer or sake Reasonable prices. Cheaper than Newton Circle paid 160$S for one pepper crab, one chili crab, 4 razor clams, some vegetable , two bols of rice , one coconut and one beer"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,good place for a big group,40,07-14-17,"enjoyed the pepper crab, spicy crab, lobster and a plethora of other dishes. Atmosphere was festive, with Chinese-style private dining rooms. More a casual, big group place for celebrations than a place to take your sweetheart for a romantic dinner. If she wants a beer, a bib, and a big crab... then take her :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE PLACE for pepper crab,50,07-12-17,Spendy - 258 SGD for a family of 4 - but a classic place for pepper crab and chili crab. A great atmosphere. You can sit inside or out. In a rustic setting. Highly recommended.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,This place is absolutely fantastic ,50,06-30-17,If seafood is your delight you will be well pleased with the Chilli Crab served at this Resteraunt because they are amazing and served by a very friendly staff The place is ideally located on the coast which at night is particularly spectacular by the ships waiting to dock in the background We had been there in 2009 and it was every bit as good in 2017 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,worth-going for crab fans!,40,06-28-17,"this was one of the best crab place in Singapore.we visited the place for dinner at 8:30pm, but was told big size crabs were all gone. I strongly suggested those looking for big crabs to call and reserve crabs in advance.We ended up ordering 2 small ones (each $55), trying pepper ad chili taste.The pepper one was great but it was less spicy than expected. much appreciated the smell and taste of the dish.The chili one was nice too, but the sauce was slightly more spicy than the other crab restaurant's recipe.service was good and attentive.we were offered aprons and help on cracking the shell when it was a bit difficult to crack the thick shell. Tho the kitchen did cracked on the shell to prepare it for eating before serving (a nice gesture).in terms of price, this place may be slightly more expensive, in a 10% range, comparing to other crab place.but the decent seating environment and the service were all well-justified."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,How good!!,40,06-24-17,Had a group dinner on the recommendation of a co-worker so wasn't sure what to expect but it came thru. The debate of chili vs black pepper crab continued on to the next day. (Both good but black pepper was outstanding in my view). Other menu items were very good as well so something for everyone. Service was attentive and everyone had a good time. Definitely worth the trip. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, very friendly service",50,06-21-17,"The food was very tasty. We were a gathering of 20 and had a private room. The service staff were attentive...from the minute we entered the restaurant (all the staff greeted us along the way to the room!!!) Its a little expensive, but the quality was excellent!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top seafood,40,06-17-17,"This place is crazily busy which must mean it is doing something right. The seafood is as fresh as possible. Great variety available at different prices which can reach stratospheric levels if you are not careful. The house special of pepper and salt prawns was absolutely delicious with plump juicy prawns that burst in the mouth. We shared a number of different dishes as one does in Asian restaurants and all were tasty. The service was pretty chaotic and their habit of bringing out dishes one at a time is most disconcerting for group sharing. Curiously they supply tiny paper serviettes which are practically useless, which struck me as bizarre in a.place of quality food. Nevertheless the place was packed on Friday night."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must try chili crab,50,06-16-17,Have been there several times but the chilli crab always have been the tastiest and never disappointed us. Portion can be big but the friendly waiter always advises you what is best.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best black pepper crab. ,50,06-04-17,This very busy seafood restaurant in Dempsey Singapore does the best black pepper crab as well as the better known Chilli crab. Also try to the razor clams in garlic. Best to book as this is really popular. Stays open past midnight.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Finger Licking Food,50,06-02-17,We had the chill crab and the pepper crab and sweet and sour fish and all three dishes we amazingly nice and their bread was amazing to dip in the sauces. Price is high but so is everything else in Singapore. We paid almost S$350 for the above plush a rice dis and a green dish plus a jug of beer. Overall worth the experience
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to eat fresh and delicious seafood in Singapore ,50,06-01-17," The place is unique in a very nice area in Singapore.When visiting Singapore I always eat there. Food is consistently great. Seafood is always fresh from the tanks in the restaurant - in case wanted, you can feel and touch the food prior to cooking.Place is due to it's performance always full - so I highly recommended to book a table in advance"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty,50,05-30-17,Extensive menu and delicious food. The crab is a must have both spicy and delicious. It also serves frogs legs. The only negative is that some of the dishes and even the drinks took some time to come. The staff is very friendly and quite helpful. And reasonable pricing.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious,50,05-29-17,Chili crab was delicious! Order with fried bread buns and asparagus . Great seafood menu. Not a place for non seafood eaters. Excellent fresh baby coconut
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Too much MSG,10,05-24-17,"Very long wait for the order.Too much MSG in the cooking.We came as a party of 12, waited for over 45mins for the 1st dish. The dishes came 1 by 1 and 2 dishes we ordered were not available , also they ran out of fresh coconuts.Either to say we were very disappointed by the whole experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,a night out with friends,50,05-21-17,Good seafood and a decent option for vegetarian. Friendly service and interesting set menus available at reasonable price
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Most delicious crab,40,05-16-17,"Had one of the most delicious pepper crab ever. Spicy and delicious. As I was on a business meeting, we were seated with a group in a private box and that helps keeping conversations inside. Beer was served by the Tiger team! Had a 'smoking' good desert afterwards as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Mother's day celebration,50,05-13-17,We are seated with a cozy corner which has a nice garden view. Food is all good. Baby squid is crispy with dash of sweet sauce. Assorted mushroom with sio pek chye is unique with the taste. Not to say the lala hor fun is its house signature. The crab of course is the most fantastic dish. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic Seafood - relaxing location,50,05-05-17,"The service is excellent here. It was our first time eating Chili Crab and some other unusual (for an American) seafood, and everyone was helpful. I prefer the pepper crab to the chili crab (a lot less messy), but both great. I think next time I will ask for pepper crab with a side of the chili sauce to dunk it in."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long beach Authentic Pepper Crab,30,05-04-17,Went to Long Beach for Chili crab with a group of 6 friends. The food was good but despite our best efforts the language barrier worked as a disadvantage. We asked several times how many crabs we would get and never were able to understand the answer. Food came out very slowly and one dish at a time to be split between 6 of us. When the crab finally came it was maybe one to 2 crabs torn up in a very soupy stew. Very much wok for very little crab meat. Communication was never adequate and we were stuck entertaining our friends as per how the restaurant wanted to serve us. We had to ask several times for napkins. Not Singapore's best. No offer of bread or rice was ever made / to enjoy the gravy with. But the Tiger Beer women come by frequently.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,You have to have the chilli crab!,50,04-30-17,"Chilli Crab is the national dish of Singapore, and I know why - its fantastic.I can highly recommend Long Beach @ Dempsey as ""the place"" to get your fix of this soul food in Singapore.The starter courses are great, but don't fill up on them. Move right along to the main attraction. Although its called chilli crab, its not really that hot or spicy.The chilli crab is served with its shell pre-cracked so there is no need to use the nut crackers supplied - go for the claw which contains the best meat, but don't be shy to use the fried sweet buns supplied as a side dish to soak up the sauce. Chilli Crab: 94.00 Singapore Dollars - a bit pricy, but well worth the experience.We did not have space for the pepper crab, but there will definitely be a next time."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good crab but duck was not good,40,04-29-17,"We ordered the black pepper crab, it was a bit spicy but it taste good. The duck was very dry and it looks like left over food from yesterday. Taste awful."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chili Crab experience with friends,50,04-24-17,Chili Crabs by the sea in Singapore! We had both the pepper seasoning and the red sauce. I liked the red sauce with the rolls best. My husband liked the pepper version so we were glad we ordered both. We were glad we wore the bibs because this is a messy experience! You have to work for your food. Wear clothes you intend to wash afterwards.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at reasonable prices!,40,04-20-17,"Brought an overseas visitor here for dinner and he liked the cozy and green location. We ordered black pepper and chilli crabs + fried mantou . We absolutely loved the black pepper crabs and finished these in record time, so we ordered a second plate. The chill crab paled in comparison although it went well with the mantou. I found the chilli crab on the sweet side and too gooey. The steam prawns were fresh and sweet and the fried kailan done to perfection. Overall, a very good enjoyable meal at reasonable prices."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love this location -- delicious food,50,04-18-17,"I love love love the food here. I used to come here when I was a student studying abroad in Singapore in 2009. I just returned for a trip with my husband and friends and was delighted to see (and taste) that the quality of the food remained the same. Great for large groups! Try the Singapore chili crab (make sure to get the bread to dip in the sauce) and the white pepper crab. If your group is large enough, order the garlic mussels and the black pepper crab as well. It's a short distance from the downtown area, but it's easy to get to with a cab or Uber. Highly recommend!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Another Great Meal,50,04-16-17,"We had family Easter lunch at Long Beach and it was another great meal. Food was very good - chilli crab was not too sweet with a nice bite, cereal prawns excellent, crispy squid a must. Service was excellent and Toni who served our table would be one of the best I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much effort and all with a wonderful smile. Well done!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great outdoor dining on local seafood specialties,40,04-08-17,We went in a group and were seated outside. Very nice. The food was typical and very tasty. Service was very good.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family lunch ,40,04-08-17,I craved Singapore based pepper crab and went here straight from the airport. While the staff were attentive the place definitely had a worn down vibe and a bit touristy without the benefits...a bit pricey and the food was ultimately serviceable but nothing grand to write home about. Go if you are hungry and in the neighborhood but don't make the effort to go if out of the way.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very good food, service and atmosphere ",50,04-05-17,"10 people group in a room and a round table. We ordered many dishes including: Bamboo clams, chili crab and black pepper crab. With many other dishes. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The privacy that room gave us really helped the great atmosphere and we were able to enjoy each other company and the food. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent black pepper crab and cereal lobster!,40,03-23-17,"Our group decided on seafood dining for our get together and the default recommenation was Long Beach, particularly the one in Dempsey due convenience in parking. I was treated to a great dinner of grilled squid with thick sesame topped sauce (really tender), an enoki mushroom dish, fried rice, a most flavorful black pepper crab which was tasty down to the last morsel and cereal canadian lobster which was sweet and meaty. What made our dinner more pleasant was the most efficient, friendly and courteous wait staff. Commendation for Ted, a cheerful young man who was all over the place helping the tables be served their seafood specialties. The place was packed - inside and out and was told this is normal in this restaurant. Dempseys is about 10 minutes from Orchard Rd, reachable only by taxi/car. The nearest MRT stations (Farrar Rd is one) can be quite a walk."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Chili and Black Pepper Crab with history,50,03-19-17,"Pros- Best black pepper crab for the money- Food overall is great for the price- Beer is cold and perfect after a long day in the Singapore heat- The restaurant sits on an old British military barracks, so the look and feel is original for the island and the entire shopping area sits on a hillConsiderations- Price: Like any place that serves these massive crustacean delights, be ready to pay around $90-100 SGD ($64-70 USD) for one- Location: It's a little off the beaten path, but still super clean, friendly, and where all of the locals eat- Reservations: Make a reservation if you can, because the place can be in full swing on a Friday/Saturday evening."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Seafood,50,03-11-17,"The best quality seafood I've ever eaten. This is a seafood lovers paradise. So much to choose from and always great quality. I can't go past the chilli or black pepper crab. A messy, finger licking feast of the best quality crab you will find. Squid, prawns, its all so good. Much pricier than your hawker food, but if your budget can manage it, give yourself a treat."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Seafood I've eaten in a long time,50,03-05-17,"Long Beach Dempsey has got to be one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long, long time. It's very much a 'get your hands dirty and stuck in' kind of place. We started with their signature black pepper crab and it was a real treat. Succulent, steaming hot and with just the right amount of spice!We also had the bean curd with chef's sauce, crispy duck, grouper, and durian pudding amongst other things. All of them a delight. The waitron staff are attentive and ensure that your Tiger Beer pitchers are never empty. A wonderful culinary experience. No wonder it's considered a Singapore institution. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,chili crab and more,40,03-02-17,"authentic restaurant for great seafood. Famous for Chili crab, but also the lobster and the other dishes were great. Service efficient and friendly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood, well priced",40,03-01-17,Went here with a large group (20) and the venue and service were perfect for the occasion. One of our local Singaporean friends ordered a banquet and the food was all really tasty. Chilli crab was pretty good but lacking on the chilli front. Beer was Ice cold.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chili Crab was delicious,40,02-28-17,"Went there with business friends for dinner, The Chili Crab was delicious, the other choice also good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average Chinese meal,30,02-27-17,Lacks a bit of flavour. Good wasabi prawns. Chillie Crab was average have eaten better. Razor clams were good. Good tea.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best chilli and pepper crab everrr,50,02-23-17,Just get the pepper and chilli crab and fried or steamed buns.... yum. My husband and I finished 2 crabs (about $75 each) it was a big meal but worth the tummy stretch!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always a pleasure ,50,02-18-17,"Every time I'm in Singapore ,we go out with business friends to LB food is excellent ,pepper crab and lots of other choices. We always sit outside and enjoy the warm evening air ,especially for us Germans in our wintertime ;)This time I forgot my bag at the restaurant and only realized it when I was back my hotel. We have called the management and the manager Priscilla was so kind to grab the bag and stored it until I came for pickup.Awesome !... Tx so much !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,awesome choice of restaurant especially if you have guest from overseas.. pricey but damn good!!,50,02-14-17,"my favourite is the lobster cook 3 ways, black pepper and white pepper crab and order the chilli crab sauce by the side to dip with their special buns.. also the kampong mee goreng.. a must go place when i have client from overseas!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,First dinner in Singapore,40,02-14-17,"My father and I met up with a friend of ours while visiting Singapore on vacation. His friend suggested Long Beach so we could try authentic Chili Crab and it was delicious! We struggled a bit with the lack of napkins because of how messy the food was, but eventually one of our servers sensed our despair and showed us the nearby cleaning stations. Thank god! Bibs are a must there so make sure to ask for one and extra wet wipes if need be "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good,40,02-08-17,We ordered chilli crab with mantou it was great. For the fish it was supposed to be steamed grouper but we asked for fried fish with sauce n it turned out not too good thou. The service is good and staffs are very friendly. It's better to call for reservation before you come to the restaurant as it's often full house. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood,40,01-27-17,"We had the set for 5 people, which included lobster cooked in white jade - so delicious, to die for. Crab in spicy tomato base is very delicious and we love the kampong noodles and the dessert is so impressive when carried out with the dry ice"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Two meals in 4 days! ,50,01-16-17,My absolute favourite and a must! I crave for their food and we went twice in 4 days for dinner! Excellent as always!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Food and Really good service,40,01-14-17,"This was my second visit to this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Friendly staff and very good food. Their Pepper crabs are quite nice and worth the money.
Will be returning on my next trip!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing black pepper crab!,50,01-08-17,"The restaurant is pretty large in size with indoor and outdoor seating.
The black pepper crab was simply amazing. A must have if you are in Singapore.
The service is also very good.
Would love to visit again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must have,50,01-04-17,Was taken to this restaurant by a fellow colleague. The food was amazing everything served was cooked perfectly everyone 7 out 7 did not have a dish they did not like. There crab is one of the best dishes to recommend. Will return to this restaurant again next time I come to singapore. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's always been my fave chilli crab place!,40,01-02-17,"I always go there every time I go to singapore just to eat their Chilli Crab, Mantou and bamboo clams! And yesterday, 1st Of Jan 2017 we had their set menu, everything was good except the fish, it's soso. The beehoon with clam is so goood, tastes like homecooked food. :) the price is also ok :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Casual Seafood place ,40,01-02-17,"Very nice casual seafood restaurant with outside seating on the terrace. Dempsey Hill is a trendy part of Singapore with some pretty colonial style bungalows. The restaurant serves great Singaporean (mostly Chinese) dishes with an emphasis on fish and seafood. Must try's are the black pepper crab, the steamed grouper in herbs. The atmosphere is casual and the staff very professional. A good choice for a relaxed meal in a leafy green outdoor setting. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chili Crab,40,12-26-16,There are more famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore but I like Long Beach for an overall great Chili Crab night out. I love the Chili Crab and fried bread with a few frosty Tigers. It's also convenient from Orchard Road and has plenty of parking. I've taken a lot of visitors to Long Beach and it's always been good.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper and Chilli Crab in Singapore,50,12-26-16,We make it a point to go once on every trip to Singapore. We were 6 so we ordered both the Black Pepper and the Chilli Crabs. I loved the Chilli but my son and daughter in law loved the Black Pepper. Hint: Your waiter will remove the meat from the shell if asked. (highly recommended) We all agreed the Royal Razor Clams with Garlic were spectacular for a starter and of course we had Fried Buns (to lap up the chilli sauce) Fried Noodles were perfect and the Fried Kailan with Garlic added to the treat. Draft pitchers of Tiger Beer and coconut / mango jelly to finish the meal. Reservation is a must.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab and pepper crab - WOW ,40,12-19-16,"I was there with some business colleagues to get some local seafood. The chili crab was great but for me the pepper crab was awesome. I was surprised by the intense pepper taste. So hot and remarkable! To ease the hot food try the coconut water. It became my favourite beverage at Singapore. The atmosphere was... Ehm... It was really crowdy and the plastic chairs don't feel comfortable. Anyway: if you love seafood, go there! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Convenient Long Beach,40,12-17-16,Long Beach seafood is one of the famous Singapore seafood chain. This one is located in the Dempsey park which makes it more convenient than the original on the south coast. Food is good and the location is nice. We enjoyed our chili and pepper crabs.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Actually reasonable value for money,40,12-16-16,"We went to the Long Beach Seafood branch at Dempsey this week. The food was surprisingly reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Pepper crab was S$63 per kilo and beers were just over S$7 each (330ml cans of Heineken). The total bill for 3 persons with more than enough to eat was around S$220. Really not bad. The service was decent, and the waitress cautioned us against ordering too much instead of pushing extra on us. Atmosphere isn't fabulous but it's OK. Probably a much better deal than the tourist traps along Clarke Quay or Boat Quay."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good alternative destination to the East Coast,30,12-15-16,I patronize this branch a few times during a calendar year and food and service quality has remained consistent though it does falter when it is especially crowded. Good plus is free parking at Dempsey.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili Crab is the winner,50,12-09-16,"Its interesting to read the extremes of reviews for this place. I really liked it. Having visited Singapore a few times, I haven't yet found a better chili crab - I guess for my taste. The black pepper crab isn't as good as I have found elsewhere, but I go here to sit outside and eat crab, sauce and buns. It simply doesn't get any more complicated than that. I've not noticed the prices being particularly high and the service is invisible - its just about the chili crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Terrible, food is crap",10,12-04-16,"Everything tasted terrible. You get better taste in any coffee shop. Some dishes were just weird - bitter, too salty... The only thing passable was prawns - which were boiled."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,great seafood.,50,11-26-16,"The seafood was fresh, beautifully cooked and well presented. Everyone in our party thought it was superb."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,not a good experience,10,11-21-16,"Made a reservation for a business group but we were seated under a fan at dusk with bright lights which attracted all sorts of bugs and we could not keep them out of our hair or drinks and so we abandoned all thought of eating here, also they offered one price for locals and a far higher price for non-locals and so would never return here again"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's all about the crab,40,11-15-16,"To eat crab and really enjoy it you have to get down and dirty. There's no way to not use your fingers. Without a proper protective bib you will ruin or at least stain whatever you happen to be wearing. Bibs are thoughtfully provided and discreetly tied around your neck here at Long Beach. And they are very necessary since you will want to get down and dirty with these crabs. The two kinds of crab we tried were the chili crab and the pepper crab, and I would recommend trying both. Sometimes chili crab can be so spicy that you miss the flavor of the succulent meat. I thought they got the spice just right here since it was spicy, but not so spicy that you didn't appreciate the high-quality of the crab. Both were delicious. A fresh shrimp starter was also delicious. The seafood is kept in gigantic tanks in the restaurant so freshness is guaranteed. A noodle dish we ordered late in the game was not quite on the same level. However, you come here to eat seafood not noodles. The restaurant is a bit out-of-the-way but taxis are very reasonable in Singapore. I think chili crab is a must to try here and this would be a great place to do it. Wash it down with your beer of choice. On a sidenote don't bother with the Singapore sling. I think it tastes like chewed bubblegum. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice restaurant to try Chilli Crab,40,11-14-16,"We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend and aware it would be expensive. We specifically wanted to try the Chilli Crab and the black pepper one but it was hard to judge how expensive these would be from the menu. The menu is very long and none of the set menus included both of these for only two people. We explained to our waiter and he said he would bring us two small crabs one of each type, we also ordered a rice dish, a vegetable side and some buns for the crab. For a drink we had a pitcher of beer. The total bill came to around €140 which was ok given we had been warned about the expense and had ordered two expensive dishes. Both crab dishes were nice but if you only get one the black pepper one was the best for both of us. On the whole we really enjoyed our meal. It looked like a place that was full of both expats and locals rather than tourists so a lot of repeat business. Given the chance I'd go back too."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best seafood in town ,50,11-14-16,"Hands down the best crab experience you can have in Singapore. If it gets better than this, you might have to revisit your standards. Wasabi prawn, Alaskan black pepper King crab or just the traditional Singapore style, served with ice cold Singaporean Tiger beer and staff that will make you want to go back two days later (just because you might still be to full to eat on the next day). MUST-TRY"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A terrible but expensive dinner,10,10-31-16,"We read the previous reviews & were looking forward to dining here. What a disappointment. The restaurant is very tired looking with dowdy tablecloths, no napkins provided, plastic plates and some of the worst wait staff we have ever experienced. We chose a 5 course set menu for 4 of us and dishes were plonked down on the table in rapid succession, regardless of whether we had finished a course or not. The miserable waitress splashed us with sauces as she dished up & we had to use the tablecloth to cover our clothes as best we could. The food was poorly presented and whilst the razor clams and pepper crab were tasty, the rest of it was bland and tasteless. They rushed us through all 5 courses within 45 minutes. This was truely the worst dinner we have ever experienced. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but well worth it,50,10-31-16,"I love the food here. From the soup all the way to dessert. Each dish was well executed - taste, presentation. The lobster dish with cereal was worth the extra calories. The chili crab is as I remember how chili crab should be made. The black pepper crab was rightly named Famous Black Pepper Crab :) The steamed fish was so tender, it just melted in the mouth. Even the roast chicken got raves from our dinner guests. Definitely will be back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best seafood meals ever!,50,10-29-16,"This was one of the best seafood meals I have ever had in my life. Along with Restaurant Andre (where I ate during my last visit) this is my favorite place to eat in Singapore.We skipped drinks because we had just come from the rooftop bar at MBS and ordered the food straightaway. We ordered one of their signature set menus.The first course was Steamed Live Scottish Royal Razor Clam with Minced Garlic & Vermicelli and it was my joint-favorite dish of the night. It was followed by their signature dish of Pepper Crabs which was really really good and a close second in terms of taste and flavor for me. This was followed by Fried Leek Flower with dried scallop and olives which was average, I didn't really care for the leek flower. This was followed by my joint favorite dish of the night - Deep Fried Flat Rice Noodleswith ‘La La King’. The deep fried noodles gave the dish the perfect crunch and I just couldn't stop eating. Dessert was Rose Jelly Coconut Cream which was decent but didn't come close to the awesome dishes we had eaten earlier."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome black pepper crab,40,10-27-16,"Three of us ordered 1.2kg black pepper crab, kailan veg with garlic, deep fried calamari, and cereal prawns. All the dishes were very good with the crab being awesome. I recommend to get a plate of buns (fried or steamed) and ask the waiters to bring some extra Chili Crab sauce for 'dipping'. The black proper crab is a little more spicy and assertive on your tongue, whereas the chili crab is a little sweeter - I prefer the former. The meal came to about SGD $220 which is reasonable given the items. Be wary of them pushing their set menu which is a lot of food for about $120-130/head. Overall, one of the best crab spots in Singapore. The Dempsey area is great with lots of other dining and beverage options. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big portions,50,10-27-16,"We had a good talk with the manager on the choice of the menu and she recommended us the set dinner and was happy to accept alterations to it, extremely service oriented. The menu for 6, though 4 of us were Europeans, was more than enough, had to bring doggy bags."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs and More,40,10-23-16,I usually bring overseas guests to this place as they normally stay around Orchard Road. The old colonial buildings are always a conversation piece.The chilli and pepper crabs are always well received by my guests. I must add that they are actually fantastic and spiciness tweaked to guests preference! The service is also great....maybe since I am there often. And they serve my favourite Erdinger beer!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cosy family dinner away from the city,40,10-20-16,"The set dinner menu was excellent for a table of 10 and we could not even finish it all! Had to 'doggie bag' the left overs.The ambience was great and what was more excellent, was the attention being paid to the us by the service staff and especially one of the staff - Shirley Sun. She was a great and pleasant host to us all! She was quick and pre emptive to know our needs and wants which she never failed to deliver within a prompt amount of time.The food was good, not excellent but enough to satisfy our love for chilli crabs!I will visit here again with my family!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab and Chilli Prawns,40,10-18-16,"Myself and son visited this place for lunch today. We ordered the following :-1) Margarita- the cocktail was just about average.2) Pepper Crab- this was awesome, the best part was that they shelled the same on request. Eating it without all the effort was superb. Fresh crab, succulent meat. Spice was just perfect and recommend for those who enjoy pepper and spice.3) Chilli Prawns/Shrimps- the chilli sauce or gravy and the perfectly cooked fresh Prawns are an awesome combination. Dip the hot, soft and really soft buns into the gravy and it is paradise.4) Veg/mushroom noodles- was just average nothing to rave about. The service was attentive and good. Prices are almost fine dining prices. Enjoyable experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood!,50,10-04-16,Excellent chilli crab. Good value with excellent service. We opted for a set menu with a couple of extra dishes which was a good way to have a selection of what is on offer
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to try pepper or chili crab,40,10-04-16,"As one of the most famous and expensive (relatively speaking) restaurants that serve pepper or chili crab, Long Beach has a big reputation to live up to...and it did deliver. We tried both the chili and black pepper crab which were both excellent. Would also highly recommend the fried prawns prepared using their 'house special' style as well as the seafood fried rice. While we didn't try the set menu options they seemed to offer decent value given the range of dishes it allows to sample. Restaurant offers also a range of other seafood dishes. Given its reputation the place was packed and reservations are required. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab To DIE FOR!,50,09-28-16,For the best seafood in SINGAPORE if not the world! Nothing like Alaskan King Crab flown in and marinated in delicious black pepper. What an amazing team dinner!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Finger lickin Pepper crab and live steamed razor clams,50,09-23-16,"Be realistic about what you're looking for, you want a place that does seafood (especially crab) and does it well.We normally don't do set menus but the S$148++ menu had what we wanted after reading reviews, the Black pepper crab that this company 'pioneered' and steamed live razor clams. Easy.The razor clams came out in individual serves, surrounded by a fragrant flavourful broth, and a garlicky vermicelli with sweet clam meat. Delicious. The pepper crab was just as expected, peppery goodness with lots of sweet mud crab meat. Don't be shy to lick your fingers. When the staff offer to pick the claw meat out for you, take up the offer. It ended up being half a crab each person (4 pieces each).We didn't really expect much from the next dishes but the fried leek flower with dried scallop and olive was a good taste bud refresher after the crab, followed by a bland looking but very tasteful deep fried flat noodle dish with clams. Also a theatrical dessert of rose jelly coconut cream, dry-ice drama and all. Not overly sweet, by refreshingWe went on a weekday lunch after an easy simple booking via website and prompt confirmation via email the day before. It wasn't busy at 1pm, the staff were absolutely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was casual but the service was a notch above, dishes flowed seamlessly and the wait staff were keeping tab on our progress to ensure this (at a distance of course). Some reviewers complained about the cost but expecting to pay rock bottom prices for seafood just bc you can get a $4 meal at a hawker centre in this country is unreasonable, the price was comparable to any decent mud crab/live seafood restaurant in other parts of the world. Also, I don't understand why you would give a bad review based on your definition of what lobster should taste like at a restaurant most people choose for the crab. We walked from the Tanglin gate of the botanic gardens, 20 minutes in midday heat but next time we'll use uber, the Dempsey hill area has lots of little roads leading to other retail outlets so you could end up walking around a bit to find Long beach at the back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place for seafood lovers,50,09-21-16,"Most people told me about this place for chili crab and pepper crab. But I was warned that it was for ""tourists"". So I had mixed feelings but I still went over. I went for salty egg sauce crab, some green and noodles Hong Kong way. Wow absolutely fabulous, so delicious. Amazing taste whatever you take. Extraordinary! Plus the setting is great, old colonial house on Dempsey road, under the palms, in the green. Loved it!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Singapore's Hot Spot for Chilli Crabs ,50,09-19-16,"Expensive yes, however the world famous Singaporean Chilli Crabs do not taste or served better elsewhere. It's a must try if you want the real thing."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place for Business dinner,30,09-06-16,"Good and convenient location near Orchard area. Nice environment away from the city with ample parking spaces. The place is crowded even during weekdays because of business dinners. If you plan to dine here advance booking is highly recommended.Food wise it is nothing to shout about. We had the usual chilli and pepper crab and tasted just like those in other restaurants. If you like the chilli gravy to dip the fried buns in, the chilli crab does come with a lot of gravy. Taste of steam fish is over powered by the spicy sauce. Sauce of the clam dish tasted just like that of chilli crab even though the waitress said it has sambal added. The silver fish fried rice was good though; very well fried with a little bit of crunch from the silver fish.Service was good even though you could tell they were struggling to manage. You can see diners getting impatient waiting for their dessert and bills toward the end of the night.Overall a good place for a business dinner but not for a family meal where you expect something special."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chile Stone Crabs Never Disappoint,50,08-23-16,Stone crabs and tiger beer a winning combination at Long Beach Restaurant. Dine outdoors on the lovely porch and enjoy! I am in Singapore ever year for business and always make it here -- my 3rd trip!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top notch quality from the original creators of the black pepper crab,50,08-23-16,"It's been a long time since I ate at Long Beach Seafood. It's been a household name for the longest time. I was not too optimistic when I entered the restaurant because the interior looked jaded. I was wondering if the food and staff will be jaded as well. After my friends decided on what to have for lunch, we placed our orders-A 3.5kg Blue Alaskan crab cooked both ways-Chilli and white pepper, Geoduck sashimi, Golden Line Lobster, Fish Maw soup and veggies.The manager told us that there were only two Blue Alaskan crab and we took on of it. When the crab arrived we asked if they could de-shell it for us. The staff was more then willing and we were happy to hear that. Not only did they de-shell it they also played it nicely and we were impressed. When we tasted it-it was OMG! One of the best chilli crab we ever had, the meat was sweet and tender to the bite and the sauce was top notch bursting with flavors or the spices and chilies. Next can the white pepper crab and man it took it to another level! The white pepper sauce had a Nic buttery taste to it as we dipped the crabmeat into it and into our mouths. My friend who always had a judgement for most foods was speechless! I enjoyed that moment. Next came the Geoduck it was sweet and crunchy as a sashimi. They also told us to dip the other part of the geoduck into the double boiled stock to remove the smell. And it tasted so good but way better then abalone. Mind blowing! The lobster was good too and fish maw soup was delicious. Overall we had an excellent lunch and the seafood was top notch in terms of flavors and freshness. A must visit if you ever come to Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good service, food was very good but pricey for such a casual restaurant",30,08-21-16,Service very good and being new to the local seafood scene lots of help with ordering and recommendations. Chili and pepper crab very good as were the razor clams. Only observation is that is really is a very casual dining experience but at a high price point. Mainly catering to the expat and tourist crowd so lacked that local feel.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fun for overseas guests,30,08-13-16,"Long beach has many branches but this one at Dempsey is my favourite. Easy parking, huge with lots of private rooms. Seafood here always fresh and great place for overseas guests who wanna try chilli crab or pepper crab!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Service!,50,08-09-16,"The food is really amazing, as its freshly prepared and extremely delicious. We did have a small issue with the sambal chili used (Because it smelt wierd on the bass) but overall the experience is really amazing. The staff are also attentive and friendly, making the atmosphere really friendly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"awesome experience, but expensive",40,08-08-16,"wow, this was awesome. messy, spicy crab but so worth it. we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer. service was great. didn't seem like a touristy place at all. my only complaint is how expensive it is. the crab and all the sides we had were great, but I wish it could have been a more reasonable price. oh well, everything in SG is expensive. I'd go back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"""Yummy Yummy Chilli Crab""",50,08-07-16,"Had dinner with friends and family last night. We enjoyed the Chilli Crab most with the Mantou or Chinese fried buns compared to the Black Pepper . Cereal Live prawn was so-so. A different taste from your usual ""Zhi Char"" stall. You have an option to have this dish with or without the shell of the prawns. We tried the one without prawn shell as we were lazy to peel them. The deep fried baby squid was yummy . My all time favourite dish when dinning at Long Beach Dempsey. Worth trying the Beancurd dish with Chef special sauce . Many thanks especially to Assistant Manager William and his team Man Yanyan who always takes good care of my family and friends . Service was excellent even though the restaurant was running full house yesterday . Remember to book table in advance to avoid disappointment especially the weekends. Private rooms are available from min spending of S$600 onwards .. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy Sri Lankan black pepper Crab,50,08-01-16,The best and biggest Sri Lankan pepper crab ever. 2kg for 2 person to share. Steamed razor clam from Scotland. Stir fried Baby kai lan with crispy salted fish and their signature crispy tofu. Full with Great satisfaction!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sea food,40,07-29-16,"I highly recommend the chili and peper crab. Good service and nice atmosphere. Although located in the center of Singapore, you are around nature."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Desapointing,20,07-28-16,If you want to be sad about how to degrade a decent lobster go there. Only the black peper crab is interresting . Service is at rush and place has no interrest . One time largely enough .
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood dinner with friends,30,07-27-16,Open restaurant with private dining rooms available. Food is good and delightful. Winelist is rather limited. Service is above average.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea foods ,40,07-24-16,"Thinking about seafoods at good restaurant at weekend in Singapore without a prior booking, forget it as there's always a long que at fully booked ones! I was lucky to have one table for at this rest. one week ago. The geo duck was fresh and great for shasimi, the black peper crab is the specility of the chain since its early day and still keeping to its fame! Tip is that you should book a few days ahead for weeken to get an indoor table and order everything you want from begining or wait for quite a time as it's too crowded! Overall it's worth the price!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food,40,07-22-16,Was there for a business dinner and we started with deep fried prawn which is well seasoned. Next was cili and black pepper crab. The crab was big and I had the privilege of eating the claws. Personally for me black pepper crab taste better despite its more spicy. Steam fish with cili is okay and would prefer just plain steam. The scallop was soft and tender. The steam clam was cooked perfectly. The only let down was the fried rice which has not much taste. That was the only dish that was left nearly untouched. Overall it was a nice seafood experience and would recommend those who loves fresh seafood
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy yummy,40,07-17-16,"Cant use words to describe how delicious of the food. You can try different crabs in singapore, this one with black pepper is highly recommended for those who love spicy."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sensational Singaporean Seafood,50,07-16-16,"ScrubySnacks loves seafood and Long Beach did not disappoint at all. Every single thing we ordered was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. As per usual, we over ordered but spent many hours simply grazing and enjoying the wonderful vibrant atmosphere of the restaurant and fantastic service from their chirpy and entertaining staff. Highlights were definitely the steamed crab and pepper crab. The very enthusiastic waitress even helped to crack the claws open for us which made it even more enjoyable. The crispy mini octopus was also deliciously sweet and moorish. If you are in Singapore and looking for the very best seafood, ScrubySnacks would highly recommend a visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey. Cannot wait to return, next time with elasticated pants. And don't forget to wear the bibs as things can get a little messy, but don't worry, it's all part of the fun and experience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Exclusive Golden Phoenix fish,50,07-09-16,"We went on a warm evening, and glad we had a ceiling fan at our table. David Ng, assistant manager, really made some great recommendations. We simply had bamboo clams, Hongkong style steam Golden Phoenix fish, mushroom and vegetables. David shared that Long Beach has the exclusive Golden Phoenix fish in Singapore, all imported from Malaysia highlands. I was skeptical as this is a fresh water fish, but it really tasted very good. Will be back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food and lovely place,50,07-01-16,"We had dinner in this place in our second day in Singapore. A good friend of mine invited us there to taste Singapore as the locals do. The experience as great and the price very good. We had crab, prawns, soup, snacks and all very nice and nice taste!i recommend this place for good food and value!thanks for everything Maria"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Uneven night for service and food,30,06-30-16,"We dined on a Tuesday night but it felt like a weekend since all the tables were full and the place was very busy. We had some issues at the start with a server who didn`t understand English was was quite surprising since the place is so busy with ex-pats and foreign visitors. We tried many dishes and some were great - the Scottsh razor clams, Black Pepper and Chilli crab for example. Others like the steamed fish and prawns were fairly average. The steamed fish had been cut up away from the table and seemed to have been a rushed job since it full of bones. Service was slow throughout the night which was a little understandable with it being so busy. Overall pleasant evening but nothing to get over excited about."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place for local cuisine and Crabs,50,06-29-16,"This is the place to visit if you want to try the local way of cooking the Crab Dish. Try the Chiili Crabs with buns or the Black Pepper Crab if you like spicy food . For children or adults that do not take spicy food , you could try the mouth watering salted-egg crab. The restaurant also served delicious seafood cuisine cooked mostly the Cantonese style. The restaurant is set in a exquisite location -Dempsey where many other restaurant and cafes are located too . Nearby you could also visit quite a few furniture gallery which sell very nice wooden items . Enjoy "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood Restaurant ,50,06-28-16,There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore. Our family has visited the various shops of the various brands. Long beach at Dempsey Hill is top in our list. A bit further away from city centre but it is worth to spend the time on the travel
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A heaven for sea food lovers ,40,06-28-16,"The Mecca for sea food lovers with the black pepper crab a must try! Loved it! The chilli crab palors before it. A special mention of the Singapore prawn curry, I loved it so much I bought loads of the curry paste to carry back with me. The place though has a peculiar smell but it is probably attributed to the sea food holding tanks which makes the decor of the restaurant. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average Dining Experience,40,06-22-16,"We went for dinner as recommended by friends.
The staff that attended us was friendly & attentive, however the food was just average."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very good seafood restaurant,40,06-21-16,"Dempsey hill with all the restaurants, pubs and clubs is a very nice place to visit. During our last visit in Singapore we went to the Long Beach restaurant. The food was very good. We had the famous chili crab and several local dishes. We enjoyed it very much. Prices were also quite reasonable. Also for the beers and wine. Wine and beers can be very expensive in Singapore restaurants."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Original and best ,50,06-20-16,Not many words required. Just go. Order the black pepper crab. It's simply delicious. Messy. But delicious. Don't bother with napkins. Get stuck in and just wash your hands in the basins later. Enjoy.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Messy Dinner,30,06-13-16,"Great place to experience the Singaporean cuisine away from the touristy track. We ordered the chilli Crab, amongst other specialties. The food was excellent but for some reason they are stingy on the hand towels for such a messy meal. It's well priced"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Could be summed up in a word ""YUMMY!""",40,06-12-16,"The name LONG BEACH has been a Singapore icon since it began in all humility on a sandy beach by the lapping tide in Bedok, long long ago circa 1970's. The original LONG BEACH was run by a couple who served up the most delicious chilli crab EVER! Today there are several outlets and this one in Dempsey is but one. It was my son's birthday and his dear wife organised (and paid for) our family dinner there. We got a private room, not a mean feat, (the lady has clout!)The food was delicious and a good meal was had by all. They have some children play equipment downstairs, should there be a need to entertain the little ones.Uber may be a good idea for carpark spaces are filled up fast."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ate until we were too full to move!,40,06-09-16,"Another place we visited recommended by our friends. A bit crowded when we came, but our order came fast somehow. The chili crabs were really great, especially the black pepper. My wife and I ate so much that we were too full to move. Thankful for the waiter's (Adam if not wrong and he was just wonderful with his service) for his constant refills of water and suggesting the ice cream as dessert. Kind of expensive but we think it was worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Pepper Crab, amazing !!!",50,05-29-16,"Great food, fast service. A must for any traveller to Singapore. The seafood is excellent and a nice setting at Dempsey Hill"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab!,40,05-15-16,"We always try different chili crab restaurant every time we go to Singapore and so far, this is the best. We went with our friends, and forgot to tell them to serve the fried rice together with the chili crab and everything, not in the end (it's their culture to eat the cheap food in the end) "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"OMG, try the chilli crabs!",40,05-08-16,"If you are new in town, check out Damsey hill and definately make a visit to Long Beach for their chilli crabs. Sure the place is a little pricey compace to some other places in town, but Once you taste that thick, glorious gravy with soft fried buns, you'll know it was worth it. They have some set meals which works out quite worth it for group dining as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab lived up to reputation,40,05-08-16,"Early Saturday evening managed to secure a table for four even though we had not bookedOrdered the signature prawns, I really liked, but the family were not that impressedThe Black pepper Crab was a little slow in arriving bit worth the wait.Don't know why we have been before as just around the corner!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab rules!,40,05-02-16,Long Beach is a well establish local seafood restaurant and their Dempsey location is designed to be more upscale than their original place. The service is good and the location is easy to get to in the city. We had wonderful pepper crab which is my favourite dish. We also had a very good fried pomfret fish. Good place for local seafood when you visit Singapore. I actually prefer it to their beach location.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Too famous.,30,05-02-16,"So busy we hardly saw our waiter, and they had no time to explain things on the menu. Just told us what we should order. The chili sauce was too sweet for me, and the crabs we got had no roe or innards of any kind, so they were missing the best part. Way expensive for what you get."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach - Longing To Go Back,40,05-01-16,"@TheKuoKnowsMany people will say there are only two names worth considering for the famous Singapore Chillie Crab. The truth is there are many.But my favourite is probably one of the two popular names, namely, Long Beach @ Dempsey.There are several Long Beach outlets. For some, the Dempsey outlet might not be as scenic as its more popular East Coast Seafood Centre. But it can be a lot easier to get to by public transport.Reserving a table ahead of time is recommended, especially at weekends. It can even be a good idea to book a couple of days in advance, if you prefer to dine in the comfort of air-conditioning.Long Beach's offering is quite extensive. But I generally stick with the set menus, which is more than adequate. The portions are generous to a fault. So a set meal for two should feed three quite comfortably. If not, just add an extra dish. I recommend the Coffee Ribs!Perhaps the toughest choice is whether to opt for the Chillie or the Black Pepper Crab. It really comes down to personal choice. For me, it always has to be the Chillie Crab, complemented with a portion of Man Tou to soak up the sauce.Long Beach is a credit to Singapore eateries. I have never been disappointed. I have never found the service wanting. I have never left the restaurant hungry! But I do always long to go back for more."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place to go for crabs,50,04-29-16,"We went there after a long day in the meeting and by 8pm they were full. Good that we have reservations. Of course Singapore is famous for their huge chilli crabs but this place also serve white peper crabs. Maybe for me chilli crab is now common, I kind of like the pepper crab more. It comes with additional white pepper sauce for those who likes the strong pepper aroma. My colleague who is vegetarian had to watch all those shell cracking but he insisted that his fried rice and shitake mushroom with beancurd were all very tasty too. The meal is supposed to end with a great dessert in durian pudding but unfortunately they ran out of it and we had to go with the mango pudding, which was good but you know, its not the king of fruit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli crabs indulge in nice setting!,50,04-25-16,"Been to this branch of the franchise several times and always find it a hit due to the Dempsey Road 'upscale' dining location. Nice place to bring family and overseas friends to have seafood, get your hands dirty over chilli crabs and other yummy seafood. Can set you back quite a bit depending on what seafood you order and recommend to make reservations if you are going over the weekends but definitely a great dining experience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent meal--ate too much!,40,04-24-16,"I visited this restaurant with a group of colleagues as a special occasion. We had an excellent meal, with various dishes, including their signature Chili Crab. Each dish was well prepared and well presented. In the end, we had more food that we really needed, with the result that most of us ate too much. The ice cream and red bean sauce that came at the end of the meal actually helped overcome the feeling of ""fullness"". The only potential damper on the evening was the fact that the restaurant refused to call cabs for us when we were ready to leave."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab was outstanding ,50,04-22-16,Visit Long Beach @ Dempsey at the recommendation of my hotel concierge. Very nice and not too expensive. Food was great and staff was awesome.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,40,04-21-16,All I can say is they serve the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore hands down! The place can get real busy but it will definitely be worth the wait. Big plus for me was the Filipina who manages the table bookings. She got us a table inside where it was cooler. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Food!,40,04-19-16,"Booked a private room as it was night out with colleagues. First time here, and I was very impressed with the quality of food. I would suggest booking a table outdoors if you enjoy the tropical weather.Try the Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Lobster salad!Downside though, the service was sort of disoriented as the dishes that were supposed to be appetizers came out late while the crabs came first. We were a group of 15 though, so I am not sure if it is the usual occurrence or a fluke. Nonetheless, the food was definitely worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Historic Setting and Great Food,50,04-17-16,"We enjoyed a business dinner here and had a lovely experience in a private room. Fresh seafood in a variety of preparations, including a beautiful whole fish prepared to perfection."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,If it's chilli crab you want...,30,04-16-16,"..this is the place. I'm not a big fan of spicy food but the crab, fish and seafood we ate here was very tasty. Only downside is it's messy eating and lack of napkins so up and down to wash hands. Service was a little slow at times. Beer by the pitcher was good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Delicious, and nice touches",40,04-13-16,"Delicious: chilli crab (spicy yet subtle and not over-powering), deep fried baby squid, pork ribs. Nice touches: bibs and crab shells unusually well pre-cracked that further cracking was not need to get to the contents. Efficient and responsive service; perhaps being a weekend and not full helped. Pricey; as expected for fresh seafood."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not greqt,30,04-09-16,"Friday night out with business colleagues. Food was good, not great. Service was just ok......prefer Jumbo Seafood, waitress not as helpful as we would have expected, but still overall fair to good experience. Don't think I will go back to this location.....just too many good rests in Singapore that act like they want my business!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood,40,04-04-16,"Was craving for razor clam and theirs are great, yummy. The crispy squid and tofu also yummy. The crab is ok, nothing special, same with all chilli crab. In overall its a good seafood restaurant, but reservation is highly recommended as its so crowded even at 6pm"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Overall, a good meal",40,04-01-16,"We had one of the set and overall the dishes are good. We had crabs cooked 3 different ways - chilli, black pepper and salted eggyork. The fish was fresh and the steamed prawns is cooked just right and juicy...just a little small for my likingRoasted chicken is good, aromaticThe fried rice (with small little fish on top) looked bland but packed quite a bit of flavor and I think there are small crunchy salted bits of fish in it tooFish maw soup was very watery, although not lacking in flavor.Had also the 4 combination starter - too salty for one dish and they are all fried, this is the lowest in my list from the meal.Veg with 3 eggs came very soupy, and I loved the soup!The stir fry veg with garlic is quite the standard fareI opted for their signature durian pudding for dessert. It is quite thick with bits of the fruit, but it was below my expectation as it doesn't give me the omph I was looking for.There was a big waiting gap between the crab and the rest of the dishes. Our plates got piled up very quickly with crab shell, but after a while the service staff got around quickly replacing them.Overall, the meal was very good as the +s are more than the misses.Will return "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good sefood,40,03-30-16,A good place for some authentic Chinese seafood a good menu that caters for all types. we were there for a quick business lunch. Good selection good service and the food experience and tastes were wonderful. Spend some time and try the menu.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper crab,30,03-28-16,"Good tofu, great pepper crab, but make sure they take the crab meat out of the shell because they will do a better cleaner job than you can! Get a table in front of the crab tanks for atmosphere. The rooms on the far side are lifeless and AC is too cold. Parking is easy outside. Im not sure the set menu is good value, we felt quite hussled into ordering it. Service is excellent."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome,40,03-19-16,"Nice food, great service...what else can you expect? chilly crab is the best, and the shrimps with garlic lol....recomended"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food delivered very efficiently,40,03-19-16,"This place runs like a well-oiled machine. Good service, good food with the white pepper crab a standout. I have no idea about the cost because one of our group picked up the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dated!,10,03-13-16,1st bottle of wine....not available....2nd not also...third time lucky. All the plastic chairs are dirty. Not what I expected from an apparently first class seafood restaurant. Very dated.....the people who own this restaurant need to think about the mouse analogy. Going back for the same piece of cheese that is not there. Could be so much better. Absolute rip off. Ordered a margarita and it was pathetic! How much do you want to cheat people. Great setting.....but crap.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Expensive Tourist Trap,20,03-08-16,"We hope this place is merely resting on past laurels, and hasn’t always served food this undistinguished and pricey. It’s not that the quality of the food is bad - it’s fresh seafood after all so how badly can you mangle it? — but the prices are stratospheric and the portions small. The pepper crab is the signature dish and for $50 for a medium portion, there was not much of it. (It’s brought from Sri Lanka.) A small side dish of a few pieces of broccoli was $12. The ambience is nothing special - a bit chaotic actually (which wouldn’t have bothered us if the food were more memorable). It seems to attract wealthy residents and people on expense accounts (for whom $200/four not including alcohol is normal) and tourists - who think they’re going to get something special (that was us). Give it a miss. There is much better food to be had in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Private Room - Privilege Service,40,02-29-16,"It was a business dinner and we were allocated 2 private rooms with a great view of the greenery behind Long Beach @ Dempsey. Our VIPs from Europe and UK were very pleased with this view as we sip beers and discuss about various matters.Having been to Long Beach @ Dempsey for many times, it seems dishes served to private rooms are of higher quality in terms of flavor and decoration. At least, this time round, the food was excellent and our visitors very much enjoyed their meal to the last piece.The captains were attentive with our requests. They paid good attention to our VIPs, for example, servicing them with apron when the ever famous chili crab dish was served. Of course, they never forget us too! Fully pleased with the services.We will continue to recommend this place for Business Dinners if VIPs are interested in excellent seafood and peaceful greenery."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood,40,02-28-16,"The seafood is still good as before. I personally still enjoy the chill crab, still creamy and go very well dipping it with bread. If you want it spicy, you will be disappointed as it is not spicy. But the black pepper crab are more spicy than the chilli crab. The Thai style squid are chewy and with the Thai chilli sauce on it are not over power and the cabbage goes along well too. The bamboo clam cook with the garlic are well cook too.Average price if you want Crab, Prawn, Fish and squid are between S$60-90/person"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super sea food !,50,02-22-16,Long beach is ideal place for Chinese sea food lovers and a great hangout place for team and group dinners with quality beer and wine. We ordered lobsters and crab and it was awesome.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious food in an unpretentious setting!,40,02-18-16,"Chilli crab, pepper crab, clams with garlic to start! Fabulous! Don't forget to try the bread for dipping! We were lucky to visit with friends that helped us choose the best options!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crabs - the best ,40,02-10-16,"Had a family gathering with delicious food ! Have the Singapore chili crab - great sauce, remember to order the steam and fried bread to scoop up the gravy !! Black pepper crab - crab so fresh n well cooked. Try the cereal prawns - one of the best with so fine cereal crumbs n tasty fresh prawns. The service was prompt and efficient too. We will be back !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Never Disappoint Us....,40,02-09-16,This is the place that we hold our Chinese reunion dinner@Chinese New Year Eve....Black pepper chilli crabs were as good as expected....they added new dishes into their menu....wasabi prawns and fried hor fun was real special and tasted really good....The atmosphere was nice and good attentive service....We will come back again next year.....
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A bit too expensive,30,02-04-16,A crowded restaurant with a few branches in Singapore. Famous for their crabs. The famous chili crab is abit too spicy. Slight expensive
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great disappointment ,30,01-30-16,"I was looking forward to a great meal but was utterly disappointed. Lohei was not nice. The baby abalone, in place of salmon,tasted fishy. The bamboo clams were ok. The cereal baby lobsters were a bit too salty. The black pepper crab were too spicy. The clams were to appetizing. The fried rice tasted bland. Only saving grace was the dessert. I don't know what happen to them. Last year, I was still enjoying. Even their fried rice were tasty. It's a great disappointment for a place so well known and so pricey, "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Chili Crab, Pepper Crab, incredible fish",50,01-18-16,"Great food, good service. several choices of dining areas, indoors, outdoors, private rooms with AC. Book in advance. You can bring your own wine or sake. True Singapore Crab dishes."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big disappointment,20,01-18-16,"I was looking forward to try the black pepper crab and chilli crab as it was recommended to definitely try in singapore. My boyfriend was looking on tripadvisor and we wanted to go to the main restaurant but there was no table, our concierge recommended another closer to the hotel, but same company, so we booked. First of all they wanted to sit us, at the washing area, looked horrible, smelled bad, obviously I told them Im not gonna sit there...The restaurant is not cheap, and I was ready to pay for excellent food, and restaurant, but not on plastic chairs, watching the dishwashers gumboots and the cleaning process during my dinner. Not to mention, we dressed up nicely. They asked us to wait, the lady was not really helpful, after 10min we got a nice table. I was ready to forget the bad start, but.. The staff was NOT kind at all, it was around 8:30 pm, felt like they want to go home so much, waiting for the shift to finish. Nobody spoke proper english, at least those who were in contact with us. The crab was ok, but nothing amasing. At the end we paid about 150 EUR for 2 pax ( dinner and drink). Did not worse the money"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Razor Clam,40,01-15-16,"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurant in Singapore, they serve the best crab. But my favorite is razor clam steam with garlic and the canadian live oyster. They have live alaskan crab woow"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best black pepper crab!,50,01-14-16,"Had an amazing meal at long beach. Black pepper crab was so intense in flavour & the chilli crab was lovely and rich, it was such a shame to have to leave the rest of the sauce! We also had the whole peeking duck which I highly recommend. Having the skin taken off & rolled up into pancakes at our table then having the meet brought back stir fried over crispy noodles was one of the most memorable and tasty meals of my trip."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Huge delicious crabs. Consistently good restaurant ,40,01-09-16,A staple with my family. Black pepper and chilli crabs are really good. Probably only in Singapore. Fried baby squid and belacan clams also v delicious. I particularly enjoy the thick and fragrant sauces. We had three 2 kg crabs. Huge and meaty. S$78 per kg. Very enjoyable!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper crab ever,50,01-08-16,"Basically, we echo what other reviews have already mentioned. If money is not an object, do go for a treat. Between my wife and I, we ordered 800g of Black pepper crab, deep fried fish (Yaw cham soon hock), mushroom and vegetable tofu and two drinks. It was S$168. It was pricey but the crab was the best we have eaten. What was surprising was the fish! It was so well done and tasty. Soft and fluffy with a simple but yummy soya like sauce. Overall, it was a real foodie experience. Unfortunately, there were no razor clams that day. A real disappointment. To be honest I have not tried others like Jumbo or many other places but I will definitely go on a foodie hunt next time we are back in Singapore. You might want to try their set menu which cost somewhat similar but you get desert. You might want to ask how much crap you get."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not so good anymore,30,01-03-16,"Must have when in Singapore, Chilli Crab.Jumbo is fully reserved one week ahead, so no choice, we have to settle for Long Beach. This is our second time here after a year.We book table inside (Aircond) but when arrived was told no table inside so have to sit non Aircond table outside. Since they are packed all the time, its take it or leave it.As tourist, well, we have no choice!We order Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Fried Kangkung.Chilli Crab is good but not as good as before. Standard has drop. Black Pepper Crab is spicy but nice. Well, the meal cost SGD 305 (with GST) inclusive of Chinese tea and desserts, rather expensive! But it satisfied our Chilli Crab crave :-)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Definitely must go for seafood in city center,40,12-30-15,"Very tasty and delicious seafood. Great location, across from the Botanical Gardens. Nicely located in greenery with various bars walking distance for after meal drinks. Fast service. Definitely a genuine taste of Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best and fast seafood ,50,12-25-15,"Freshly made seafood some even taken live from the tanks, fast service that brings you the food in twenty minutes even long taking food like crab. Surely one of the best seafood restraints in Singapore and I encourage them to put out more branches"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Better pepper crab,40,12-08-15,"We orignally were heading top Jumbo on Dempsey Hill but was convinced to try Long Beach for pepper crab. As it's the first time we've been to Long Beach we ordered the set menu with pepper crab. Wife was really happy with the food, where each dish was quite good and the flow was commendable. Started with steamed razor clam with minced garlic. Clam itself was fresh but a bit ordinary. It was however the garlic, shallots and soy souce that was memorable. Light and not to salty or pungent. Pepper crab was a bit spicey but better than Jumbo's. Ordered a mud crab, slightly smaller than what I would have like, where the crab meat filled the shell and was very moist. The noodles with clams was very nice too. Even the vegetable dish was a treat. All in all, I think we polished off everything served. A bit pricey but both my wife and I agreed when we're around Dempsey Hill we'd be going back to Long Beach over Jumbo in the future. Location is a bit of a problem as you need a taxi to get there and back. We asked the restaurant to call a cab for us, which worked out well. Could improve on the furniture and interior though as everything looked a bit worn. Other eateries on Dempsey Hill have a flasher look but less patrons. Couldn't hurt to update the presentation. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yes, this is the best pepper crab in Singapore",50,11-29-15,"The interior in seafood restaurants in Singapore is generally not what you normally associate with fine dining. You sit on plastic chairs and you can forget about white linen. But no big deal – you go there to enjoy the crabs and eating them is a messy affair.Long Beach claims that they are “creator of the original and the best pepper crab of Singapore”. I am personally a big pepper crab fan but I don´t take tag lines like that for granted without my own research.As expat living in Singapore I have done thorough investigations across the island in my search for Singapore´s best papper crabs. My conclusion: the pepper crabs in Long Beach really are the best in Singapore. They are juicy, spicy and deliciously prepared.Case closed.In addition, Long Beach is a nice and an easy accessible place. Book table, take your time and enjoy your food.Not all seafood places in Singapore have the same attitude."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,best Chili crab,50,11-19-15,"The Long Beach restaurant is still the best place for Chili crab or black pepper. Big portion, service is good and fun.
very fresh sea food. A great place to bring your oversea visitors ."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,50,11-14-15,"We only had one night in Singapore on a stop over. We made reservations after we were recommended it by a friend from Singapore and we're glad that we did as this place is very busy. We went for the set menu and tried the razor clams, noodles la la and black pepper crab. It was all delicious...if not a little messy to eat! Would highly recommend, not too expensive. 148 dollars for 2 people set menu which was more than enough food. Full of locals and ex-pats, a taxi is needed to get there."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Hey, quite ok actually!",40,11-06-15,"Went there with visitors from Europe, did not expect much but was happily surprised. Nice service compared to jumbo, good crabs + rice + veggies + fish.
Only downturn... Very expensive... SGD110/head..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea food,40,11-02-15,Long Beach @ Dempsey is really easy to get to but do make sure you book as it does get very busy especially weekends and holidays. You can either request to sit out doors or inside the restaurant. Evenings in Singapore are pleasant so it's not a problem. I love the chilli crab so that's always one dish I order.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,CHILI CRAB - A MUST!,40,10-29-15,"I have been here a couple of times with my colleagues. Food wise it's slightly better than it's next door seafood neighbor. Their floor staff is always on the ball, ensuring you get what you wanted. Best to make reservation before heading there, opt for private room if you are spending more SGD600 per table. Private room able to combine if you have more than 1 table."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab delight! ,40,10-07-15,I had the chili crab and it's as good as my taste buds expected . They say it's more known for black pepper crab but didn't have a chance to try it . The mango sago was just ok but bonus points on presentation . The crispy kangkong with cuttlefish was average ... I wish I had the baby kailan instead . I'll rate the resto 3.5 stars but rounded up since I put more weight on the delicious crab over the other average dishes and average service. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Singapore seafood in informal setting,30,10-02-15,"Came here at the suggestion of local friends to taste chilli crab. It was good, but not great. Better the pepper crab. Both priced at SGD 72. Also interesting is the razor clam, huge but overpriced at SGD 16 EACH. With some house prawns (SGD 30) and some side dishes, plus 5 Tiger beer, the bill was SGD 400, IMHO a bit excessive considering the cheap setting, paper napkins and basic level of service.Be careful not to take a table at the far end of the terrace or you might end up spending the evening listening to the karaoke next door..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood Experience away from the bright lights,40,09-19-15,"Making the trip to Dempsey Road, near Holland Village is worth your taxi fare. Being welcomed by all staff at the front door and being ushered into the Restaurant surrounded by large glass tanks brimming with fresh and very active seafood.The initial ""wow"" was tempered by the extensive range of extremely fresh crabs, lobsters, fish plus anything else you can name. The sight of large live Alaskan Crabs is worth a visit without even looking at the extensive range of other seafood.Oysters - some of the best I have ever had and this comes from someone who lives on the Western Australian coast!The staff were attentive without being ""in your face"" and they had as much fun as we did over an enjoyable luncheon.Food prices very reasonable but, as usual, alcohol was expensive and no shock as this seems to be the practice - charge maximum dollars for alcoholic drinks.The visit to Long Beach was well worth it - great meal, great venue and away from the normal hustle and bustle of the city centre. Try it you will not be disappointed. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great time, go crab!",40,09-19-15,"We came here with 9 people and had a private room. We got one of the 10 course dinners,more at least it seemed like ten courses. We had both the chili and pepper crab. Both were excellent. The other food was also quite good. The pudding dessert had a great presentAtion due to the dry ice. All of us were extremely satisfied. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Local food, great taste",40,09-17-15,"I was taken here by people in the know. This is not fine dining, its rough and ready with plastic chairs. Service is fun and on it, really enjoyed the banter, although not completely sure anyone knew what was going on. So, we had some starters and then the main event which was Chili and Black Pepper crab. Strangely do eat the Chili crab first as the Black Pepper leaves your mouth numb. Fortunately some local noodle dish took away some of the numbness. My friends ordered some kind of fried buns which went in the Chili sauce and added to the yumminess of the whole experience. Cheap Plum Saki which was lovely, some good service and the night was made, The crabs were properly cracked and cooked, everything was very tasty, and there is a plethora of taps to wash up after right outside the door, bibs to protect clothes from splashes of the various sauces. Worth a try, great vibe and you have options to sit in or outside (depending on the Haze and the Heat)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,world class Black Pepper crabs,50,09-16-15,"I remember coming to this restaurant as a kid, another time a few years ago with a friend, and now by choice. Their back pepper crabs is just something that will bring you back to this restaurant every time you are in town. It is made with such an incredible recipe that i could not find anywhere else in the whole world. You will never regret coming to this place even if this was the only thing you will order.The seating areas isn't the best in town but the food is definitely is without no doubt. just try to make sure you book in advance because showing up without a booking might disappoint you as it is always a full house although they have over a crazy number of tables"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crabs I've Had,40,09-11-15,"Strictly speaking, there is one more restaurant that serves equally good pepper crab. That is Keng Eng Kee. But Long Beach is consistent. KEK is perhaps 80% of the time.Coming back to Long Beach, yes, This is the signature dish that you must try. Of course it has other good food, but those are merely good, not outstanding.Chili crab? I think Jumbo at Dempsey Hill does it better."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood!,50,09-02-15,"Wonderful seafood! You won't be disappointed by the food, although I wish it would all come at once and not bring out the vegetable dish when we have almost finished eating everything else!The staff were very welcoming in this occasion and it was great that they shelled the crab for us. Note you get charged 30c for each towelettes you use and $2 for a plate of peanuts that you did not order, and they automatically add 10% service charge, but if you know this in advance then there are no surprises!You cannot beat the seafood here.... I will be back next time I am in Singapore for my next visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili and black pepper crab to die for,40,09-02-15,"I try to make it to Long Beach on every trip to Singapore - at least one time and more if I have the time. It is outstanding. Get the buns to smoother in the chili sauce - YUM! Service can be slow and inattentive (as they are busy) the place isn't that nice, but the crab is great - just go enjoy."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at a historic location with great service.,50,08-29-15,"Great food at a great location with great service, and with a little bit of history. There is a lot on the menu to choose from, and it's hard to go wrong. This is a place you want to put on your ""must do"" list for Singapore, not just for good food, but for the atmosphere. Outstanding seafood. The pepper crab, the shrimp and the sweet/sour fish were excellent. Sitting outside on the veranda in the evening, with the overhead fans going, and a slight cool evening breeze made this seem like a throwback to the old colonial days. (Probably a lot better food today than then, however.) The (relative) cool of the evening made veranda dining a pleasure. And they serve ice cold beer well: in refrigerated mugs. There's nothing like having an ice cold beer on the veranda on a warm evening, while waiting for an outstanding meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Excellent Seafood, lively resturant",40,08-23-15,"We ate twice here during June and August. The fresh coconut juice, salt and pepper prawns, lobster, black pepper crab and chilli crab are all exellent. The atmosphere in the clearly very popular and busy restaurant is very lively. We all thouroughly enjoyed the food. Service seems rather brusque, but the restauant was extremely busy on both occasions. One one occasion we were billed for peanuts we did not have whichwa quickly corrected although with no apology and why in this quite expensive establishment do they charge for hand wipes, essential if you are eating the crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,yummy crab,30,08-22-15,"it's my 2nd time visiting long beach. the restaurant here is not as fancy as the one in east coast. but the pepper grab is still star of the whole meal. crab is large and with lots of fresh meats. it cooks perfectly with super matches with pepper.mango dessert is another icon of this restaurant, but more on visual effect than flavor itself. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To get business relaxed ,50,08-18-15,"Long Beach is absolutely one of the best restaurants after hours of business negotiations. The noisy and busy atmosphere, the beer jug and the job with the crabs keeps your discussions not just in business but helps to get everyone relaxed. You can watch how the experienced waiter pulls the crab apart, don't even try to do it yourself. You are able to watch the fishes to swim in the aquarium which shows how fresh the food actually is. The service, well, don't expect too much of it because the restaurant is full of local people and the waiters are busy to serve those who are loud enough to get the attention. Some junior waiters don't even understand a word of English. Anyway we got very good service and good recommendations also about what to eat. Our menu was meant to 3-4 persons and it costed just some 250 SGD. A jug of Tiger Beer was 27 SGD. We were happy and will go definitely back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Some of the best food i've tasted,50,08-02-15,"The nasi goreng was excellent. So simple yet so good. Love the silverfish and the bean sprouts. The crunchiness was just right with the right amount of sodium that left me wanting for more.The fried kailan with garlic was amazingly perfect. It was soft and crunchy at the same time. Perfect texture. Not salty, not overfried. The cook really knew how to make fried kailan.Chilli crab was delicious. The gravy was cooked to perfection. I should have asked for a recipe."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worst service in history,10,07-28-15,"Wow, expected a lot based on reviews. Place is 100% packed, but service is very poor. We waited and waited for service. Not coming back, ever. Need to at least be friendly, maybe because we are western family? Sorry for coming here, what a let down. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crabs! Crabs!! Crabs!!!,40,07-27-15,"Wonderful local Singapore fare. Had some fresh coconut juice to start then some amazing black pepper crab, chili crab, prawns, and local chicken. Veggies were amazing as well. Lovely dessert of a yam soup and fresh fruit. Make reservations as it gets packed. Sat outside and the breeze was wonderful. Plan on using your hands and being ok with that. Makes eating much easier so if you're ""above"" that sort of thing this isn't for you. Plenty of water bowls and wipes. Very attentive service and great food. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Seafood!,50,07-20-15,"Great Place a bit out of the center. Here they serve seafood from around the world, also Norwegian crabs :). This is one high end place with stiff prices. But really worth a visit. Here one should try their speisalitet Pepper crab and chilli crab. Prepare for a delicious taste experience. But that said, this is not for everyone's wallet."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, great atmosphere",50,07-19-15,"The Dempsey area is a bar and restaurant complex that contains many options. Long Beach is a definite highlight. Although it is hot they offer al fresco dining on the veranda, an inside area and private rooms. How much you like your chilli may determine whether you choose to sit outside.The menu is long and varied. You come here for the crabs of course but our starters of crispy mini-squid, razor clams and sesame prawns were fantastic.We had two crab dishes - in chilli sauce and pepper. You get plastic gloves and a bib to eat this course and you have to dive in with your fingers. The crab claws are as big as your thumb and index finger, meaty and delicious. Both dishes were amazing but for me the pepper crab just edged it - all washed down with ice cold Tiger beer. A great sign that so many Singaporeans eat here, although service may be a bit rough and ready for some! I loved it"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It is All About the Delicious Crabs!,50,07-19-15,"Pepper, White, etc. The outdoor and porch dining is also a plus! The stinky pudding is another thing. A MUST GO destination in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese restaurant,40,07-06-15,"Really nice chinese cousine. Very rich menu and fantastic sea food. One of the best crabs in Singapore that I tasted. Service also very fast and professional.
Place to go back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super delicious seafood cuisine,50,07-01-15,"A big thumbs up for the service and food. First of all, surroundings fantastic. Restaurant set among old colonial buildings in Orchard area. Though a bit remote to reach without a car but a great place to visit to have a totally different feel . Food is super delicious . Crabs are really fresh and cooked to the right texture and taste. A must try is the black pepper crab and the salted egg crab. Though slightly pricey, but it is still worth it. Recommended strongly especially for a great family day out."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for crabs,40,06-24-15,"We had chilli crab, chilli squid with convolvulus (kangkong),clams with hor fun noodles, deep fried marinated baby squid, a special bread (fried man you) to go with the chilli crab sauce and bamboo clams with garlic. My friend ordered the dishes and she is very familiar with the restaurant. Service was average. They tried to give us someone else's dish and we had to remind them about one of our dishes.The food was generally delicious. The dishes were not garnished or presented in an attractive fashion. You can byo wine. Seating includes air conditioned area indoors and al fresco outdoors. The tables are packed closely together. Restaurant is small and it is fairly noisy. Little ambience. Worth going for the seafood itself especially the crab which was meaty. They serve a large variety of crabs, some of which are air flown in from overseas eg Canada"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilli Crabs in Singapore,50,05-31-15,You can't visit Singapore without trying the Chilli Crabs and the best place to get them is Long Beach at Dempsy Hill. I have had them at other places in Singapore but this tops them all. And while you're at it get an order of the razor clams as an appetizer.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach,50,05-30-15,Excellent seafood restaurant on Dempsey Road. Try their freshly boiled king prawns and pepper crab. Delicious.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A great find,50,05-23-15,"Our concierge recommended this restaurant. It did not disappoint. Delicious food, friendly, helpful staff and coeliac friendly. Whole mud crab for $72. The place was full of locals and the food very fresh. Definitely recommended."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab..... Yum!!!,40,05-22-15,"We asked the concierge of our hotel where we could get the best Crab in Singapore. Long Beach Dempsey was the recommendation and we were not disappointed. Not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded!Bustling, full of locals and whilst the service is no fuss the wait staff were happy to take time out to explain the dishes. They took pleasure in your curiosity and enjoyment.Exceptional value for money."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Some tasty dishes, but difficult for a gluten-free diner",30,05-20-15,I have celiac disease and wasn't able to get clear explanations of which dishes are gluten-free or can be prepared that way. I took my chances on chili crab (the server said it had no soy sauce) and greatly enjoyed it. I didn't find much else I could safely eat.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Hot hot hot pepper crab,40,05-13-15,"first time come to this restaurant, we ordered a dinner set for 10ppl, size is big enough, indeed we can't finish all dishes. Black pepper crab is hot and spicy, taste fresh. Curry crab come with fried buns, dip curry, u really want to eat your all fingers. Staff are good service and very sincere. Worth to come with your business partners."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not a Nice Experience,10,05-12-15,When we arrived we stood around to be seated and no one seemed very interested. We were put at a table at the entrance which was windy and unpleasant. The service was shocking. Our food was cold and not at all pleasant. Onto the bill they added extra costs for the peanuts that were on the table and 2 dollars each for paper serviettes. It really was a dreadful experience after having been recommended to us.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,good,40,05-12-15,"all was great. We visit the place every year with my family. I can't wait to get back , next year, hopefully. I reccomend 100%"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilli Crab in Town,50,05-10-15,Chilli crab is a must......dose the sauce with the steam bum. Main dish will feed 3-4 easily. Great atmosphere (outside is better). Service is fast and pacey. An icon to always visit.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Ok food and service, lousy beer lady",30,04-21-15,"We had 3 tables of 10 and ordered a set dinner. The giant clams, pepper crabs and roast chicken were good. Fish, fried rice and mango dessert were ok. Service is mostly fine too. Like some restaurants and coffee shops, the beer is outsourced to a 3rd party and you have these grouchy ladies hawking and serving beer. Near the end of our dinner we stopped the flow of beer which kept coming, since these ladies probably earn commission. Despite our stop instructions , they kept giving us jugs of beer and refused to take them back. Rather annoying. Before we got the bill, we had to speak to the manager to cancel the untouched jugs"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great lunch after our Sunday walk at Henderson Waves,50,04-19-15,"Looking for great crabs to match your wine? Long Beach at Dempsey is super highly recommended...we ordered crabs that were prepared in 2 different ways. Most people would order the famous Chilli crabs with mantou(buns that are either steamed or fried), but what we ordered are crabs cooked in white pepper and the other one with salted egg...it is a ""must try""...we paired it with a great French white..Puligny-Montrachet...what perfect pair...another highlight is their unforgettable Crispy Duck paired with great red wine...it so crispy that you can also chew its bones..no exaggeration... I can go on and on and on...the best thing to do is just visit Long Beach at Dempsey especially when you have foreign guests. You'll never go wrong. Bon Appetite"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab vs Pepper Crab,50,04-06-15,Even though Singapore is famous for Chilli crab ... the pepper crab at Long Beach was awesome .... I think better than the Chilli Crab. We ordered the Pepper Crab and the prawns with chilli crab sauce. Both great but the enjoyed the spicy pepper crab more. Must do. Open till late. One of the few place in Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I like it,50,03-26-15,Got a set meal with lobster and Black Pepper crab the food was delicious and the crab went well with the Erdinger beer. Good atmosphere and service will definitely come back when Income back to Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,authentic seafood in genuine atmosphere,50,03-23-15,"This is a must while visiting Singapore, the seafood is prepared in an unique way-tasty, elegant, not sparing products, simply delicious"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Serious seafood,50,03-18-15,I was invited for Sunday lunch here. Exceptional seafood including sharks fin soup. The chilli crab was mouthwateringly delish and I'm not normally a crab fan.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chinese New Year Eve Dinner,40,02-26-15,This is our favorite restaurant for my family reunion dinner every year for the past 3 years. The food was fantastic on every dishes. Black pepper crabs is a must and never fails us with its consistant quality.The service was good as we were lucky to book a VIP room. The fish and other seafood were very fresh and of course the main lo hei dish also very good!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,a typical tourist place... with great taste of food...,40,02-16-15,"well, if its your first time in singaporeor the first time you about to try the chilli crab, it is a go to place for you..I like the blackpepper crab better than the chilli crab but always love the fried bun that comes along with it tho'..Overall food was great..I dont know about the pricewise because I didnt pay, LOL...But worth to try if you come in a big group."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese seafood restaurant,40,02-04-15,"They have package menu which we took for 5 pax. Cost slight above S$300++ and what we got was prawns, steamed tilapia, roast chicken, a mushroom & veggie dish (i thought this was really good) in some white broth, 2 large chilli crabs with fried mantou, a plate of fried rice and a bowl of yam like dessert. Had a pretty enjoyable meal but would expect a better fish than a Tilapia which they gave us an option to upgrade it to a promfret at a price. We declined so didn't find out how much. Not sure if this is a reasonable price in Singapore but coming from across the border, I thought it was pretty expensive,"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistent seafood quality ,40,02-01-15,"I have eaten Long Beach for a long time. It's always best to have a proper master head chef in the kitchen. I come here once a week for dinner, sometimes more often. The crab quality is usually excellent, whether chilli or black pepper. They have other great dishes, and some seasonal ones too. Call to book in advance, else you will be disappointed as they are usually fully booked. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach Seafood is consistent,40,01-29-15,"I have always liked Long Beach Seafood @ Dempsey. Be forewarned, if you can get out of Long Beach for under $60 per person you have not experienced their black pepper crab or chili crab-and you definitely haven't washed it all down with a beer. I suggest going at lunch as they actually remove the entire crab from the shell. I also like to sit outside on the veranda. This is always an experience. One recommendation--bring your own napkins, towels, and/or go into the restroom and grab a stack of paper towels. These are seriously messy dishes and the restaurant will provide the equivalent of a tissue and wetnap for the end of the meal. BTW-- Long Beach is much preferred to No Signboard and several locals highly recommended Hua Yu Wee on the East Cost for crab which I did not get to."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good for sea food,40,01-18-15,"Recommended for sea food lovers, others find some other place. Crab is the specialty, prawns were good, rice and tofu okay. In January the weather holding, outdoor ambiance is great."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Private room, big round table & big big tasty crab.....",40,01-07-15,"Scrummy delicious food. Beautiful octopus to start, seriously tasty white fish (can't remember the name), and to crown it all a wonderful red chilli crab and a a white pepper crab. We also had some chicken, vegetables, rice etc. Dessert was a mango pudding in a smoking glass which was a real treat too. Just wonderful. The taste, the quality, the quantity - all fabulous. Will be returning to try the black pepper crab too. The service was excellent, many waiting staff and the food came pretty quickly so not too much waiting. A good selection of wines also.Definitely worth a try."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and good service,50,01-06-15,"We went there twice during our trip, recommended by our local friends. The service is great. They are honest with weighing the market price seafood. All dishes are tasty. We like the Razor clams with garlic. The prawns in herbal soup is also good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best black pepper crab in Singapore,50,01-02-15,"I've lived in Singapore for 2.5 years and went on a crab quest (self-assigned) to crown a champion for all preparations of crabs. After extensive (and extremely pleasurable) research, I can say with surety (after 4 visits to be sure of consistency) that the black pepper crab at Long Beach Dempsey is the best in the land.If you want a monster crab (2 kgs or larger), call ahead and reserve the crab when you reserve the table. Otherwise, the crabs will more likely be in the 1 kg range, which is still quite large. Generally, I prefer sitting inside because it can still be pretty hot outside at night.Unfortunately, the fried buns, a Singapore crab staple, are only OK, but you don't really need them with black pepper crab.Other side dishes are great too, but the star attraction is the incredible black pepper crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,For Seafood Lovers,50,12-12-14,"Our friends came from Hawaii which is known for its fresh seafood - but they were completely in awe of the freshness and variety of the seafood we ate at Longbeach. Call ahead and order some of the dishes you like - the Razor Clams, A Steamed whole Fish, Black Pepper Crabs...to name a few!Reservations are a must. And they have big private rooms too. Friendly staff and a bustling place!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood Haven,30,11-25-14,"hi i was dragged by my friends here at Long Beach dempsey hill last September...enjoyed the Chili Crab and the freshness of Lobsters..if you feel bored on weekends and feel like eating anything from the sea., Long Beach is the best place at Dempsey Hill..Well Done"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,over the top,30,11-19-14,"Drunken prawns in a herbal soup broth and bamboo calms is to die for. The warm herbal broth was delicious,. I strongly recommend this to any first-time diners to Long Beach! Disappointed with long beach's seafood at Dempsey. Somehow i think the outlet at east coast is better. The chilli crabs we had didn't seem very fresh, and the sauce was all watery. Black pepper crab was the star of the night. It seems like its targeting more for tourists, Service is so so, fish soup, yes it taste good but very expense.For a restaurant that pride itself with seafood and crab.The crab meat was not firm at all and its claw meat was not body fill,for the price we paid it was robbery on Dempsey road."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Peppered Crab, signature dish?",30,11-18-14,"We had black peppered crab of which the black pepper was so overpowering that we could only feel the texture of the crab meat but not its freshness. The fried clams was only fried with black bean sauce which gave it a monotonous taste. Normally,clams are fried with black beans and chilies to give it some layering in the taste. However, the restaurant was still jammed packed with local families and expatriates. I think people go there for reminiscences on good time with families and friends more than for the taste of the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good place for banquet style dining,40,11-14-14,"It's always easy to be positive when someone else pays, which was the case for this visit. That said, we enjoyed our evening very much. We were a large group (9) in a private room. After the appetizers we moved on to chili crab which was delicious. The accompanying sauce was quite thick and tasty. The large prawns were really very good. We also had a chicken dish and fish, both of which were good. The small bowl of fried rice nicely completed the main part of the meal. Desert was presented in a small bowl placed on top of a larger bowl of green liquid with dry ice so that frosty vapors were pluming from around the mango custard. Quite well presented and fun.I understood that the cost was around S$100 per person including plenty of Tiger beers.Definitely worth a visit, even at one's own expense."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs need to be improved!,30,11-04-14,"Went there for both chilli and pepper crabs. Chilli crabs taste good but pepper crabs are disappointing! It is too oily and wet! Need to review this dish or it is losing customers to Jumbo! In fact, I brought a group of six last week to Jumbo instead of Long Beach!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yummy crab, shelled for you",50,11-03-14,"Serving 500 pax every night, this restaurant is pumping out crab dishes left, right and centre. It's busy, but the service is fast and friendly. We picked this crab restaurant over the others because they will shell it for you- meaning it's not as messy as usual! Lazy, perhaps, but worth it as I don't like eating crab to feel like a work out. The manager showed off the Alaskan crabs (at $800SG a pop), but we settled on a Sri Lankan version. Worth a visit- it's not fancy, but it's a lot of fun. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Chilli Crab!!!!!,40,10-29-14,The chilli crab here is to die for.....just super along with the fried bread rolls. Their fried rice is a must have and the chef's special prawns too. This is the BEST place for chilli crab so don't try any other place.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Disappointment with the ""new Menu C"".",30,10-28-14,"I decided to celebrate a birthday at this venue and selected their “newly created dishes menu, ” Set Menu C. This entitled me and my guests to a private dining room.The room, situated at the end of a long walk through the restaurant, was small, simple in decor, carpeted, sufficiently cold and had good lighting; with thin sliding doors and walls, so that the noise from guests in the other rooms was very audible. Service was attentive and efficient. Below is the list of dishes that came in descending order:Long Sheng live lobster: Each person was served half portions; the lobsters covered in buttery batter. Meaty and rich and had quite tasty flavors. Chili Crab. Crabs in generous amount of tasty tomato-based sauce with the aromas of curry leaves, flavorful and very nice with two plates of fried buns to lap up the chili crab sauce. Buns are additional at $5.50 each plate. Live Prawns in Japanese Sake. We found the presentation unappetizing, looking like the prawns were simply tossed on the plate. The prawns, medium-sized bordering on small, were over cooked, the flesh sticking to the prawn shells.Famous Pepper crab, hot and peppery. One of their signature dishes and a favorite.Steam Live Sea Bass in Lemon Thai style. The fish was very fresh and the meat firm. Strong lemon flavors which I found refreshing. La La King with dried shrimps and chili padi: was a ‘small dish’ in terms both of edible quantity of meat and clams for 10 persons. The sauce tasted similar to the chili crab sauce minus the curry leaves, and the clams tasted fresh.Handmade Bean curd with Chef’s Sauce. The dish was nicely presented, but there wasn’t that Wow! factor to make it outstanding. The sauce was thin and gooey, and wasn’t tasty. A dish that could be missed or skipped.Crispy Duck. We had a huge fat duck, plenty of meat and crispy bits. Fried to perfection. The meat was not dry or too saltish.Country style Brown rice noodles: We found this very saltish. It was compounded by the salted dried shrimps bits making it even more saltish! Not many of us could finish the portions we had.Desert Mango pudding was served individually. It caused a stir because of the presentation in glass vessels containing dry ice in green water, billowing white smoke as the dish was laid on the table! However, the pudding itself was a huge disappointment. Dry and too firm in texture for a pudding. The taste was unremarkable. It was a struggle to finish our deserts!The two plates of appetizers were charged $6.00. Because we had 11 persons and needed an additional lobster, there was an addition of $56.00 for this. The Set Menu C was packaged at $768.00 ++. There are also charges for tea and towel with the usual Service Charge and GST.Generally, a pretty heavy meal, with six out of eight on sea food dishes. I would prefer next time, to go with an ala carte order. There are other sea food dishes in their menu that have been time tested and found to be favorites. This menu could do with a vegetable component and some of the dishes in this new “ Set menu C.” needs, in my opinion, further work to improve on.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved their pepper crab,40,10-23-14,"Slightly smoky like it was off the BBQ added a delicious layer of flavour. Their special prawns were also excellent, eat the shells and even the heads if you are game! Loved it but beware of the price ++ as this adds plenty to the cost."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"not fancy, but good food!",40,10-15-14,"I had my first chili crab @ Long Beach, was finger-licking good.
But what's better were their drunk shrimp soup and coffee pork!!!!
Would love to go back if i am in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not at all impressed.,20,10-09-14,"I never like giving negative reviews but I think it is important for those thinking of having a meal at this place to save their money and time especially as there are so many better and cheaper restaurants to pick from. The food was just there, the service was poor and focused mostly on getting us fed and out in the shortest time. I really advise thinking twice about going to the Long Beach. We got a definite feeling because we weren't locals we weren't really welcomed. As for the chili crab, you will do much better for far cheaper at just about any Hawker stand."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Pepper and Chilli Crab in town,40,10-01-14,"Having eaten at quite a few famous crab restaurants in SGP, i have picked the Long Beach Dempsey's Chilli and Pepper crab dishes as the best among those i have tried.Their 'house special Prawns' is a must try and so is the garlic baby kailan.The presentation of the Mango and Durian puddings looks better than they taste, even with them tasting pretty decent.Def will go again..Visited this place like a 100 times with the most recent being in Aug 2014."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very disappointed,20,10-01-14,If chilli crab is the national dish of Singapore then Long Beach is guilty of unpatriotic acts against the state. At least the crab was super fresh but the dish was quite disappointing. The crab was served covered in a sweetish-chilli-egg sauce which was poorly executed. I think success has ruined this restaurant. I have had much better chilli crab at small hawker stalls and even from my own kitchen. My recommendation is give this restaurant a miss.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good (albeit oily) food, but not great value",40,09-29-14,"The food is quite good - especially the chili crab and black pepper crab, but frankly the leading seafood houses (eg. Long Beach, Jumbo, No Signboard, etc) are exploiting their fame (busloads of tourists or vans full of visiting businessmen descend on them!) to charge very high prices. You can have as good seafood at much lower prices at more out-of-way eateries."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Chilli Crab is ok, Black Pepper Crab will change your life",50,09-23-14,"As per my title....the Black Pepper Crab is simply amazing.
Word of warning. This restaurant is very basic (albeit great food). And bring lots and lots of your own wet wipes and napkins because you will need them."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A Pleasant Surprise,40,09-23-14,The food was great as always but what was surprising was the exceptional service . We were not looking forward to this meal as the last time we were here the service was horrendous . Something must have happened bec the service was faultless. Water n tea glasses were topped up without having to ask for it . Plates were changed between courses. They even offered to peel the crab shells for us ! What a breath of fresh service air !! Well Done Long Beach !!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Chili and Black Pepper Crab,50,09-16-14,Great Seafood Restaurant. The best chili and black pepper crab we had in a long time. All the other dishes we had been all very tasty and yummy. If you are in Singapore it is a must that you try this restaurant out for their great seafood.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tourist Trap - staffs asked additional money for fixed price menu !,20,09-14-14,"I went to this restaurant with my wife on 12/9 . (Table 18 ) we ordered a fixed price menu S$ 138 for 2 persons . We were told by waitress Ms Liao Gun Hui that fixed menu crab is usual weighted 1 Kg but tonight no 1 Kg crab is available . We were told to pay additional S$ 30 for a bigger crab which weighted 1.2Kg . I refused and talked to the Service Manager . She immediately apologized and told us 1 Kg crabs just arrived at the restaurant and is now available at no extra cost . All happened within 3 minutes ! I suggested to the manager to remove the fixed price menu because it is not right for waitress to increase fixed price menu as she likes. I certainly would not pay extra $10 in McDonald for a fixed price meal. Be careful with this restaurant . For me , I will not go back to Long Beach because there are plenty of good and honest restaurants in Singapore . "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Where I will go for authentic chilli and white pepper crab,40,09-12-14,"Love the chilli and pepper crab! Fried baby squids is excellent with beer!
Dislike the queue if you have no reservation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent crab - but it comes at a price...,40,09-04-14,"We had dinner there in late August and we went there for their famous crab of course.The black pepper crab and the red chilli crab were indeed superb, as was the service. We made a reservation for 6 persons but were 10 persons in the end. Even the restaurant was fully booked, they arranged a bigger table for us in no time and service was always friendly and attentive. Though the crabs were really big and succulent, I feel the price was a bit hefty (around 1200 Singapore Dollar). I had excellent crab in a less exclusive setting at much lower prices in Singapore before. Also it was a bit of a let-down that they did not serve stingray, which is a real delicacy in Singapore.Nothing bad about the food or service, but next time I will probaly go to a less exclusive place enjoying similar excellent crab (and stingray!)."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wow is their food ever good!,50,09-02-14,"As a group of six persons we enjoyed their chill crab and pepper crab tremendously. Finger licking good. Also their puddings and jellies for desert, especially the durian one, delicious. Friendly and helpful service personnel, especially when it comes to help us cracking the crabs open. The atmosphere is laid back but attentive service staff who doesn’t mind going the extra mile. Definitely a place to go back to and enjoy more sea food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilly Crab,50,08-23-14,Outstanding service with a smile. The presentation of food aand assistance from servers was great. Worth a repeat!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food with a terrific ambiance.,50,08-17-14,We had chili crabs and pepper crabs at a business dinner. The crab was great. Very good prawn chow fun as well. If the weather is good be sure to sit outside. I like this place.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very good food, neat area",40,08-16-14,"We went here for dinner after a business project and was very impressed. We had chili crab (really good), black pepper crab (really, really good) fresh prawns, some coffee pork dish and some veggies ... everything was really quite excellent!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The kind of place you'd like to get crabs.,40,08-08-14,"Singapore's famous Chilli crab is something you have to indulge in. It is spicy, it is messy, it isn't the cheapest meal out but it is worth every dollar, especially here at Longbeach @ Dempsey, a wonderfully transformed colonial building in lush surrounds. A great laid back spot to watch the live crab tanks, enjoy some cold Tigers and mop up Chilli crab goodness with delicious, sweet fried buns. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious black pepper crabs!,50,08-06-14,"Crabs, prawns, fish... what's not to like? The best black pepper crabs I've had in my life was at this seafood restaurant. It's finger licking delicious! The atmosphere is nice and laid back. The choice of food is wonderful. I'll definitely be coming back here."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Must do in Singapore,40,08-06-14,"This place was so good I went twice in 5 days. Originally taken as a guest of a local, we ordered the house specialty prawn (excellent dish), pork ribs and the famous black pepper crab. All meals were excellent but the crab lived up to the reputation... Went well with a nice cold jug of tiger.Atmosphere is very casual and relaxed and perfect for a warm evening - will be back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab !!!,50,07-30-14,"I went in this restaurant with Colleagues. Our Host ordered for us traditional Singaporean food : Prawns, prawn cake and many other dishes. One outstanding was the Black pepper Crab !!!
It is tasty, spicy but not too much, and kept all the Crab taste"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic crabs,40,07-28-14,The black pepper crabs and chilli crabs were excellent. Be sure to order the buns to soak up the generous amount of gravy that comes with the chilli crab. It gets crowded during dinner on weekends and it would be advisable to make a reservation. Pricey but superbly done and fresh. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crabs-BEST!,40,07-11-14,"Long Beach@Dempsey is one of my favorite restaurants to entertain my overseas friends. This restaurant is very popular among locals and tourists and best to make reservation. It gets really busy during dinner time so be prepared to wait for a table, for walk in customers.I always order black pepper crabs which Long Beach is well known for. A few of my favorite and familiar local dishes are : fried sambal kang kong, roasted chicken, Fried beancurd, sauteed prawns with salted eggs and baby squids. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood,50,07-03-14,"Great place for chilli and black pepper crabs and other Singaporean delights. The food is delicious. Some of the wait staff may not be the friendliest, but worth going."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Different venue, same great food",50,07-01-14,We generally visit Long Beach at East Coast Seafood centre but thought that we would try a different outlet on this occasion. The venue is very interesting - an old army barracks. We sat on the verandah which was very pleasant. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed it very much indeed. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili and Black Pepper Crab,40,06-30-14,"This is actually the second choice by my sis when we visited her. Jambo is her first choice but it's fully book, all the branches!Ordered Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roast Chicken, Beancurb and lala noodles. Crab is big (1kg or so). Very good. Roast chicken is good too! In general, good food.Remember to order dumpling to soak up the chili crab'a sauces!Service wise is good as well. Reservation is a must as this is also popular place."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chili & Pepper Crab Experience in Singapore!!!,40,06-16-14,Having visited Singapore many times and not had a chance to try this must have experience I made sure to tell my friends to put in our must do list this time!!! The toss up was between Jumbo and Long Beach with many friends being either fans of one or the other ….. The one we went to in the end was Long Beach … the Dempsey branch as both Jumbo and Long Beach have multiple branches ….. The Dempsey area in general has really developed into a great area with eateries and cafes bustling throughout the day and the night. The two must have dishes the Chilli Crab with the fried Bread and the Pepper Crab we ordered of course with extra pepper sauce on the side (which you have to order separately to dip the crab in for the full experience). Apart from these two dishes we ordered the butter prawns and the steamed sea bass in soy sauce. The place itself is one of those mass production eateries which have a formula and do large turn arounds and fast service …… The food started to arrive pretty fast and we put on our bib's and picked up the crab cracking utensils and got to work !!!! The Chili Crabs and Butter Prawns came first …. the Pawns were really good and hit the spot …. the Chili crab a bit Challenging to get to the meat for a first timer but once you did was definitely worth the effort. The Fried bun with the Chili sauce was also really really good ….. The Pepper Crab ( we ordered the black pepper …there is also white pepper crab which is supposedly also pretty good) which came had a completely different flavor and the friends kept asking which I liked better …. my answer was i liked the variety both were excellent and the combination was amazing ….. the steamed sea bass with soy sauce was also good but both the crabs being the hands down winners ….. A definitely must do experience in Singapore!!!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"no frills, but good food",40,06-15-14,"The seafood is very tasty and well priced. Service is courteous and prompt. However the setup is very low key - plastic chairs, no bib for covering the shirt etc. If you want tasty good definitely try this."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Gracious Service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng,40,06-14-14,"NIce setting in Dempsey Road. There's a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. Here's what we ordered:1. Steamed Soon Hock - Well prepared and fresh2. Sri Lankan crab - Full and well prepared3. Half chicken - Well prepared4. Poach prawns - Fresh and well preparedCombined this with gracious service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng:1. We were initially allotted a table in a tight space. She moved us to a bigger table when it became available.2. Due to misunderstanding, she allowed us to change our initial order without any fush. Most other places would simply say ""Already prepared"".3. Other staff members are attentive and gracious. Perhaps because of their prominent name tags which provide them with an identity and pride in their work.Overall a great experience. We spent $380 for a party of 5 adults and 2 kids. Would say it is value for money. If the management is reading this, please pass on the compliments to Jenny Cheng and her team."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice seafood,40,06-10-14,"From the iconic east cost place, the Dempsey venue has not lost its original character. chili crab is excellent, the black pepper one also. The diner experience is worht a visit, located on the hills, the outdoor sitting is a lovely experience, perfect for family and friends.A must do visit, to go back to without hesitation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice place for seafoood,40,05-27-14,Nice seafood and ambience. Try the pepper crab. The service was good and they even tried to remove the shells from the crabs for you even if the place was crowded.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper crab,40,05-23-14,"First of all i have to admit i am a little biased as black pepper crab is probably my most favourite dish in Singapore, so most trips for me are excellent. However I have been to long beach many times, at both Dempsey and at the East Coast, and its definitely one of my top choices! Boasted as the 'creators' of the black pepper crab they certainly never disappoint! Its spicy and fresh and always makes for an awesome, fun (and often rather messy) evening dinner. I highly recommend you give it a try and I will certainly continue to keep coming back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chilly Crabs...!!,40,05-21-14,Long Beach is located at Dempsey Hill which was previously the old British Army Barrack. This place is huge with many restaurants to choose from. I particularly like the Black Pepper Crab and Chilly Crab... This is somewhat an achievement for me as I don't usually take crab... :)
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No.1 in seafood freshness,50,05-16-14,"This branch is quite huge. Being in Singapore means having black pepper crab and I was absolutely satisfied. The crab was fresh and meaty and had just enough pepper sauce on it. It was on the dry side but finger-lickin' good! The prawns and the steamed fish were equally fresh and flavorful. The claypot enoki mushroom and cabbage was clean to the taste. For dessert, we had sweet yam paste with ginko nuts, which for me was a little bit too thick. We washed everything down with refreshing Thai coconut juice. Service was exemplary. Will definitely be back! Tip: There'a a playground where kids could have fun while waiting for the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and wonderful service!,40,05-14-14,"Celebrated a loved one's birthday last night at this popular seafood restaurant with some close friends. Gotten a private room that allow us to truly enjoy our dinner without any qualm of disturbing others or being disturbed.Wanted to have both the popular black pepper and chilli crab at the same time, the manager was able to make recommendation that allow us to order the set menu with some changes (with minimal additional cost due to my selection of dishes) to suit our taste bud. Both choices of crabs were delicious and the roasted peking duck was good too especially when they prepared the meat in their recommended cooking style.All of us have totally enjoyed the food and the evening of celebration and catching up.Will definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good food, good ambiance and good service. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black pepper crab, yummmm",40,05-09-14,Having the famous Singapore black pepper crab at thus restaurant is a must. This venue has a vast array of seafood and all of it is very good. Prices are not the cheapest but the quality is worth it.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious Crab,40,05-08-14,May Linn was our amazing server here. Friendly and welcoming. The food especially the black pepper crab was amazing. We also had the crispy duck which was equally outstanding. The restaurant was busy but we got seated within 5 minutes. Amazing experience and right in the centre of Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Much better choice than Jumbo, No Signboard",50,05-07-14,"Excellent 'genuine' seafood from a big chain brand, albeit still easy for tourists to enjoy. Food cooked very well, not just the seafood but the other meat/vegetable dishes as well (which is a good test of the overall quality of the kitchen). The other big chains esp Jumbo are tourist traps with poor food, rude service as they expect most of their guests to not come back. Many locals in contrast come to this branch."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab - a must have when in Singapore,40,05-06-14,"Our friends told we had to go for Pepper crab when staying in Singapore. Based on Trip Advisor and the hotel we reserved dinner for two at the Long Beach. The food was great! The pepper crab was delicious along with asparagus and fried rice. I wish we had bread to soak up the sauce. The only negative was the service was a bit pushy for us to order more dishes than we could eat. There are better set up for groups of four or more. Still, I would go back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I love it!,40,05-05-14,The food and the service is great. The black pepper/chilli crab is delicious. I visit this institution almost every time we visit Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly!",50,04-29-14,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly! The 2 of us arrived without a reservation but was given a table for 90 minutes. Fair enough.. Food was amazing and worth the rushed experience :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab de luxe,40,04-17-14,"Local expat recommended this place, and it is absolutely worth it! We did not have a reservation, but got a table by ourselves on a separate terrace, and still decent service. We had the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab and plenty of beer. Great taste and great fun. Kids played around us and the night was great. Bring your own napkins!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood Place But Expensive,30,04-01-14,"Family of 5 went to try again, but, it has become more expensive this time round.We had:-1) Chilli Crab And Pepper Crab...The pepper was better Than The Chilli.2) Kai Lan Veggie...Nicely Done.3) Frog Legs - Fried With Chilli And Garlic...Portions Were Small.4) Beef Stew...Beef Was Very Tender.5) Fried Rice.On the whole, it was nice, especially the Beef Stew. The Chilli Crab was a bit of a disappointment. Service was good. Even though we had to request for drinks more than once. It saw a full house the evening we went."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab never eaten among South East Asia,40,03-23-14,It was my best place I ate a very good crab in Singapore @ Long Beach 'Dempsey' & among the South East Region!I really enjoyed the place.Very well known / Famous place !!The service is quiet good and followed within time but sets order by order!Anyway I really enjoyed eating my Crab from Sri Lanka !
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Lively place,40,03-11-14,"Big crab, if seafood is your thing, then this place is somewhere to visit. The live crabs and fish are really interesting and entertainment for the kids. Very busy, Book in Advance!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good food, but expensive",30,03-09-14,"Went with a few friends and for starters we had the prawn and chicken dishes. The prawn was great, good size and well seasoned. There was nothing special about the chicken. For mains we had pepper crab, chilli crab, spicy steamed fish and a mushroom dish. The pepper crab was outstanding and everything else was good except the chilli crab which was very average and I thought sweet rather than chilli. The bill for 5 of us was just over sd1000 incl a few jugs of beer. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,What an experience!,40,03-06-14,"A friend who had lived in Singapore suggested this place to us. And what an experience! We had pepper crab, which was divine and baby squid which was amazing! Coming from a country where seafood is plentiful I was skeptical about the outcome but this place really rocks. The restaurant was fully booked as people were still celebrating chinese new year but service was impeccable. Try to get in early to enjoy the scenery as well and avoid the queues. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,the peper crabs are back!,40,03-02-14,The Sri Lanka peper crabs are just excellent. The location is nice : the large terrace is quiet. This iconic restaurant is quit expensive. Try it if you can afford it.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No crabs? Fail!,10,02-26-14,"We booked a table for 8.30pm on Saturday and would you believe they ran out of crabs by then?! When we were being seated, they told us ""we have run out of Sri Lankan crabs"", implying there were other shellfish but when we were ordering, they didn't have anything at all, not even lobster! If we had known there was no shellfish, we would have gone somewhere else!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Old Style Singapore Seafood - the Best,50,02-17-14,I've been a follower of this Long Beach branch since its heydays at Marina South. I will not go to another restaurant for seafood unless I have no choice. Their signature dish is the black pepper and chili crab. Their latest creation of soft and crispy hor fun is great.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,iconic singapore restaurant,40,02-09-14,"going to Long Beach is one of the must-do things for any visitor to Singapore. there is also another brand but this is convenient since it's in town.the chilli crab and pepper crab are both amazing. something that every visitor has eaten. and must eat. apart form other dishes, these are the 2 that I order every time I go there.if you haven't visited long beach, then I suggest you do so - you will not regret it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab with mantou craving satisfied!,40,02-07-14,"Been craving for chili crab with mantou so had to come and eat here. As usual place is full packed because it's CNY week and i think also the reason why their crabs this time were smaller. We also ordered the pepper club and the cereal prawn. I would say, my craving was satisfied. Had a cool white wine that went with it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab,30,02-04-14,"I was told pepper crab originated here. It wasn't as good as the other place in terms of taste. The crab we had wasn't fresh.
Other dishes were alright but the food in general was overpriced!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Singapore food,40,01-20-14,"A friend took me to this restaurant to have lunch this afternoon while I am visiting Singapore. Good food being served there. Very authentic. I went there in the evening with my wife in the evening in the same day. We has deep fried oyster and lobster. Very well prepared food. If there are four of you, I would suggest ordering a crab dish. A lot of visitors around is ordered this dish but since there were just two of us, we ordered lobster."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must on a Singapore visit,40,01-19-14,"A friend introduced me to Long Beach and I recently visited with colleagues. I'd been building it up all day and the food and staff didn't disappoint.We started with the geoduck clam sashimi and soup bowl, followed by mango chili grouper (which would be my last meal on earth), chilli crab & black pepper crab. All were out of this world. Only downside was the noodle dish which was a little gluey. Staff were very attentive and friendly without being pushy.That being said, it was pricey and we'd probably be a bit more reserved on the next visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Signature Singapore Chilli Crab,40,01-09-14,"This long established seafood restaurant has this outlet in an old colonial style bungalow opposite the Botanic Gardens. There is live seafood displayed in water tanks. All seafood dishes are nice, particularly the famous Chilli Crab--a must try !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To complete my 3.5-day trip in SG,40,01-01-14,Disappointed by our visit to Jumbo the very first evening me and my hubby decided to try out probably one of their biggest rivals before we leave. Eventually got the chance today on our final day here and we are so pleased that we did. The staff were very friendly and proactive making suggestions being very flexible so we ended up with a set meal for two with chilli crab instead of black pepper and additional buns for dipping :)) the crab was really good and my hubby's favourite was the noodle which can't remember the name. Dessert came out with really cool presentation and we both stuffed n couldn't finish it all as it was a big meal probably enough for 3! Overall very good dining experience and would highly recommend. However there is always room for improvement...such as offering some bigger napkins to cover the front...also the ladies needs some serious refurbishment! 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab? Keep Looking...,10,11-22-13,In a country full of great restaurants - this one helps to bring down the standard. I am a single business traveller that's been in Singapore for two weeks and have been impressed every day but at the Long Beach at Dempsey. The only thing worse than the Chilli Crab was the service. No follow up by the waitstaff - the Captain had to take my order. I sat for nearly 20 mins before someone asked if I would like my check - no interest in whether I'd be interested in dessert. A true disappointment. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,50,11-19-13,"Had a recommendation from a friend from Singapore that when in Singapore we should all go to Long Beach Restaurant at Dempsey. Well we did and as there was 6 of us we all fought it all to get as much of the Black Pepper Crab as we could. yea it was GOOD. Very Peppery but isn't that how it was meant to be. Great Service, cold drinks, good food, and restaurant was packed (which always tells you something) What more could you ask for."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best seafood Chinese,40,11-10-13,"Nothing to complain about, brilliant service quality Chinese food beautifully prepared and, when you order fish such as Sea Bass you see it whole cooked prior to it being shared out in bowls for each diner. We were six plus a toddler. Beers plus softs plus a bottle of ok wine plus food service and gst 300 dollars. Good I'd say "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent!,40,11-10-13,"What a difference getting a private room makes! We had a party of 10 this time, and the service in an air conditioned room was exceptional. Food is perfect, as always, prooer crab to die for, and the rest to match. There was a snag with the restaurant running out of bibs, but they came to the rescue with some linen towels that perfectly protected our light shirts from flying cracked crab parts."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food and service has long has a beach.,50,10-27-13,"What a spread of sea food. From Jeo duck to alaskan crabs. You take a fixed meal and you are served with a whole spread. Dont miss the black pepper crab, it was out standing. Oh don't forget the mango pudding with the dry ice smoke. What an effect. Over all an excellent. Good meal not to forget. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, weird service",30,09-29-13,"Can't go wrong with chili prawns, pepper crab, steamed garoupa and a great outdoor table and beer on a Saturday night. Love the fact that they peel and shell the fish for you so you don't even have to get messy as before. Only thing, can they ask servers who are obviously sick to stay home, instead of hacking their germs into my food as they prep it? Is that too much to ask in a civilized Sngapore?"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tremendous seafood with Friends,40,09-13-13,"I enjoyed dinner with nine Chinese colleagues at an outdoor table. The staff did a good job accomodating a few last-minute friends joining us. The food was served family style and we had a great time. We had one of the multi-course prix fixe menus, along with a few additions. Black pepper and white pepper crab, fish, noodles, rice and veggies - all presented well and very flavorable. Enjoyed coconut juice served in the coconut."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome chilli and pepper crab,50,09-07-13,"It is about 10 years since we left Singapore and moved to Europe, and we have missed the chilli crab and black pepper crab at Long Beach, their Dempsey location being new to us.We had a chance to revisit it tonight and it was wonderful.Peppery, tangy, buttery and spicy, rich flavours that cover your taste buds, hands and chin, with rice buns to soak up the sauce on the chilli crab, balanced with various Chinese greens and all washed down with a jug of Tiger beer ... Bliss !I specially brought a shirt of many colours to handle the inevitable splashes, but the staff kindly provided us with large bibs.Service was attentive and helpful, and the area which was the old army barracks when we lived here, has been transformed into a host of different restaurants and food types for all tastes and budgets.It was even better than we remembered."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved the seafood here!,50,08-28-13,"OMG, the chili crab and pepper crab here were absolutely amazing. Fantastic. I could have eaten every meal at this restaurant. My h travels on business to Singapore - and his Chinese speaking work colleagues took us here for dinner. Dempsey is a great little area full of busy restaurants, fun to walk around. There was quite a line at the restaurant - luckily for us, the colleagues got there well ahead of us. And ordered. I don't know what they put in their chili crab but it was addictive. Totally addictive. I wish I could make that at home. Black pepper crab was also great. We had the spare ribs which were very flavorful and had a beautiful texture. One of our hosts ordered a whole coconut as a drink - which seemed unusual but was actually pretty tasty. Just be careful to get the right utensil to dig out the coconut - or you might end up wearing the coconut milk!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper & chilli crab,40,08-18-13,"The crab was extremely fresh, cooked to perfection with tasty sauce.
Tip: Be sure to ask for the weight of the crab before you order, as the price is market price set for that day. Otherwise it could become expensive."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistently good,40,08-10-13,Every few years we visit Singapore and this place is always on our list. It never fails to deliver the best Sri Lankan Popular Chilli Crab dish with bread--over 1kg for S$68. You don't need anything else---well maybe a Tiger Beer or two!!!!!! Sit inside in the air-conditioning.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab and Chili Prawns,40,08-03-13,"My husband travels to singapore frequently, so when I got the opportunity to join him he said we had to come to Long Beach Seafood on Dempsey Road for the black pepper crab. I really loved the area around the restaurant and the food was really amazing. The seafood is so fresh it's swimming in tanks before you order it. Was quite busy on a Thursday night, and reservations are highly recommended, although we found that the locals were given priority over everyone else regardless of reservation or not. When we were sat it was at a very odd table in the corner by the front door, and we waited over 45 min for someone to come over to take our food order. We flagged down the hostess, who was very apologetic, and she got someone to come over and take our order right away. Despite this, I think the locale and the food were well worth the wait."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,40,07-12-13,"Was there with my colleagues from all over the world (26 of us) last night. Service and food was good, but a bit pricey especially the drinks and beers. The seafood was freshRecommended dishes and my favourite were:-1. The steamed live prawn2. The steamed live spring water golden phoenix Fish in Sintang style3. Famous Black Pepper crab - crab was fresh, but i didnt like the strong pepper taste4. Fried you-tiao with fresh crab meat and minced live prawn5. Supreme roast chicken"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great for crab!,40,07-02-13,Chili crab was great! One tip would be to go all out and use your hands! Ask for a bib as it can get messy. Also had the beef with chili which was very good too.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,BEST LONG BEACH I've ever visited ever!!!,50,06-17-13,"Good:-Staff are professional & helpful!-Staff do not upsell.-Outdoor seating is good, despite the heat.-The annex has ample sitting space.Bad:-Main entrance has limited aircon tables.-Not possible to accept last minute reservations, due to high traffic.-10% rebates given if you are a member."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Decent crab...Not so decent servive,30,05-23-13,"As a huge seafood lover I was dying to try the famous crab on offer at Long Beach. I was not completely disappointed but not overly enthralled either. Inviting some friends visiting from Sydney to dine with us we reserved a table outside. On arrival we were greeted by a cacophony of noise from the incredibly crowded dining room and were relieved to escape to the relative calm of the outdoor seating. Once we were able to locate a waitress we ordered a staggering amount of dishes (we were all super starving). Crab, lobster, prawns and other sea dwelling delights were ordered in abundance. It was probably a good thing we did order so much as from that point on all the serving staff seemed to disappear. We would have had a tough time requesting any more dishes. Anyway, on to the important bit...the food. Some dishes were borderline delicious others a little more mediocre. Stand outs included the famous black chilli crab and wasabi prawn. To be perfectly honest though I have had much better.All in all Long Beach at Dempsey definitely has an air of mass production and tourism about it and the service leaves a lot to be desired! I would eat there again but I believe this restaurant may have had it's hey day."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab.... more more more,50,05-22-13,This was a recommendation from someone who eats here regularly. Thank you so much. Get a cab and visit when in Singapore or if like us you are on a stopover between flights. Chilli Crab and Black pepper crab to die for. The wine list is not bad and if you are staying in a Singapore hotel will seem like a bargain. Will stopover again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wonderful typical place for the pepper crab!,40,05-21-13,Very typical restaurant well located in Dempsey Hill. Very convenient place as you can find a lot of bars in the same quarter to go after dinner. The pepper crab is just perfect and you have a lot of choice of dishes. The service is very typical too and it's sometimes difficult to be understood if you don't speak Chinese. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Convenient location, food tasty, service ok",30,05-21-13,"We couldn't reserve a table with the competitor as they were full (on a Monday night) however this restaurant was recomemded to us and they weren't full, maybe 50% full. The pepper crab, spinach and tri egg dish, seafood noodle were all very tasty and the price was reasonable. However the service was pushy when taking our order and then at times slow when we needed more tea and napkins for the messy (but delicious) crab. I felt more like we were in a process to be fed rather than out for casual / relaxed meal with friends. I would return as the food was good but I'd be firmer with the staff to ensure we weren't ""proccesed"" but rather served and indulged. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood in town,50,05-14-13,"It may not be possible to get to eastcoast all the time. Dempsey is turning into an upmarket wine and dine area. Long beach keeps it's menu at affordable prices similiar to it's eastcoast branch. The food is excellent. Outdoor seating is nice but there isn't really a view. The restaurant is very popular with tourists, business visitors and locals. Reservations are highly recommended. For those of you who enjoy Durian, there is a Durian stall near the open car park near the entrance of Dempsey road. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cheesy tourist trap,20,05-06-13,"Don't fall for this one - despite the concierge's best efforts to convince me that locals still come here, my insticts told me otherwise. Should've gone with the gut as the food was mediocre and service even worse. Have a feeling that chili crab can be had at a better value and quality elsewhere. Anywhere but Long Beach @ Dempsey!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood at dempsey,30,04-20-13,"Comveniently located at dempsey so you don't have to go all the way to east coast to eat the same thing. Crowded on a thursday evening, so business is bustlingWe ordered a set menu as there were 20 of us. Started with bamboo clams with a good amount of garlic. Then there was fried fish with sweet sour gravy, average stuff. The crispy skin chicken is usually popular. Then the main event, pepper crabs, which were good. The carbs was spicy malay noodles mee goreng, which was tastyOverall it was ok, as it's so mass produced these days as it's tough to rate such a joint as exceptional"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chilli Crab!,50,04-14-13,The restaurant was very busy but the staff were helpful and efficient. We didn't have a clue what to order having recently arrived in Singapore but the waiter (Jeff) helped us and we a lovely meal and memorable evening out - we have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food - Service,40,04-11-13,Good restautrant and great variety of Seafood including Fish through to Alaskian King Crab..Reasonable price as wellFound sitting inside a little noisey so would suggest you sit outside if you want volume at a normal level.If you want the Private rooms make sure you boook in advance as we missed out
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper or Chili Crab so many decisions!!!,40,04-09-13,"Plenty of other food to choose if Crabs not your thing, but they do have one of the best in Singapore. They also will crack the crabs and get the meat out to save you the hassle. But the taste of either Black Pepper or Chili is a Singapore must try. I've tried it in other countries and it is still better in Singapore.Fried rice was a bit on the greasy side. But the fried green beans are fabulous! Reservations are needed for dinner any night of the week, lunch is easier to go in without a reservation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worth the visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey,40,04-09-13,"It was an adhoc decision to try out the chilli crab at Long Beach. There were no tables available when we reached there and we had to wait for about 25mins or so for our table, we were a bit agitated at first due to the long wait. However the moment we were seated, the service was excellent, we were approached by this lady call May Lim to order and she's so considerate to ensure we don't over order since there were only 4 of us. We ordered the famous chilli Sri Lankan crab, deep fried squid, stir fry baby kailan and a simple fried rice. The chlli crab was excellent! It's my first time tasting Singaporean chilli crab and it's really really delicious and the crab meat was solid, perfect dish to go with the fried mantou. Even the deep fried squid was really good too. The supervisor May Lim will check with us whether the food is good and ensure everything is ok, very good service indeed. Will definitely recommend people to try out this place."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood location,40,04-04-13,"If you want to have a good selection of seafood with a decent quality in Singapore, choose this restaurant. We really enjoyed it for the second time now, especially the crabs (chilly and black pepper) . It's nice to sit outside, do not have to suffer from air condition. Service is good, prices I guess average for restaurants in Singapore, but the food is really worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Crabs were great, but service not so much",30,03-25-13,"Went to this highly rated establishment, and as the crabs were tasty, we couldn't get service once our dishes were delivered. We asked for extra napkins as the dishes are quite messy, and she acknowledged with a nod but that was the last we saw of her. They neglect to tell tourists that EVERYTHING is EXTRA as we found out when the bill arrived. The dish of peanuts they bring when you sit down, the wet napkins they give you, and the bread with the crab dishes are all unexpected charges! Then we find out that there is a sink with paper towels in the middle of the restaurant outside that regulars are obviously aware of, but no, we ask for extra napkins and get charged! If I'm paying that much for the crabs, I at least expect better service. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Disappointed,30,03-22-13,We thought we would try Long Beach as we had been in Jumbo the week before and wanted to try a different seafood restaurant. But we were disappointed in the food. The seafood hor fun that we ordered arrived in a lump and look very unappetising and didn't taste any better. The sharksfin soup was missing the sharksfin! Most of the food that we ordered was of a poor quality and the service was also rather poor. If you are thinking of having seafood in the Dempsey area I would suggest that you go to Jumbo and give Long Beach a miss as they are more expensive and the food quality is poor.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Unhealthy environment,10,01-24-13,"Air conditioned restaurant filled with smoking incense. Huge turn off. Food was not cheap, but standard was somewhat above average. Nothing to shout about though."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Spent S$1,300+ here but would not give this place a second chance",20,01-12-13,It was a family dinner for 8 adults and 3 children celebrating father-in-law's birthday.Chose this place as it was well-known for their seafood. We had a room but it was poorly maintained and rather cramped.Cutlery was not thoroughly cleaned with stains on almost all the pieces we were given. Terrible ...We ordered a set which costs more than a $1K but the fish was undercooked and had to be returned for 'additional rework'.Other dishes were ok but certainly not fantastic for the price paid. The overall experience is mediocre in terms of service. Certainly not somewhere we will patronize again..
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great Crab, but Service could have been better",40,01-09-13,"Went there just before the New Year as we had visitors from Oregon. We have been to Long Beach Dempsey at least 5-6 times in 2012 and the food has never disappointed. We also like the more laid-back feel of the entire Dempsey area, an area we frequent constantly.Black-Pepper Crab : Finger Licking GoodBamboo Clams in Garlic : AwesomeSteam Prawns : Very fresh, hence the lack of need for any condimentsCuttlefish Dough Fritters : A little greasy, but was goodFried Noodles : Good flavorFresh Mangoes for Dessert : Wolfed down in a blink of an eyeNo visit to Singapore is complete without a Singapore Seafood Meal, and Long Beach is the place we will always take our guests to."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab- gives you a reason to live!,50,01-06-13,"If Moliere is correctly quoted by Samy, the South Indian eatery nest door ( see reviews) he probably was thinking of the Black Pepper Crab at Long Beach. They claim to have invented the dish, but if that is a stretch they certainly did perfect it. This is one of Singapore's iconic dishes, deservedly so. I come here for crab and only Black PepperbCrab. No starters, no side dishes, just delectable crab washed down with a jug or two of Tiger.Come here, or to the original location at East Coast Parkway. You'll be thankful you did."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous local seafood restaurant in Singapore,40,12-25-12,"I usually went to other seafood restaurant in East Coast or No Sign Board in Singapore.Latest trip to Singapore about 10 days ago, had a group dinner with colleagues at Singapore office after company business meeting. Haven't heard of this previously, but it was worthwhile visit if you are a big fan for famous Singaporean black pepper crab or curry crab.I have to say it was a finger licking great meal that I would surely visit again :-)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worst Experience Ever,10,12-09-12," My husband and I love to eat out regularly and we know when the food is superb, good or simply bad. Upon our arrival, with reservations, we were given a huge table for six and seated next to the glass wall which we could physically see our neighbors eating and vice versa. The lady who took care of our table did not know english so it was quite frustrating to get around with the different items on the menu. We finally settled for simpler items, prawns and fish. The prawns came in first very nicely presented and large but the taste was terrible. It seemed it was boiled in sea water and rather raw. The sauce that accompanied it was not too bad to relieve the after taste of the sea water. When the fish came in, we had requested a fried red snapper, it looked like a small fried coy!! This was even worse. My husband just had a few bites of this and had to leave it as it was full of tiny bones. To drink, my husband had a coke and I had a glass of wine. You can't go wrong here but to pay the price for a bad glass of wine surely hurts. The cost in wine was 19.00 for a glass!! The cost of the overall dinner was $128.65!! A big ripoff for what we got. We are used to pay on occasions $400 for two with no regrets if the food was exceptionally good. So the price for dinner is not an issue for us. There are no napkins on the tables to be seem. They only give you wipes and no utensils. You basically eat with your hands if you do not know how to eat with chop sticks and if you run out of wipes and ask for more, you are charged for it!! For sure we will not return. The prices for the food and ambience is not worth it. The only good thing to remember was that they were able to call a taxi for us and this came very fast. We did not have to wait to leave!! Thank God and good riddence. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Get the Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab!!!,50,12-04-12,This is a must visit while you are in Singapore - the Pepper Crab and Chili Crab are simply the best here. Service is a whirlwind but efficient. This place just does it right. Feel free to put on the cheesy apron and dig in!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing meal,50,11-28-12,"We had an absolutely fantastic meal at Long Beach. From the soup - crab sweet corn - to the honey chilli chicken and everything else we ate - it was just fantastic Special mention to the pepper crabs and the oysters. Oh my god ! The next time I am in Singapore, I know where my first meal will be ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper and chilli crab,40,11-25-12,"A jug of tiger beer? A few crabs? And a nice relaxed balcony. What more can you ask for?We ordered 2 crabs, a black pepper and a chilli. Both were amazing, the vote was split but best vote went to the black pepper. We almost ordered the Alaskan king crab (deadliest catch style) but at $600 we decided otherwise. also had some bok choy, prawns and some donut bread things that went very well with the chilli crab sauce. No one was hungry afterward, always a good sign for a crab house. A must do for seafood eaters when visiting Singapore. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Only for grab,40,11-10-12,"Can't really comment on any other dishes than the grab in black or white pepper sauce or with chilli but that has been my reason to re-visit the place for many times.Imported grab is quite expensive but since the visits have only been on special occasions, it has been worth the money.The service is propably not the most efficient and despite always reserving in before hand the reservations have been lost or not in particular section of the restaurant (on patio) but usually the confusion has been solved and the over all experience has been good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Spicy, in the heart of Singapore; If that's what you are looking for, this is the place",40,10-28-12,"This place is an Esau one to access without suffering the heavy traffic jams towards the East Coast, and food is as good. And food can be very spicy too, for those who love chilli crab and pepper crab and the likes, this place does meet expectations. The area at Dempsey hill makes it a pleasant venue to have dinner and move afterwards to another place for a drink and perhaps a bit of live music.The sits outside on the balcony are pleasant, no air con however served by fans. It is perhaps a better location than inside, as you feel the age of the place much more."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fresh seafood, but . . .",30,10-13-12,"We went to Dempsey Hill to try the seafood at Long Beach. First, we didn't make any reservation so we had to wait a while; also, without the reservation, I guess, we didn't get to have the good tables. They placed us in the lower 'deck', where lighting was poor. Furthermore, behind our table were what looked to be storage for dirty plates... it marred the already dark ambiance. We ordered the popular dishes - black pepper crabs, buttered prawns, fried kangkong with cuttlefish. While we waited for the food, they handed out a small of peanuts which was not bad at all. When the food came, they looked lovely (sadly, twas just dark for me). The black pepper crabs were huge, but I have tasted better versions. The buttered prawns tasted really fresh. The kangkong with cuttlefish was very spicy; I would suggest you avoid this unless you are really used to 'hot' and spicy dishes. The staff were attentive. All in all, I had hoped they kept their standards by maintaining the same bright environment all through the eating areas. It would have made a lot of difference in our dining experience.As tourists, we came to Dempsey Hill via the taxi; after dinner, we found out twas quite hard to get a ride back to the hotel, so we walked down the road to where Dempsey road exits. There we saw a small stand near a wide parking space. here was a man whose only trade was to serve durian fruit. As we were curious, we sat down one of the stools and ordered for a sweet durian fruit (you can choose sweet, bitter sweet and bitter)... it tasted really good! it didn't have a strong smell (the taxi driver told us, the riper, the less odor), and the man offered disposable hand gloves! I would suggest you end your seafood dinner with this fresh sweet treat!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best View in Dempsey,50,10-11-12,"It is the large deck that largely makes this Seafood eatery better than its nemesis inside. The seafood is equally good, and the seating choices are more varied. Try the salted fish fried rice."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,So good!,40,09-21-12,"Crab was Outstanding, as were the noodles and vegetables. Paired with some Tiger, it was a perfect meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not so good,30,09-16-12,"When we visit Long beach@ Dempsey i was a little bit disappointed because i am expecting that the food was really excellent. since it was my friend who recommend me to come to this place. so from bukit timah we drove here to Dempsey. they're popular of Black pepper crab, but that night i just want to have a prawns,chicken and the noodles.. the food presentation was ok, the staff is a little bit snobbish but its ok because it was busy at that time. so here it goes when we are about to eat the food i was shock and confused about the food that we order. Do we order food or MSG? all the food is full of MSG. we couldn't even finished our food.i need to drink a lot of water to clear my whole mouth and throat. but still the after taste of the MSG is still there. it lingers into my system. I think i should listen to my friend that i should try the Crab only."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best Chili Crab with mantou and Cereal Prawn!,40,09-11-12,"I had the best crab this trip, I can't get enough of the chili crab with mantou that you dip in the gravy, the cereal prawn is the best! With white wine, our meal is the best. It is so much better that they renovated and we were given a table outside.. Nice ambiance.."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best pepper king crab ever!,50,08-28-12,"Do you want to try to eat a huge crub? well this is the right place!1kg crab for few euros. We went there in 7 people. we ordered 5 king crab, 2 portions of prawns, 3 portions of oysters, wine, beers, dessert. In total we spent around 60€ each. Not cheap, but if we would have eat the same in europe the price would have been at least the double."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Succulent Crabs,50,08-24-12,Hosted a party of eight to a wonderful seafood dinner. The chili and black pepper crabs were plump and sweet. The frog legs perfectly spiced with a touch of garlic and the sea bass steamed in Thai seasoning melted in your mouth. Staff very attentative with ice cold mugs for the Tiger beer. Outstanding
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Atmosphere,40,07-24-12,Sat out side on a balmy evening. Very attentive staff who managed our large group well. Good chilli crab and a variety of spicy chicken dishes and accompaniments. Mid range for prices for food and alcoholic drinks. An enjoyable evening.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab in town,50,07-20-12,"The whole package is simply excellent. The food, service and location are reason why its for me the best crab restaurant in Singapore. There might be better place for the food somewhere at a street place, but the location and the staff cannot be beaten. Very recommendable."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood! Chilli crab is top notch!!,40,07-19-12,"Dempsey is a fun location to visit for a drink and Longbeach the perfect place for dinner with family or friends. Promises a fun night out! Drinking beer, eating chilli crab... A wonderful summer night. The recommended special prawns were tasty, the vegetables pleasing and the chilli crab a standout. Great dining experience!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delectable,40,07-17-12,"This is a seafood restaurant about 10 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road. It specialises in mudcrab, with chili or black pepper. Make a booking and get there before 6.00pm as it is very popular with the locals. It is not a food hall place so please dress respectably. It standards and quality are way above places like Newton Circus which is living off its tired old reputation for seafood. Dont waste your time going there.It has a mainly outdoors setting and you would think you were in a national park as it is so quiet.The seafood was delectable and we concentrated on the chili and black pepper mudcrab dishes.You wont be disappointed."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood lovers' paradise in a central part of Singapore .,40,06-07-12,"Menu includes lobster, Live Tiger Sea Mantis with Spicy Salt and Pepper, Live Drunken Prawns with Brandy & Herbal Soup, BBQ Live Nilotica Red Fish, Renowned Crispy Duck, Claypot Live Marble Goby and best of all is the crab dish which is served in many varieties including the popular chilli crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab is the Best in town!,50,06-01-12,"We headed over to Dempsey Hill for some famous Singaporean Crab. Dempsey Hill is basically a village of sorts filled with restaurants, a few bars, and some shops catering to expats. We heard that the Long Beach Restaurant served up “the original and the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore”. How could we go wrong? We ordered that along with a couple side dishes. Their Black Pepper Crab was phenomenal!! So spicy, so messy, and perfectly proportioned! I highly recommend this place. http://www.internationalnabers.com/2012/05/25/great-beers-found-in-singapore/"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just as good as ever ...,50,04-25-12,"This was my favourite restaurant when I worked in Singapore a few years ago. At that time it was in Marina Bay, now it has moved to Dempsey Road. It didn't disappoint. The friendly staff, excellent service and brilliant food were all in evidence as they had been previously."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Standard Dropped!!!!!!Horrible Food....,10,04-03-12,"It was last Saturday night at around 11pm , we were a group 12 people. We ordered sizzling beancurd which was prepared differently from the usual style. The cereal prawns were stale. The steam fish was served overwhelmingly with garlic.We also ordered pepper crab, keow teow and 2 other dishes. For desserts we ordered pudding which tasted very ordinary. Overall, it was a bad experience and will not return to Long Beach which was our favorite seafood restaurant earlier. The quality and standard dropped drastically. Very disappointing...."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,As good as Jumbo if not better...,40,03-25-12,"The bet is on. Longbeach or Jumbo serves the best pepper crabs? Either way, customers WIN. Long Beach has a more laxed feel when you eat as its dining areas are in the main aircon restaurant, on the verandah (outdoor but with a roof) or just below the verandah (outdoor in brollies). Going to dinner give your guests a feel of working up an appetite as they climb up the little hill of about 30 steps. Thanks."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great experience,40,02-26-12,"We had been told to have Chilli Crab when in Singapore. Long Beach @ Dempsy was quite close to our hotel and reception recommended it as being good sea food. We were not disappointed. It is a very busy atmospheric restaurant and we thankfully booked before we went. They did say they only had garden tables left but when we arrived we were offered a table indoors which we decided to take. The service was excellent and the waitress very kindly helped us with the menu, which we found rather confusing. She gave suggestions and made sure that we didn't over order, which is so easy when you are not sure of portion sizes. All the sea food is completely fresh coming out of tanks. We had the house speciality prawns, suger pea shoots in garlic followed by the Chilli Crab and fried buns, a kind of sweet bread. We drank bear because the wine was too expensive."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fun atmosphere, informal style",40,02-25-12,"Nice informal setting in which to kick back. Good food, efficient but not terribly friendly service. Chili crab the star!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Freaky expensive and dishonest,10,02-22-12,"We came for a professional dinner. The Chinese maid had inaudible English. She gave advices on our menu, changing it five times without we requested it. At the end, for 6 persons, the bill amount was 1100 SGP dollars. They charged napkins, deserts separately from menu and so on... INSANE"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach in Dempsey is terrible!,10,02-22-12,"We were group of 7-8 colleagues, who dine at this restaurant last night 21st Feb. We had the most ""horrific"" time when the bill was presented. The Manager who took the order had the tendency of making the customer to pay a fortunate for a food that is so common in singapore. we were recommended a set menu for 6-7, with about 10 dish (that no one on this planet) could finish or eat, and we ended up with a big bill and waste of lots of food. perhaps this restaurants does not appreciate the wastage of food, but one should never recommend to ""customers"" who are not singaporean or local a list of food that is so costly. we had to pay SGD1111 for 6 people! They even charged us for wet towels, and SGD6 for diet coke! What a rip off. Take my pick, i have lived in singapore for 3 years and this is the first time i have had a bad time in a seafood restaurant. And this will be the FIRST and the LAST time we will go there. The Manager of the restaurant was not helpful, he did not even explain how we ended up with such a big bill. The FOOD was normal and i am 100% sure i could have got better in another place for a less amount of money we had to pay. Take our advise, never go to this place, you will have a big hole in your pocket and a shock to your system."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,This is the place to try Chilli Crab!,50,02-21-12,If your in the mood for seefod and want to try Chilli Crab (or Black Pepper Crab) this would be the place I'd recommend.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The real thing,50,01-19-12,"We lived in Singapore 35 years ago and Singapore Chilli Crab was an all-time favourite that has now traveled the globe. In recent years the dish has become overshadowed by the salt and pepper crab and other varieties but if you want to try the traditional masterpiece--this is the place to come. Ask for the Sri Lankan crab --about $58 Sing--and a serve of the steamed bread---that's all you'll need with a Tiger Beer--heaven!!!!!! The Dempsey Road location is 5 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road, so you don't have to venture out to the East Coast."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Attentive staff & great food,50,01-12-12,"Caters well to non-seafood eaters, vegetarians , worth a visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Terrible service - No more crab available at 8.30 pm already!!!,10,01-12-12,"I went there for my family to taste their chilli and pepper crabs. When we arrived at 8.30pm on a Saturday night, we were told that the only available crab was teh Alaskan one, which is 400 SG$/kilo!!! What a joke. They told us the Sri Lanka cran would arrive during teh night, so we insisted to stay. After a million back and forth discussions with the staff, we finally were made aware that the crab would be delivered and we could have it. In the mean time, other people had to order the super expensive crab. The quality of the service was very poor. They made many mistakes in the order and the ladies giving away napkins and changing plates could not care less!!! I was very disappointed as I went there many times with an excellent experience. This time it was terrible!! Would not go there anymore"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crab!,50,01-04-12,Best black pepper crab in Singapore. Lovely sitting in the garden. We go back time and time again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper Crab in Singapore,40,01-01-12,"Good location, pretty good prices. They also do the crabs for you if you want."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent seafood in cozy ambience,40,12-15-11,Long Beach @ Dempsey located at quiet place but when you enter inside it is quite crowded. Menu offers excellent seafood Singaporean delicacies. The one we tested was Singaporean crab curry alongwith Tiger beer. You can sit outside or book an independent room for small group. The service is very prompt and friendly. Overall wonderful dining experience in Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love it!,40,11-22-11,"Having been away for more than 8 years, I am glad to see that the food here is still very good. Portions are large and the service staff are wonderful about advising you on how much to order (or in my case, not order). Restaurant is in a good location with indoor and outdoor seating. They do accept reservations, which is necessary, especially on Friday evenings and the weekends. Service is good and it is obvious the servers have been well trained to wait patiently on customers. However when the restaurant gets crowded, then service tends to be spread a bit thin."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Bring a towel!,40,11-20-11,"We just got back from having a great evening. We were two couples dining. My husband had been here before with business associates. We had the drunken prawns, black pepper crab (2) and order of fried rice with prawn, a bottle of wine and 2 beers and it was $122 Singapore dollars per couple. The staff was extremely nice and we learned that the rice or noodle is always brought at the end of the meal. The crab is very messy to eat and we knew this so we brought a hand towel from our hotel for each person. They don't give you napkins like we are used to, but they brought us plenty of wet naps and finger bowls. If you request they will do the ""live"" drunken prawns at your table. There are lots of fish tanks in the restaurant. The flavor of the black pepper crab was delicious. It had a smoked bbq flavor to it. And we all got plenty messy. But, that added to the flavor of the evening!This was a meal not for prissies!! We all had dark ""gunk"" under our fingernails. I would return as it was just a really great dining experience. Fun was had by one and all!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Dining place...,40,11-16-11,"Dempsey is a great dining spot in Singapore and there are quite a number of restaurants here. We came here for a seafood lunch and our choice is Long Beach @ Dempsey.My favourite food here is the Black Pepper Crab, Claypot Rice Noodles with Crab and Lobster with cereal.Its a great dining place, lots of greenery and trees in Dempsey. Feel a world apart from the concrete jungle of Singapore !!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not great,30,11-13-11,"The restaurant was up a hill, not easy to find, even for a local taxicab driver. I had chili crab which was quite tasty but nothing extraordinary to justify the expensive cost. The service was brisk but unfriendly. If you get there by taxi, you might have to ask the restaurant people to call for the taxi and prepare to wait."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great tasting food, but service very questionable!",40,11-12-11,The Crab here is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted on the IslandAmbience is ok - view of Holland road in the backgroundYou have to be careful as they try and sell you too big a portion of crab.. and it is fairly pricey.. but it tastes so good...Service from the waitresses is bizarre - they just dont seem to care too much and couldnt care less that your there really - quite snotty and we dont really care attitude.. but that was my and my friends impressions but it didnt really spoil the food (reminded me of China town in Sydney!)Tables/quality is very average - just a notch up from Hawkerish.. not classyBut despite all this the food was great and that is what we went for.. so I'm giving this place 4/5 and it would get 10/10 on Food!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh but...,30,11-06-11,"The location on Dempsey Hill is a nice one, surrounded by greenery and opposite the Botanical Gardens. The place is huge and usually crowded, so do not expect a quiet dinner time. We had one of the private rooms and privacy is restricted to the visual partition of the rooms. We had 3 noisy groups surrounding us and the noise level was the same as if they had just partied in our room. The food is OK lah, the best dish served being the deep fried snapper with mango chilli sauce. The rest of the dishes was just good but nothing special. One last advise, stay with beer for your dinner, the wine list reads nice, the wine is neither stored properly, nor being served at the right temperature nor does the staff know what wine is."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good food, could easily improve in other areas",30,11-01-11,"We are very glad to have come here, highly recommended by a local. Had the wonderful Chili Crab, with amazing vegetables and crab rice. Delicious!However, the service was so bad, that it nearly ruined our experience. What's up with no napkins???? Everyone gets a wet wipe, and that's it, you are on your own. The problem is that you eat everything with your hands, and all foods are sauce based, so you do the math.I looked over at other tables in the crowded restaurant, and everyone was licking their fingers trying to cope with the absence of the civilized napkin. Weird."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh! Lots of Choices,50,09-27-11,"Really, really enjoyed the food! All was fresh and excellent and we had quite a variety of dishes. Mostly seafood. Drink service was attentive. Food delivered to table as it became ready, a little dis-orienting for people used to typical US service (appetizers then entree). This was the best tasting, best quality food I had while I was in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,BLACK PEPPER CRAB - TO DIE FOR,40,09-06-11,"First time visiting this restuarant and we tried a variety of differnt Chinese dishes which were good, but the black pepper crab was outstanding and highly recommended. Will definately come back again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Drowning in service..,30,09-03-11,"I really do not understand the other reviews complaining on the service, because I was more or less drowning in their very polite service. Almost as much as it stressed me a bit.. I had chilli crab, which was good, but perhaps not as exciting as I had expected. The best part of the meal was the baby cabbage steamed in lots of garlic. I am not convinced that I will go back here, cause I have tasted better food a lot cheaper in this city."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Completely Underwhelming,20,06-22-11,"I was keen to try some Chili Crab in Singapore and was recommended to try here. Wrong choice. The staff weren't that interested in whether I was there or not. Apart from plonking some peanuts and napkin on the table (which was later charged to me) no one took my order for food or drink for 20 minutes, and the crab took another half hour to arrive. I don't know what Chili Crab is supposed to be, but the 'hero' of the dish ie the crab was lost in a mass of chili sauce. Picking your way through the crab to get some tasty morsels was messy ( I needed another 4 napkins to keep cleaning my hands) and the crab's flavour was bland. The chili sauce was too sweet, and not enough heat to even raise some sweat on the brow. I had to go back into town and grab an icecream sandwich to console myself."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Seafood,40,06-05-11,"Probably one of THE places to go in Singapore for Seafood. It has the feeling its been established quite a while, more Raffles than Clarke Quay. Enormous, yes, faded yes, authentic, yes, crowded yes (reserve!), expensive (can be). Crabs are the the speciality and flown in fresh from around the world so not exactly ecologically sound.Ten minutes by taxi from Orchard outside the rush."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,30,04-30-11,"Good food, esp. black pepper crab. However more than once I've booked tables only to find no booking when I arrive. Distracted service."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Black Pepper Crab,40,04-05-11,This was my second visit to Long Beach (last one being in August 2010) and I was not disappointed. I came for the Chili Crab & the Black Pepper Crab and I've decided I like the Black Pepper Crab better. The crabmeat was so sweet and not over powered by the seasoning.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Sea Food Restaurant - Recommend the set menus!,50,10-15-10,"I was in Singapore hosting some customers and was recommended this place as a good place to take them. That was a great recommendation. This place is great!Since we had a group of 10 people I booked a table and ordered a set menu in advance (lucky we did too, as people were queuing to get in). Our menu included Bamboo Clams, Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roasted Chicken, Fish (not sure what type), Tofu, Noodles, Fruit (and perhaps something else) and it worked out at about S$80 a head (including quite a few beers - buy the big tiger draughts). I think that was a bargain. The food was great, especially the black pepper crab. The atmosphere is really nice, and eating there in a group is actually a lot of fun with the rotating table. My one criticism was that service got slower as the night went on. But to be honest we were having a nice time so it wasn't a big problem. I thoroughly recommend this place, and next time I am in Singapore I will check out one of the other branches of Long Beach."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Not THE best chilli crab I've ever had, but still quite good....",30,01-17-10,"Not THE best chilli crab I've ever had, but still quite good...."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No big deal. But nice 'ambience' with the usual tanks in the background,30,12-05-08,No big deal. But nice 'ambience' with the usual tanks in the background
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yes, the white pepper crabs!",40,10-06-08,"Yes, the white pepper crabs!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awful service,10,10-01-08,"Before I start, I am asian and have eaten all over so my standards for what I expect aren't that high! I went to a long beach restaurant, waited 10 minutes to be seated and then 10 mins after ordering was told they were out of crab and I'd have to wait 1 hour before they could get some!I told them I'd wait but to bring out the rest of the dishes I'd ordered, after all I'd come all the way to try the black pepper and chilli crab. Another 10 minutes later, I was told I might have to wait 2 hours so I decided to pack up and leave. The staff were courteous, picked the bill off my table and crossed my orders out.They told me to head to the east coast store, so off I went in a taxi. On arrival, I found that they had called in advance to tell them to charge me for the drinks (all $6 worth!) from the last place!Service was slow, and not courteous for the rest of the meal.Overall, the food is pretty good, the black pepper crab is special but the chilli crab is no better than any other place on the east coast.I would highly recommend NOT ever going to this place."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,their white pepper crabs...,40,06-17-08,their white pepper crabs is fab
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,You MUST try their white...,40,05-24-08,You MUST try their white pepper crab!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Alaskan king crabs go for about $400 each *sigh*,40,05-04-08,Alaskan king crabs go for about $400 each *sigh*
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I go there all the time...,50,04-27-08,"I go there all the time, by myself or in groups. The seafood there is reasonably priced, but expect no frills service, or even very slow service. Also always check the bill, they tend to get it wrong often."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great service.,40,06-14-18,"Not the cheapest place to eat but if you want to feel really special then this is one of the best places to eat at. Staff terrific along with the food. Expect to pay around $180.00 for a few dishes and drinks. Only let down is the price of beer , wine and coffee. Understand about the taxes on alcohol but $10.00 for a coffee does not make sense. Regards David B"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Poor serve food pace,10,06-03-18,"Still hungry after 1.5 hrs due to poor serve pace. Staff unattentive. Teapot too heavy to self serve at full pot, might break fingers. Pretty ex for substandard service. Forget to serve some dishes as well. Serve muslim indonesian maid pork porridge instead of ordered fish porridge."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Flambeed Chicken but advanced order required,40,04-22-18,New Chef Edward Chong has some strong signature dishes which require advanced orders: Tomahawk steak done Xinjiang style (3 days advance order required) and flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine (1 day advance order).Winning dish: flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine is a must try!Other noteworthy dishes:Prawns with passion fruit sauce was succulent with a good bite and refreshing sweet sour passion fruit flavours. Beef short rib with truffle oil & black pepper was excellent with tender Wagyu beef & a fragrant truffle nose. Tofu with lala has a nice “Wok Hei”flavour. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Possibly one of the nicest lohei I’ve had,40,03-09-18,"Invited to a business lunch for CNY and was impressed by the lohei ingredients, abalone/salmon/shrimps all in! The crispy silver bait fish was extremely tasty and refreshing strips of pear inside the lohei really made it my top fav of this cny must-have dish. Generally the food my host picked were all impressive, the braised pork belly, assam fish head.. except for the oxtail stone rice which I personally didn’t really enjoyed. Would probably try their tradition dim sum the next round. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below expectations and disappointment,30,02-27-18,"A lunch visit to Peach Blossom for a celebratory event is an annual affair for me and my family. It was chosen because it had good service and good food, and therefore, we decided to visit it again for the third year this time - thinking that it won't fail us.This year, instead of the ala carte menu, we went for the dim sum ala carte buffet menu. We were led to this table nearest to the exit of the kitchen, which is at the far end of the restaurant. We were still looking at the menu and one of the waiters actually came asking if we would like to have our drinks ordered first. We were flustered as we just settled down but he was insistent that we have our drinks ordered. Thus, having to visit here for several times, I ordered a tea named as ???? without even looking at the menu. It is a tea which I knew the restaurant will have. My brother ordered a ????. To my disappointment, the waiter was unable to recognise that my brother had ordered Oolong tea and was trying to say that there wasn't such tea in the menu until he found it during his panic. And so our drinks were being ordered.As it was our first try at their buffet menu, we did not know which menu should we look at. We queried and the waiter explained to us that we can order anything and also if we were to order dim sum which are not listed in the buffet menu, we will need to pay the outstanding amount. Ok, we understood it. Then came the ordering and missing of multiple orders. The table next to us was a big eater and they ordered more items than us, with similar items ordered and ordered later than us, and theirs were served first but not ours! Oh, not to mention that they were served by the SAME waiter. We later ordered a Cheong Fun from the non-buffet menu and the waiter was trying to tell us that we will need to pay extra in a super ""I cannot comprehend"" intonation plus stuttering. Well, since he mentioned that we will need to pay extra, we said OK! But guess what? It wasn't served at all and we queried him about it. And he said ""I told you that it needed extra money"". Oh.. ok! It's a freaking S$5.80 Cheong Fun and you think we cannot afford it? But anyways, we decided to just end our happening lunch experience as we had enough of begging for our food like a beggar. Also, the food was really not appealing anymore. The Xiaolongbao was not seasoned with loads of Huatiao wine as before, the XO carrot cake looked more like XO fried egg as I ate more eggs than the cake, and the tea was really not flavourful anymore. I think I will really reconsider or not consider my next visit to Peach Blossoms."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food. Nice ambience,40,02-24-18,"Had CNY dinner set menu. Great food, and good service. Had a good view of fireworks during Chingay Parade. Portions are quite good and lobster in lemon sauce was the best dish and praised by all the guests. Even roast chicken was very well done, crispy skin and succulent meat. Steamed fish was also fresh and tender. The special fruit yusheng was very refreshing with a variety of fruits but was a little too sweet with the dressing."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Enjoyable lohei dinner at Peach Blossoms,40,02-15-18,"Visited with extended family members and ordered a substantial feast comprising yusheng, a giant steamed marble goby, roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork with lychees, braised tofu in crab sauce, vegetarian sharksfin and glutinous rice steamed in lotus leaves. Dessert was yuzu cheesecake from the coffee shop on Level 4. Everyone enjoyed the meal. There was so much food we had to take away some of the rice and the dessert. The yusheng was a Marina Mandarin specialty, comprising fruit and salmon - really worth paying a premium for. We used a dining voucher which shaved about $300 off the total bill. Final bill was about $600 - a steal, given the food was of good quality and was for 11 pax."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Chinese it is a yes from us !,40,02-04-18,"It was a Sunday night 8pm and no reservation.Although the restaurant was really full girl at the desk was very helpful and found us a table .Our waitress Mun Fung was very helpful and I enjoyed mandarin Mojito with out the sugar and a glass of Kapuka New Zealand wine by the glass .We ordered the live pan fried prawns in oriental sauce , sensational multigrain fried rice with chilli and seasonal vegetables fungi and garlic .All in all a great fresh Chinese meal with terrific service Yes we would come back "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Truly Cantonese Cuisine,40,01-22-18,Had lunch with some friends yesterday (21 Jan 2018) and had Dim Sum with some other dishes. There were 7 of us and the bill came to around $420. Seems pricey just for a dim sum lunch. However food was good.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Celebrating my Son's birthday ,40,01-19-18,We have been coming back here every year for birthdays and anniversaries celebration. Their high quality of food and services have been consistent.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below average food,20,12-25-17,Neither is the menu creative nor are the standard dishes any great. I may have given the place 4 stars had it been in a hawker center but you have different expectations from a Mandarin Hotel restaurant.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Traditional Cantonese cuisine, and Creative Dim Sum with a modern twist.",40,12-23-17,"Peach Blossoms Located at #05-00 6 Raffles Boulevard, Marina Mandarin, There are abundance of great Cantonese Chinese restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the Peach Blossoms in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant that's found a home at the Marina Mandarin, with tastefully ambience, unique blend of warm and cool tones, and a modern, sophisticated very comfortable place where you can enjoy an authentic fine dining experience. It is a distinctive but good up-market Cantonese fine dining restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. One of the dish that really stand out was the Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel Chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth! .The restaurant also offers a Weekday All-You-Can-Eat Dim Sum lunch buffet .The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality fine dining Fusion Chinese cuisine. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Chinese Fusion,40,12-22-17,A late family dinner at Peach Blossoms was a great experience. A wide range of chinese fusion foods together with a long list of beverages. Excellent customer service. A bit pricy but worth the experience. Crispy squid and wasabi prawns were signature dishes. Dessert too were fantastic. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful place for a group or family meal,50,11-30-17,"Spurred by good reviews on this site, a group of us went to Peach Blossoms for dinner. The location is great with potential views of parts of the Singapore skyline (not the best parts though) and the pretty Marina Mandarin interior hotel lobby. Menu is extensive (and expensive), service excellent, and interior decor attractive (but not romantic). Place was full of groups/families; didn't see couples. Food was very good. Try the avocado/chocolate ice cream dessert to conclude your delicious meal. Strongly recommend reservations."

The serving staff (especially Ms Nobel, Bowie and Vivian) were very friendly and attentive, The manage, Mr Gan, kept popping by to ensure all things ok.

The best Chinese we have visited during our 2 week trips, we were surprised by the generally poor quality of food or the extremely high price for average food, so it was nice to find a restaurant were we enjoyed the meal.Not a budget conscious restaurant, half a dozen dishes cost more than $100 Singapore dollars.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wedding Lunch at Peach Blossoms,50,09-26-17,"We had our wedding solemnisation and lunch held at the Peach Blossoms Restaurant in July. We chose the venue due to the Delicious & unique food, great natural lighting and beautiful interiors which showed up well in our wedding pictures.Vivian was our wedding coordinator and has made the experience a smooth sailing and stress free process. She was very friendly and responsive throughout the wedding planning process and gave lots of helpful suggestions which we very much appreciate. We enjoyed the flexibility of not having to confirm finer details eg menu, guest list till closer to the date which made wedding planning a breeze. For couples who don't want a stressful wedding planning process vs the traditional wedding banquets, I will highly recommend this place. Guests had fantastic comments on the food, we were able to customise our own menu. Feedback on the food tasting was well taken into account on the actual day which we very much appreciated. My favourite dishes were Roast chicken with dried chilli and Steamed grouper with chinese ham. Very yummy and highly recommended! Vivian went out of her way to make sure the day ran smoothly by staying back after operating hours to conduct a wedding rehearsal for us which was her own suggestion. She was very patient throughout the process. Vivian also personally help cut and plate our wedding cake and her plating skills were impressive! We had such a memorable day and will highly recommend Peach Blossoms restaurant! Thanks to the staff of Peach Blossoms who went out the way to make our day so special! We could not have asked for a better experience and venue to hold our wedding."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Peking Duck,10,09-19-17,"We have just dined at Peach Blossom, unfortunately. After reading great reviews we thought we would book. One of my favourite and my husbands absolute favourite dishes is Peking Duck. We ordered 1/2 a duck, this was not carved at the table... not a problem, but what we were brought already wrapped 8 pancakes filled with a small square (8x8mm) of duck skin, just skin, no fat, no meat. We were then bought fried rice with tiny chunks of brown duck meat. Hmm wonder what happened to the breast meat if our duck? We also had the jelly fish and the XO Cod, neither were particularly good. But the Peking Duck, ridiculous :("
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A classy decor with great Chinese Cooking.,40,09-08-17,Stayed at the MM hotel for two nights and tried dining at this Chinese Restaurant. Quite skilful and refine cooking especially on the roast duck and wasabi prawn. The abalone mushroom was great. Service is five star and personnel are courteous and responsive. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Dining Experience,50,09-06-17,Visited the restaurant for lunch. Wasabi prawn is one of my favorite dish. I also enjoyed the dessert with dry ice effect.

The vermicelli was something, as was the fish cooked in their home made sauce. Haven't had any of these dishes before this evening and I'd recommend anyone going there to check it out. To top it off, you won't find an even more attentive service crew, coupled with a Chinese rendition of a birthday poem for my mother in law at the end of our dinner. Thank you Alden, Terry, Sok Teng, Sun Jing and Christine. And thank you marina mandarin!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Quite an exclusive Chinese setting with suiting ambience ,40,08-06-17,Wonderful Chinese fine dining with assurance of freshness and skilful cooking. The starter was great with a good mixture of cold dish. The Peking duck was well prepared. The service staff are friendly and efficient. Just felt sad to notice that the Shark Fin soup are still on the menu of this relatively well known Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Maybe the management could be more conscious of the rampant killing of the sharks. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Service,50,08-02-17,"Hi management,I held a birthday celebration for my mother at Peach Blossoms.I am extremely impressed by the service given by Mr Terry. The pleasant encounter started from my phone call to booking and finally the feast itself.It is rare now to find a staff as polite and professional as Terry. My family and i are very happy with all the arrangements and extra effort put in and coordinated by her.I would not be surprised to see her rising in rank among the staff. Your company is lucky to have Mr Terry.We thank you the time."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),One of my best meal in a Long time ,40,07-12-17,"With my friends who's mum was in the hospitality business. This family goes from from good restaurant to another awesome restaurant. You name it .... this family would have been there. Tonight, it was peach blossom for the first time. Why ? I asked my friends. Both brothers, both so much into good food, wines & whiskeys. They were here to give support to their new manager, Alden Gan. He was with another Szechuan restaurant before joining this joint.This is twice in a month for them visiting the restaurant. We kicked start la la (seashell congee) with black fungus. It was an excellent soupy dish. Next comes, the Yong Tau foo. Wasn't bad as the minced pork on the bean curd had a touch of salty fish which I really like. Fried asparagus was good but the coffee pork ribs were so good. A must ... here.Wagyu beef was next, wasn't bad followed by shiitake & mushrooms, really vegetarian n seriously very tasty too.My friends were loving the Wagyu beef so much that we had another order to what everyone's appetite. Next dish surprised me ... Cantonese cuisine n their special this month was the black flat Hokkien KL style noodles. It was superb. Very very good indeed. I would have finished the plate myself, tasty n reminds me of good Hokkien mee over in the state of Kuala Lumpur.Desserts of jelly & beautiful moon cakes were served. A good night & definitely I will be back with my other friends.Service was awesome. Restaurant manager, Alden Gan just made me a satisfied customer who would drop in again any time soon. 9.5/10 for food.10/10 service.9/10 ambience. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great memories! Thanks!,50,07-02-17,"Had my Solemnization luncheon here on 28 June 2017 and being served professionally by Mr. Alden Gan & his team who has provided my guest and I a very comfortable luncheon experience in Peach Blossoms (Lotus Room). Despite a slight shock to my nephew due to the waiter who accidentally drop a plate from his tray to the floor, and perhaps personally I felt that the soup was slightly salty for me. Nevertheless, the great service with delicious food and its overall ambience compensate it all. Initially we booked at 12 pm, but due to some circumstances we arrived early to the restaurant at 11.15 am in the midst of setting up the room, but Mr. Alden & his team done their best to speed up and set up everything nicely and allowed our guests to enter around 15 minutes later! Amazing! The dishes has been distributed and served individually for the convenience of our guest. We ordered a customized set meal which served 7 dishes with 1 dessert. The black chicken soup starter was delicious! Loved the Peking Duck too, was hoping for more though hahahaha! Great Mango pudding dessert! Thanks Mr. Alden & team!Summary- Food taste: 4.5 / 5- Food presentation on each plate: 4.5 / 5- Ambience: 5 / 5 - Table setup: 5 / 5- View from Lotus Room: 5 / 5 (Thumbs up! Overlooking Shenton Way.)- Room size: 4 / 5 (Slightly cramp for two big tables for 22 pax, but its still great!)- Service: 4 / 5 (Slight delay on the serving of food, in coincidence there was another private lunch too, thus the waitress & waiter have to served both rooms.)- Price: As stated $$$$, but worth it!- Overall: Deserved 5 / 5 and highly recommended for private functions!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice new menu and awesome dinner,40,06-26-17,"Visited Peach Blossom again.Noticed they have changed their menu and ordered some chef recommendation dishes to try.Still loved their peking duck and shark fin soup.Staff is always very accommodating and polite.Strongly recommend peach blossom for lunch, dinner after business and family gathering.Dr E Chow "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Superb Dining Experience at Peach Blossoms,50,06-19-17,"Had the pleasure of celebrating my Dad's Birthday (together with Father's Day) last Friday evening at Peach Blossoms and as usual, the restaurant delivered beyond expectations.Despite the large dinner crowd, service was prompt, impeccable and always delivered with a smile. My parents were effusive in their praise of Mr Alden Gan and his service crew and that set the tone for an excellent evening,Food was exquisite and delicious, justifying its reputation as one of the leading chinese restaurants in Singapore.Thanks for a wonderful evening Peach Blossoms!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mr Ken Yeo,50,06-14-17,Called to reserved a table for 2 at Peach Blossoms for dinner at Sunday 11/6 by a friendly manager Terry Lim. ... food was good and delicious especially the dessert was quite Creative with dry ice splitting smoke .. the staffs service was excellent and thoughtful cos when I order too much food they even remind me of it.

Special thanks for the manager, Terry for writing the beautiful and thoughtful Chinese birthday greeting, and hand made the God of Longevity. Not forgetting Christine and Bowie for the excellent service with a wonderful smile all the time! Thanks for making this birthday celebration a very memorable one! "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch,50,06-06-17,"We have try the buffet a few days ago the food was very nice and the service was excellent ,frienly value for money ."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Chef recommended set meal is awful,20,06-03-17,"Went there on a Friday with my Friend and was recommended the Chef recommended set meal and you can't believe it's from a restaurant of this standard.First after the first two dishes we had to wait more than half an hour for the next dishes while our eight ERS were already served two dishes. Second they served Wagyu beef but the sauce was too sweet and the sweetness overpowered all the taste and you couldn't even tell if it was Wagyu beef, really terrible.Third the entrance was some kind of sweet and sour fish but again it was extremely sweet as if eating sugar.Good for our long waiting the manager offered some roast meat and duck.Advise if you go to this place; don't ever order the set meal as it's really crap.Order the traditional Cantonese à la carte menu, roasted meat, dim sum or fried rice.Tasted the god as if it was hawker food and then when the bill of $217.00 came, really not worth and agreed with my Friend that better we ordered some roast meat, Cantonese soup and some vegetables.Bottom line again don't order any set meal there you'll be completely disappointed."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Really disappointing,20,06-01-17,"It was the start of a six week holiday and we were so looking forward to a great first night extravanganza meal.Regrettably we were so disappointed. The restaurant was only 25% full and that should have alerted me that it is no longer popular.We chose the Set Dinner for $S62. The portions were tiny, lacked imagination and flavour. The duck entree had two tiny slivers of duck, the prawn and and scallop dish had one prawn and one scallop. The main of honey infused lamb loin had two sugar cube size portions of fatty lamb. The fried cod in a BBQ sauce was nice. With a bottle of wine the cost for two was $S290. Maybe the entry level menu did not showcase the gourmet offerings that might be available from the more expensive set menu options, but the food we were presented with sure wouldn't encourage us to want to venture back and pay even more money.The week before we had just enjoyed an entry level set menu experience at China Doll in Sydney for a similiar price and that meal was just fantastic. Every course was delicous."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Outstanding ,50,05-28-17,"I am not huge fan of Chinese cousin.
Harmonious and fresh ingredients,
proper seasoning makes me hungry while I was eating."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Quality Food and Service,50,05-27-17,"Came here to dine with my family on a super busy Saturday afternoon but was still served promptly with much professionalism and food was great. Had a good mix of Dim Sum and dishes from the main menu.The Dim Sum served was really of good quality and price is affordable too. Particularly love the Siew Mai, Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce and Scallop with Filo String. We also had steamed prawns and fish, that was superbly fresh and delicious. Would definitely come back here again for the food and quality service. Great for nice meals with the family in a comfortable ambiance and setting."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dimsum hits n a little miss,40,05-23-17,"Went for Sunday dimsum brunch. Service wasn't fantastic (knowledgeable but no smiles) a little typical of Chinese restaurants but I expected more from 5 star hotel Best: roasted pork and duck n chicken , steamed dumpings. Fish Maw soup to die for (i had 3)Mediocre: pork trotters in vinegar. Excessively sweet n v disappointing Not 4 stars but 3.5"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Ms ,40,05-20-17,Good food and service. But expensive and food portion a little small. Nice ambience for gathering with friends or family.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Expected More,30,05-18-17,"Spent 4 days at the wonderful Marina Mandarin Hotel . We chose Peach Blossom for our last night , anticipating a special evening . We were let down by timing and lack of ambiance. Our order consisted of 2 soups , 1 main , special fried rice & 2 glasses of wine. Our mains appeared on the table as we were eating soup. We were a bit perplexed by the timing of the service. Adding to the disappointment was a large table next to us with 2 toddlers who were allowed to noisily run around their table. Their baby was also crying. We are parents ourselves but wouldn't choose to bring children to such a restaurant after 8.30pm . While this was beyond the control of staff it showed a lack of thought and planning. The restaurant was divided into two sections . Why weren't couples seated elsewhere? Loved the view of Marina Bay sands but our $ 150 could have been better spent elsewhere. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Just one dish ordered but whetted my appetite for more,50,05-17-17,I have tried just one disg here - Garlic Fried Rice. But the taste and quality is excellent. Am surely going to dive further into the menu on my next trip
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),expensive,30,05-16-17,tasty but very small portions and very expensive for what we recieved a pleasent atmosphere and prompt service but worth searching for better value for money
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great food & exceptional services,50,05-14-17,"Managed to find this restaurant from Tripadvisor after reading those favorable comments. Decided to try out with relatives to celebrate birthday & Mother's Day for dinner . It was indeed a good choice. Food was delicious & tasty but what really surprises us was the level of service extended by the staff to make our meal an unforgettable experience. They were exceptionally courteous & friendly plus went that extra mile with trimmings, complimentary birthday desserts & takeaway mother's day & birthday gifts. Special mention goes to the two ladies staff who served us by the name of Christine and Mun Fong plus their other colleagues Alvin, Terry, Bowie, Sook Teng, Hui Hoon, Sun Jing & Akira. I have been to many restaurants that serves good food but this is one of the very few restaurants that the staff really go all out to delight their customers. Will definitely come again. Hope they will maintain the high quality service "

We let off our guards and spoke freely with them as if I had been a regular customer. But this was my first time there and I want to go back again for more occasions. Other staff Alden and Mun Fong smiled to us even though they were serving other tables.Special mention and praises to Terry who wrote well wishes calligraphy on 2 plates for my dad and me. He crafted dough figurines of a pig and shou gong for me and dad respectively. I will show pics of his masterpieces.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration ,50,04-09-17,"Mum’s birthday dinner recently at Peach Blossom, Marina Mandarin was very pleasant one. The food was delicious and staff was very warm and friendly.They helped with the Peking duck so presentable with the side sauce. The rest of the duck meat cooked with dried chilies and cashew nuts – bot crispy and tasty! Other dishes includes vegetables with scallops and tang hoon was refreshing with a unique clean clear taste. The ostrich meat was tender and nice, and the Fried Rice recommended by our waiter was a “WOW” – DELICIOUS!We had dessert – glutinous rice with ice cream and avocado with ice cream served o dry ice flowing. So impressive! Both refreshing and delicious. Then come the longevity buns… it came with a big plate of beautiful wordings and read out cheerfully by their staff Christine. What a sweet gesture! The buns were so delicious that we ordered another 10 to take away!We enjoyed so much that we forgot to take photos of the food. We learnt that the figurines made from flour by one of your staff Terry after his working hours! So creative and Impressive! He said it takes about 7 days to solidify – a charming souvenir indeed!We would like to thank Terry, Jeff, Alden and Christine for making our mother’s birthday dinner so unexpectedly memorable. This place has simple hidden charm.. and we would love to come back may times again!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim-sum quality deteriorated a lot,20,04-07-17,"I have dined in this restaurant 2 years ago and the quality is very good. This time when I went there for dim-sum again, found out their quality deteriorated a lot. All the dim-sum are pre-made and pre-steamed, after we placed order within 5 minutes all the dim-sum is served on our table. By the taste you can tell they have been sitting around in the kitchen for a while. With its price, I expect the quality to be higher with made-to-order dim sum. This restaurant is not very busy, I do not see a need to pre-steamed all dim-sum and serve in a speed of fast food restaurant. Will not recommend it. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),celebrate mum birthday,50,04-05-17,"Last night I and my siblings took my mum to marina mandarin peach blossoms to have dinner and celebrate her birthday.We order poach silver cob fish,coffee spare rib,seafood claypot and other dishes …my mum like all the food and the service is excellent,Christine is very cheerful and friendly,Alden the restaurant manager and Jeff thank you for the warm service.And Terry give my mum a wonderful and unforgettable birthday.a birthday poem written on a plate with the tart cake my brother brought .

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Where guests become friends,40,03-31-17,"The Husband (he has been given an upgrade) and I brought his family there for his father's birthday celebration. Expectedly, the food was flavourful and did not fail us. But what really got our notice was their service (or should I say, relationship) to their diners.Frequent diners, I assumed, were called by their first names. One service staff even remembered a diner's birthday had just passed.That weekend saw many diners celebrating their loved ones' birthdays. We heard a birthday rap done by a service staff and wondered if it was only for that table.Nope! We got a birthday specialty too - a birthday poem penned by the manager, with a figurine to boot. Apparently, Peach Blossom's assistant manager goes the extra mile by making these flour figurines for diners on his day off from work.Overall, it was an engaging and lovely dinner. Thank you Terry, Nobel, Bowei, Sook Teng, Akira, Mun Fang and of course, Christine for the warm service. See you again on 9/4/17 (i am so sold on their service that im bringing my family there soon).This is so not a paid advertisement!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exemplary Service from Restaurant Manager,50,03-17-17,"Booked the place for dim sum lunch under the Meritus card voucher - giving me 30% discount for food, a bottle of wine and a cake. To my dismay, I was informed the voucher cannot be used for the buffet dim sum. My pre-selected white wine, Sauvignon blanc, was also not available at the restaurant as they only serve Chardonnay. Both were not told to me when I booked the restaurant via the card concierge. Fortunately, Mr Alden Goh (Restaurant Manager), noticed our unhappiness and turned the situation around. He explained the terms of the voucher and although the restaurant does not carry Sauvignon blanc, he made arrangements for us to have it (instead of the Chardonnay). He also made sure that we are well-attended to throughout the lunch. Although, we still could not take up the buffet dim sum - took ala carte, the food was of good quality and the entire dining experience went really well. I must say that the service we received is exceptional, thanks to the exemplary service from Alden. Thank you!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Memorable Dinner at Peach Blossoms,50,03-14-17,"Wanted to bring my parents and elderly relatives for a good Chinese dinner and Peach Blossoms was undoubtedly my #1 choice. As usual, we left delighted after yet another highly satisfying meal that had everyone beaming from ear to ear.The ongoing Peking duck promotion was excellent value for money, especially when you take into account how succulent the duck was compared to many of its competitor's offerings. The other dishes were equally scrumptious and divine as well and spoke volumes about the restaurant's pride in their craft. The quality that distiguishes Peach Blossoms from the rest must be the superb service of its staff led by restaurant manager Alden. Alden's warm and personable style ensured that everyone had a comfortable evening of laughter paired with the thoughtful food recommendations he made.Thanks to his trusted suggestions, our entire dining party (both young and old) got to enjoy a delectable mix of dishes that catered to all our tastebuds.Another memorable evening! Thank you Alden and Peach Blossoms!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Fabulous dinner!!!!!!!,50,03-14-17,"Yesterday, my family and I had the pleasure to dine at Peach Blossoms for dinner with my grandparents. Although it was very crowded, the staff were extremely friendly and the service was fast. The dishes were succulent and main courses tantalizing. Coupled with the high quality desserts we ordered(fried durian), it is fair to say that we had the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good lunch with Friend ,50,03-10-17,We having a buffet lunch at peach blossom a few day back the food was very delicious and the staffs was friendly and helpful will bring more Friends to try the buffet lunch
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Lots of selection, but service fell short",30,03-10-17,"Plenty to choose from, what we did have was very nice. Service was very slow with staff opting to serve Asian customers and friends / family of the kitchen staff first. We ordered 12 spring rolls, a vegetable dish & 2 mains, we questioned if that would be enough for two and advised would be more than enough. We aren't big eaters and found we were still hungry when we left. Dishes were a lot smaller and more expensive than all the other restaurants we ate at this week. Had to ask twice for the bill which was strange as they didn't look busy with only 1/3 of tables occupied. Bit of a shame as had read good reviews about this place, the hotel was first class on the other hand. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Decent food but not outstanding and the service was grumpy,30,03-09-17,We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant when we went for dinner which was a good sign. It was far from crowded but we were greeted at the door as if we should have made reservations. The food was very good but not as good as I had hoped. I had the idea it was a family restaurant as there were many children.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Instant service from ALL available staff,50,03-07-17,"First reputable restaurant where we got service from practically every staff who passes by. And it was from the manager to staff servicing other diners. The service started with the staff who settled us down and continuously came around to top up our tea cups and change our side plates to the manager who was passing by when we asked him to add some Tim Sum to our meal. Which he did immediately by writing them down and punching the order into the computer. We would have loved to order the a la carte Tim Sum buffet but it would had busted up too many diets. Just go and try it out. Better still stay in the hotel like we did many years ago, go back to the suite to drop everything after some shopping and wash up a little before going for a meal at the restaurant. Don't sign the bill to your hotel account as they always have credit card promotions on a la carte meals."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent Service,50,02-28-17,"Staff service at the restaurant is great. Very attentive and friendly. Special mention to staff Ms Vivian, Mun Fung, Faam Lee Lee and Alden. Always make my dining experience a joy there. Thanks , guys!"

The dishes were delicious with very nice presentation. The services were simply impeccable.

Service was not attentive--each of us took turns pouring tea. At end of meal, waiters moved in a table to set it up? Very uncouyh."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing experienece,20,01-02-17,"Food:Roasted pork - the ratio of lean meat, fat, skin is totally wrong. Apparently over-cooked and very hard to chew.Roasted duck - way too dry, way too tough!Shrimp vermicelli roll - there is only 1 shrimp in each roll, which is very absurd. If you are running low on shrimps, then put it as out-of-stock.The only dishes that are okay are shrimp dumpling (har gaw) and egg custard bun.Service:Upon arriving, they couldn't find our reservation (we called like 3 hours ahead to make reservation yet they lost track). And the lady at front desk just pointed at a chair saying ""you sit over there first"" without any apology or politeness. We waited for 15min and no one came to us with any information, hence we had to ask again.The girl named Emma took our order and she is the only one that we find friendly and responsible. After confirming our order, she left the menu with us so we could add on if needed. 2min later, another lady came over (named something like soon teng) and grabbed the menu away. Then she asked whether we've ordered, so we told her that we want to keep the menu. She said okay and placed the menu randomly on another side of the table, blocking the position for serving dishes. The basic courtesy we expect is that she at least places it where she took it, but no."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),How to dine like an Emperor / Empress,50,11-15-16,"This restaurant has it all for Brunch; Decor, Service, and the FoodIf you wish to impress a first time visitor to Singapore, and transport them to what must have been like dining in the Imperial court of China. The decor has been tastefully designed to provide a hint of the Chinese court yard, without feeling like you're in Disneyland. The service is so discreet ,polite, and helpful in making suggestions. But it the food that takes center stage here. Its creative, visually stunning and most of all, delicious. Do not come if you are on a diet; you will only torture yourself. It is impossible to resist asking for seconds and third servings."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Service and Food,40,11-14-16,"Selected this Restruant to celebrate a special occasion and was not disappointed.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Memorable experience ,50,11-13-16,"Came to celebrate my dad birthday. Was served by the friendly team; terry , Nobel , Jeff and Christine. Had a memorable experience w special thanks to Terry for his calligraphy plate presentation. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice but not Wow,40,11-13-16,"One of the good Cantonese restaurants in Singapore with ‘prestige’ ambience and professional service. It has never scored below 7.5 in my personal scale of 1 to 10 but also never above 9. This meal proved no different.Unlike the last time, I was a guest and therefore did not choose the meal. I probably would not have chosen what my host chose given that there were only three of us. To start, she chose ginseng oolong tea. Crisp with only a slight after taste of the ginseng. The only problem is that it does not go well with all dishes and clashed with two dishes in particular. Stock to the Imperial Pu Er or have it at the end of the meal.We started with mushrooms in white truffle oil. I do not like truffle oil at the best of times (though I would make an exception for the lobster and glass noodles at the Imperial, Asia Square) and the oil did little to highlight the subtle ‘fifth’ flavor of the mushrooms. The crispy roast pork was very good. Dry to the touch, moist underneath with no fatty after taste. The jasmine tea smoked chicken clashed badly with our tea but the other two did not seem to mind. Maybe I am too fussy. Because of my decision to no longer eat things that are or could be endangered, she gave the shark fin and birds nest a miss. Instead we had the restaurants’ version of Monk Jumps over the Wall. It is notoriously difficult to get right but at this meal it was the standout dish. The steam fish, whilst good, was too much after the sensory and stomach overloading soup. The braised rice vermicelli with fish and bitter gourd again clashed with the tea. However, the coconut pudding with its three layers and unconventional pairings of different parts of the coconut left me again revising the meal upwards again. 8 out of 10 methinks."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointed - average at best,30,11-12-16,"We booked this restaurant for tonight 12th November when we were in England based on the great reviews on here that also determined that we would stay at the hotel.We booked for 930 as we were arriving from Jakarta. Arriving at the restaurant we were kept waiting while they found a table. I'm guessing there must have been a worse one., but we were tucked in the corner next to the servers station - dirty plates and other dishes a glorious sight!!The food was okay but we were rushed - perhaps the proximity of 1030 and the closing time of the restaurant was to blame.The servers were not attentive and the ambience of which others have spoken was non existent. We could barely make ourselves heard over the clattering of plates and dishes as they tidied and prepared the tables for the next day.There was nothing special about the meal - equally as good food can found in other restaurants.A huge disappointment"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good service,50,11-12-16,"Good service there and would definitely recommend it to my friend. Staffs there were very friendly and nice,I would definitely like to go there again:) "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Excellet ambience, food and service",50,11-11-16,"We really love the ambience of the place and a few dishes that I would really recommend is the roasted pork, wasabi prawns and wagyu beef cubes with longan. The dishes were really tasty. Also it was my mum's actual birthday and manager Terry actually offered to provide her with ??, what surprised us was how intricately the birthday dish was displayed with handmade flour decorative items and written with really meaningful chinese words. Thanks Christine for being so enthusiastic with us in taking the photos as well! We really had a wonderful dinner last night :)"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),B.d lunch.,50,11-07-16,"Made a reservation through Terry. Was there for my b.d lunch with family. We got ourself a nice seating next to the wine rack. The ambience was nice and comfy not too loud and was quite relaxing to be able to hear the birds chirping outside. The staffs were extremely helpful and observant to details. The foods tasted delicious and were well presented, my recommendation goes to the soya sauce chicken. Lastly, Terry prepared a nice gift together with the cake on a plate where he penned down his well wishes in mandarin. This is my 2nd time having my b.d celebrated over a meal with family there, peach blossom never fails to impress. Thank you. "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fantastic dim sum, great service",40,10-30-16,"I decided to bring my family to the dim sum buffet in Peach Blossoms, since it has been a number of years I last patronised the restaurant. The decor remains the same, and the service remains great. The dim sum buffet was quite different from the one three or four years ago. For one, they have a trolley that carries several popular dim sum dishes from which you can choose from. Secondly, they offer a select range of choice appetizers you can choose from (one choice per diner). So you get to try abalone, lobster, sharks' fin dishes in the buffet.Choices are abundant in this a la carte buffet. You can choose main courses, porridge, noodles, rice, djm sum, soup and even desserts. Since it's a buffet, you can order dishes any number of times. Portions are not small, nor are they huge. The food is also not too oiley. I didn't get the bloated feel after the meal.The buffet is available between 11:30 and 3 pm. It's a good deal, for a person at $58++. Children below 6 years old are free. Great to try if you will like to!"

Terry was wonderful and obliged with a private room at the back of the main restaurant. The private room had a really nice ambience and had views of the skyline of the financial centre and Marina Bay Sands. He also helped plan the menu, taking into account my father's special dietary requirements. The service was impeccable and he and Christine devoted themselves to our room, introducing each dish and course as it came and them serving individually, while at the same time ensuring that our drinks were always filled.The food was excellent. The soup was a clear double boiled consommé with free range chicken and was really flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the garlic roasted chicken and the korobuta pork chop was spectacular, with every delicious morsel melting in the mouth.After dessert there was a birthday cake placed on a large plate on which was inscribed a Chinese poem written personally by Terry, who also incidentally personally arranged the flowers on the plate. All in all it was a memorable dinner which my father hugely enjoyed. Many thanks to Terry and Christine and we will certainly return!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Excellent food quality, bad service, terrible handling of glassware and average value ",30,09-18-16,"Had dinner in this restaurant before leaving Singapore the next day. It 's conviniently located in Marina Manderin Hotel but hard to assess because of the formula one race. The food was lovely, and the chef cooked excellent quality food that we all enjoyed. However, the service was on average only. A waitress accidentally breaked a teacup in our table while serving food, which reflected on the terrible handling of glassware and ruined the overall service and ambience of the restaurant. Otherwise, the service will have been nice. The price was expensive but Reasonable because of the high quality food served. "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good quality food, good quality service.",40,09-10-16,"Have celebrated a few wedding anniversaries including our own and a few birthdays in Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin Hotel Singapore. Variety and quality of food is good. I have personally known one of the service team leaders, Terry Lim for many years and he has always been very attentive to his customers, knowing their likes and dislikes. We just had a dinner with another couple friends in Peach Blossoms a few days back to celebrate the birthday (of the wife) and their wedding anniversary. Though Terry was away selling mooncakes but his colleagues, Nobel, Christine and Alicia served us with equal attentiveness, and arranged a pleasant surprise for our friends. They had an enjoyable dining experience that evening.Thank you Nobel, Christine, Alicia and Terry. Keep up the good work! It takes a big heart and humility for one to be able to work in the F&B industry with passion despite the long hours and numerous challenges with difficult customers from time to time. I see these in you! :)"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome Birthday Dinner - Delicious Food & Top class service by Christine,50,09-04-16,"Came here for my birthday dinner with my family. Probably one of the best service I have ever received in S'pore. Very personalized by the service staff, Christine, who was so bubbly and cheerful throughout the entire night. Also big thanks to the other staff members, Terry, Bowie and Nobel who i understood played a huge supporting role in the preparation of the dishes. Most importantly, the food was amazing, and i think the highlight for me had to be the wasabi prawns, ying yang hor fun and the beef cubes.

Highly recommended if you seek an enjoyable evening with good food and service that will not disappoint."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointing.,20,08-28-16,"Excellent service but very bland food and overpriced. The spring rolls tasted as if they were bought frozen from a supermarket. The Soy chicken was a very small serving and tasted like it was simply poached in water with no sauce, flavour or seasoning to speak of. The pork collar in xo sauce had no punch at all. We also requested tap water but was presented with 3 bottles of water over the course of the meal valued @ $10 each which was only realised when paying the bill. Very disappointing overall. "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Super poor service, bad atmosphere. Does not deserve to be anywhere near the rank it is",10,07-30-16,"Was looking forward for a nice birthday dinner. Made reservations specifying this is for a couple birthday dinner. Came to restaurant, they had no reservation but got a table as restaurant was empty. We got put in a bad spot with worn furniture from the last decade with no atmosphere whatsoever and floodlight lighting. Servers were extremely non-attentive and after waiting and finally checking what's going on they were all chatting in a corner. Food came out of the kitchen spread over 15 minutes. It was hard to just have a regular meal. Either just rice or just meat or just vegetables, nothing together. BAD. Just choose one of the many restaurants in the city."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good quality food and good service,40,07-28-16,"We had a small family dinner for my sister's birthday at Peach Blossom. It's a small cosy restaurant which serves generally good Chinese food esp yifu noodles and salted egg prawns. The waiters/waitresses were pretty attentive. The only issue was that the food came rather slowly when the restaurant was full.The staff who attended us wes very good, especially Nobel and Christine who even sang the birthday well wishes for my sister."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mother's Day Dinner,40,05-12-16,"We ordered from the ala carte menu and we felt that it was more valued for money than the set menu. We had cod fish for many of the dishes and I must say, the food was fresh and definitely tasty. The only pity thing is that the portion is too small, even the large portion was too small for a table of 11 + 1 child. Food was also served very slowly. Although it allowed us to have ample time to sample the dishes, the serving pace could be faster. Would not mind going back for another meal to try out some dishes which I did not have a chance to order."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exemplary Service,40,04-24-16,"A family dinner to celebrate a birthday, and the food was exceptional + service was commendable. The highlight of the dinner was the longevity bun platter with its exquisite dough(?) God Of Longevity, and a well crafted Chinese Poem for the birthday girl. Kudos to the restaurant manager (Aidan?) and his team for a wonderful dinner."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Kitchen's Standard Marred Front-line Service,20,03-12-16,"My mum & I just had the dim-sum buffet lunch at Peach Blossoms.The front-line service was praiseworthy. Reservation was smooth. Reception was warm. The waitress (Alicia) was attentive & thoughtful. It is thus regrettable the kitchen's standard detracted the service quality from the front-line team.Right from the start, the speed of food readiness was not exactly expeditious. Especially for a non-crowded restaurant. It was tolerable ... until the last order of main dish was made. It was a simple order of just 1 small portion of noodles. After 10 minutes, Alicia took the initiative to hasten the food. After 20 minutes, I asked for the bill. After the bill was signed, then the 1 portion of ordinary noodles finally appeared. By then, it was more than 23 minutes since the order was made.Perhaps the kitchen team mistook the concept of dim-sum buffet to be that of Slow Food Movement. The original intention was to assess if the place's a potential venue for a birthday celebration at month-end. The kitchen team has made the decision for us."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food if you don't mind the unhappy lady taking your orders.,40,02-19-16,Food is good though portions are extremely small. Especially of good value is their set dinner. The waitresses are extremely cheerful and friendly. Same could not be said about the lady are taking our orders. She are grumpy and unhappy and seems intent to let it be known to us.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Satisfied!,40,01-21-16,"About a week ago when we were visiting from Sydney, we were brought by a dear friend to this restaurant for dinner. I must say the service of the staff and especially the manager, Terry made our visit all the more memorable. Knowing that we were invited guest from overseas, he paid special attention and was particularly helpful in recommending the dishes of that night. To cap off a wonderful dinner, the dessert was served on a plate calligraphed with a chinese poem honoring our visit and there were two figurines of the 'monkey and goldfish' carved out of dough which were crafted by him personally. On the whole, this is a good fine dining restaurant where the service and the food are worth paying for. ."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Having lunch with friends ,50,01-18-16,The dim sum buffet was very nice and the pricing is very affordable for a 5-star hotel. More than 70 varieties of items to select. The staffs are friendly. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dinner,50,01-16-16,Had dinner here with a friend. Very nice food and very good service. The staff are very friendly and product knowledge is excellent. Will definitely recommend friends and family to this place.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim sum buffet ,50,01-13-16,"I saw the recommendation for the Dim sum buffet through this website and have tried it.I came with my friends to celebrate a birthday bash. We were served with a plate of birthday wishes in the form of chinese poem. The food quality is good and value for money.Their sevice staff is very friendly and attentive to us. The birthday wishes are also well written. I understand the poem was by their service staff, Terry. This venue is worth a second visit."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent service justifies the price premium,50,01-10-16,We had lunch buffet and weren't particularly impressed by the menu initially. But we were pleasantly surprised by the food quality! It was a full house yet the service was immaculate. Service manager Mr Terry deserved special mention for his prompt and detailed attention to our needs despite a relatively overwhelming crowd turnout that afternoon. He remembered every fine detail that my friends would request of him. It was definitely money well spent at Peach Blossoms. Looking forward to their new menu! 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Maybe it was a bad day... but bad bad bad,10,01-10-16,"I saw this restaurant on a list of the top 10 Dim Sum restaurants, and was excited to try... in short very disappointing. It could have been a really bad day for the restaurant, and maybe a one off, but I felt that the review needed to go forward in the hope that there is some way the management can learn from it.We were the first in the restaurant on this Sunday morning, and we quickly settled in to ordering from the a la carte buffet. The most basic items they had on hand on the tray they brought to our table, but when we ordered off the menu, this is where all the problems began. We actually waited 90 minutes for our orders to come out, and with three small kids, this was not an ideal situation. At this point, other tables which came to the restaurant almost an hour after our arrival, started receiving food that we had ordered, and yet... still nothing for us.At this point I asked one of the staff where our orders had gone, and the staff just said they would check on it. Still no answer or anyone came back, so I called for the manager. Finally when the manager made time for us, he told us that the computer system had got jammed up and the orders weren't coming through. It would appear that they didn't think telling anyone they screwed up was in order. Shame they couldn't use something more advanced, like a piece of paper and a pen.So... finally after multiple complaints, the food started to arrive. One order which was mean to be Lobster in a Cheese Sauce, turned out to be lobster in a basic canned nacho cheese, this felt like it completely ruined that lobster. Then when we got the beef, it was way undercooked, and all gristle.Finally the biggest insult was that we had a friend who avoided pork due to her faith, and because if this I ordered roast duck, and then for my kids roast pork, which I made as two separate orders. They then decided that because they were way over time, they put the two items together on the same plate. When they brought it our, I explained that there was a reason why I separated the two orders. The waiter's suggestion was then to put the existing dish on two separate plates... I almost fell off my chair.I really wanted to love this place, I was excited, and my wife can tell you how much I wanted to come... but really.... very very very bad experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mega yu sheng invited by peach blossoms,50,01-08-16,"lou hei yu sheng invited by peach blossoms marina mandarin are very surprise which i never seen before in my life for the monkey head mega yu sheng, the food for tonight are very delicious, th service are also very bravo espeacially Terry, Nobel, Bowie and Ryan, they serve us very nice are care."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent place for dinning,50,01-08-16,We were there 2 days ago. Good food. Delightful ambiance. Very high standard of service displayed by staff. Managers Alden and Terry were there to make sure that everything was running smoothly. We were very impressed and enjoyed our meal there.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great Service, though can be expensive",40,01-08-16,"Dined here with a few friends and the service is very warm and hospitable. They allowed me to use my Mandarin Lifestyle voucher which granted me 35% off and a free bottle of wine, plus a 500g cake. However, the cake needed 3 days advance notice (which the voucher didn't mention) and I will have to collect swing by again to collect the cake in future. On first glance, the menu is quite expensive and their premium selection of teas also feels a bit too expensive, but the great friendly service really makes up for it. the staff were very attentive and were prompt in changing new plates, topping up our tea and water and were helpful in suggesting dishes and recommendations. The trio of meats were really nice (char siew, soya chicken and roast duck) and we also ordered half a peking duck which they used the meat for a fried mee sua. The crispy roast pork was also very well done and paired with the mustard sauce, was very delicious. For the negatives, in one of our dishes, home made tofu with seafood, one scallop was completely off and the waitress gladly gave us a replacement dish of prawn with wasabi mayo. That was good customer service and generous of them. In this day and age, I also expected sharks' fin to no longer be on any menu, but they still had it on as a premium item. I hope they will end this unethical dish and stop serving it in the near future. Overall, after using our voucher, dinner came up to be $35 per person and we were really full and happy with the food and service. Hence, without the voucher it would have been $50 per person and that's still a very reasonable price for fine dining chinese restaurant. We'll definitely come back!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Still Good,40,01-05-16,"Whenever we have a meal at Peach Blossoms, whether just 2 persons or a dinner event, the staff, Nobel, Bowie, Vivian, Jeff, Terry, Sook Teng are always patient with our requirements and changes, trying to accommodate our requests. They really put in a effort to ensure all is smooth during the dinner event.The food standard is still good, receiving good comments from friends with whom we had dinner with. Our son had soup and he said that it tasted like home cooked."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good won tons,30,12-31-15,"This is average when compared to a Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. You might find the comparison unreasonable since this is Singapore but there are many good dim sum venues in Singapore. We had prawn rice rolls and also pork rice rolls which were good but came in a strange soy that I've never had before and I've eaten a lot of rice rolls - trust me. The won ton noodle soup is good however for a won ton. We also had dumplings in spicy sauce which tasted average at best. The service is good, however when we were there the place was practically empty so it was to be expected. The restaurant itself is fairly standard looking so not sure it would be ideal for celebrations but it is fine for dim sum if you are in that area. Would I go again?? Probably not.. Would I recommend.. Yes if in the area and had to eat dim sum or was staying in the hotel and didn't fancy taking a walk outside."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Holiday Dinner with Family,50,12-29-15,"Nice restaurant with good service and outstanding food. We booked a table for twelve and were pleased with the ambience, recommended dinner items from the waiter and relative value. We all shared thanks to the lazy susan a terrific dinner: - Cream of corn and crab soup x 4 - Pumpkin soup in a nice squash bowl x 2 - Hot and sour soup x 2 (spicy and flavorful) - Red grouper steamed in light soy sauce x 2 - Seafood fried rice - Fried noodles with seafood - Vegetables with garlic, ginger and scallops - Whole crispy roast chicken - Wagyu beef cubes with vegetables (and lychees ... a bit surprising there but good) - Shrimp with wasabi sauce (delicious)Again, everything tasted great and was presented well."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A smashing way to celebrate my 50 th birthday!,50,12-29-15,"Had this place booked for a while for Christmas Day dinner which was part of a big birthday trip to Singapore ,warmly welcomed and greeted by name at the door without even disclosing who we were! The resturant interior is beautiful , calm with very efficient service. We opted for some safe Cantonese food with the stand out dishes being the Peking duck and Kurobuta pork which were divine. The bill was reasonable for the quality and presentation of dishes and my friends at work even sent me over a bottle of bubbly from the UK which the staff set up , a nice surprise and it made the day even more special . If you are around the Marina Bay Area well worth a visit ,The set meals also look interesting and varied."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Pleasant and memorable dining,40,10-28-15,"This evening I had dinner with my family at Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin. The Manager, Mr Terry Lim, was friendly and enthusiastic. He recommended us dishes that were delicious and balanced after finding out our likes and dislikes. The service staff were equally pleasant and attentive especially Ms Nobel. All these made our dining experience tonight a pleasant and memorable one!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good food, very expensive!!",30,10-26-15,"eat there some time ago... good food, small portion, freaking expensive! Recommended dish... Shark cartridge soup, roast duck and roast meat, can't remember the rest. everything is ok , NOT the price!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Not a place for dim sum,20,09-14-15,Ala carte dish was good. However the dim sum was a great disappointment. Har kow and siew mai taste like those from supermarket straight to the table.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exquisite Ala Carte Dim Sum Buffet!,40,08-26-15,"For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/08/ala-carte-dim-sum-buffet-at-peach.htmlThe service here was not so good. No one attended to us to take our drinks order after we were seated for around 5-10 mins - We have to call for them. There were quite a few times we couldn't find any staff nearby us to place our food order whereby the restaurant was only half-filled. As this restaurant has 3 sections, they should assign 1 or 2 staff at each section to standby since this is a 5 star hotel. Most of the staff were not with any smile too except one of them was good.I would like to highly recommend their Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth!Overall their food quality was quite good, slightly higher than other 5 star hotel chinese restaurants that I've visited, except some of the dim sum and their dessert really needs much improvements! If only the service can be warm and better, this place will be perfect. I felt that with this price of SGD58++ per person for only 2 hours buffet during weekend is quite rush. Most people would rather go for Jade@Fullerton at only $38++ with free flow tea for about the same dining hours."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Beijing Duck was superb,40,08-20-15,"We ate there on our first evening in Singapore and were not dissapointed.
We were well explained and advised, and the food was good.
Expensive, especially the drinks, as everythere in that area."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Always a Good Experience,10,07-23-15,Dining at Peach Blossom has always been an enjoyable experience. We are regulars at Peach Blossom and has been for past 5 years. The standard of food has always been consistent. Even when we host dinners with more than 30 people. The dim sum dishes are also very good. Service and ambiance is good. Good for business entertainment too as they have private rooms.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great variety of food and service,50,07-16-15,Service was prompt and the staff was very attentive. Great tasting food coupled with nice ambience. An overall great and satisfying experience. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Only Regular Customer should come?,10,07-12-15,"My family was at the restaurant this afternoon. Surprisingly this restaurant was only treated their regular guests with the warm hospitality. As we are the first timer we did not receive what a normal customer should receive. No staff take our order or served drink after sat down for more than 10 minutes, no change of plate, order was forgotten etc..."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),High quality dim-sum,40,07-10-15,"Came here for yumcha and dim-sum on a Sunday. The food here is at high quality, for us coming from HK also felt the dim-sum here is of very good standard.You have stunning view of MBS while enjoy your meal. Price is expensive and portion is small, as expected in a top 5 class hotel. Size of dim-sum is tiny. Recommend for business lunch or a good treat for family."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious beef and shrimps,50,05-26-15,"We ordered their specialties- beef wagyou and prawns with wasabi and mayo. The beef was tender and cooked just right. It had lychees which was unusual and heightened the meat's flavor. The prawns were big, topped with roe and were equally delicious. Fried rice with fish roe completed our meal. Even the jasmine tea that was served was good quality.Since we are staying at Marina Mandarin and it was raining, dining here was convenient. The setting is similar to most high end Chinese restaurants. We did not get to enjoy the view as mentioned in other reviews. Our table was far away from the window. Nevertheless, it was a very good meal."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch at peach blossoms,50,05-16-15,"This is an excellent place to eat lovely ambience, great food and exceptional service staff must mention Nobel who is gem among service staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all of the people I know. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious wasabi prawn & soft shell crab,40,04-25-15,"Ate dinner here with my team. We ordered a couple of dishes which included this fried soft shell crab and wasabi prawn which was really really good. The ambiance was typical fine dining Chinese resto, service was ok, but what won me over were those two dishes. Would come back to order them if ever I am in the area. The place is good for both family and business gatherings."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Food and Excellent Service,50,03-25-15,"Came to dine with my family and ordered a few dishes and it was excellent! The Multigrain Rice and 3 Eggs Spinach are my recommendations, loved the textures and flavour of the rice.Service is great and the ambience is really relaxing with the wooden decor. Would recommend others to come and will definitely be back soon!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Cantonese food,40,02-26-15,Food is good but service is spotty during Chinese New Year period. We have no issues with the food nor the pace of food being served but the staff are simply too overwhelmed to be able to remember other requests.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Value for Money?,30,11-02-14,"The setup and ambiance is very good. Very Chinese decorations with hostesses in cheongsam. There are many round tables which could sit up to 12-14 pax. We could see that the restaurant has tried to come up with new and special dishes to stand out among the other restaurants. But unfortunately, my family and I agreed that after eating there for 3 times in the last year, the ""unique"" dishes are not as good as the classic dishes. For example, their ""normal"" siew mai is better than their specialty quail egg siew mai. Overall, though the food is average, i felt that the price was slightly high considering the quality of food. But I must say that the setting of the restaurant was very cosy."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),So much that is excellent let down by little things,40,09-27-14,"This is now our 10th meal at Peach Blossoms, at least, since we often stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel when in Singapore. We love the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the ease of access when staying at the hotel. Everything is excellent except they let themselves down with easily fixed logistic errors.First they serve all the dishes so quickly without warming stands that you feel under pressure to eat quickly so that the dishes are still warm when consumed. All they need to do is have warming stands or to be prepared to serve dishes in a sequential order.Second, we ordered a bottle of wine and each time our glasses were empty we had to ask the waitress to serve more wine - either be more attentive, have a dedicated sommelier or place the wine bucket beside the table so you can self-serve.Prices are confident but not over the top considering the quality of the food. All in all a good dining experience that could so easily be a great dining experience if they paid more attention to the details described above.David C"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),the worst Chinese meal we have ever had!,20,09-20-14,"our first night at the hotel and to celebrate we thought we would have a good Chinese meal at Peach Blossom. The broccoli was over cooked, the spring rolls were soggy, the rice tasted like it had been cooked in old oil, the prawns in egg tasted like they had been rolled in sand first but the worst thing was that although we had left more than 80% of our meal not once were we asked if everything was ok!! very disappointing...."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Probably the worst chinese meal I've ever eaten,20,08-30-14,"There on business we decided on the meal for 2. Expecting a real feast we ended up still hungry at the end and for 200 Singapore dollars including a little wine monstrously expensive. Two soup courses, no rice, grumpy staff no return."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good Cantonese restaurant in a cozy atmosphere,40,07-09-14,"The restaurant is actually pretty small but it creates a cozy atmosphere and you ask for a table by a window, you'll get to enjoy a very nice view of the Singapore skyline. Overall, the food was really good and the service excellent. I highly recommend the wasabi prawns. The only trouble is actually how to find the entrance to the Marina Mandarin hotel from Marina Square Shopping Center!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Restaurant for good food, atmosphere and reasonable price",50,06-19-14,"The look of the restaurant from outside is quite interesting including inside when you walk in. The seat is comfortable with varieties of foods to choose. I am during the abalone promotion with abalone set menu. I enjoy the taste of the food here. Furthermore, staffs are very friendly and help you with all the description of the food. I might suggest the soya chicken, abalone and soup.the price is quite reasonable compared with the food we ordered. This restaurant is quite highly recommended to visit."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),nice even for sets,40,06-14-14,"I had the set lunch there, had low expectations as it was not ala carte but pretty decent , nice sweet and sour pork. Roast duck and chicken combination was great too. However, didn't rate it a five as it is rather standard fare though well prepared, no special differentiating factor that caught my attention. Service was efficient and the decor was great, worthy of photographs; nice view of the harbour and not too cramped like the restaurants in the malls, space is a commodity in singapore. Would recommend if you are avoiding the common noisy chinese restaurant."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent,50,03-22-14,"Went there alone but the staff was very helpful in making the selection. They even adapted for my taste the Wagyu beef by replacing the longan with asparagus. The seafood rice was outstanding too. Yes, it is an expensive place but that is kind of expected."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent Situation Management,50,03-03-14,"Not quite a crisis, but it was an unexpected situation that excellently managed by the restaurant staffs and making things amicable for the diners.I was having my birthday dinner at the restaurant on 2/Mar, just as we have started the dinner, suddenly some lights went off and next to minimum light source, by then the restaurant staff informed us there was a fire on the same floor and restaurant kitchen need to cease operation right away, so our dinner have to be discontinued. The staffs quickly offered us to dine at alternate restaurant on the next floor, so that the celebration will not be affected.when we got to the next floor restaurant, everything have set up for us nicely, complimentary wines were provided as a gesture for the inconvenience caused. best of all, we also need not pay for the meals....a wonderful way of customer relationship management.Like to place on record for this commendable action by the restaurant staffs."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing,20,01-19-14,"A very nice setting but sadly the food was bland and uninspiring. The peeking duck was delivered to the table in very small pancakes, we would have preferred to have done our own. The pancakes were tiny and very thin. The skin was not at all crispy. The soft shelled crab had a sad heavy coating and lacked flavour. The noodles with the remaining duck meat were very bland. The clay pot chicken was definitely the best part of the meal. We were encouraged to have rice dumplings for dessert, these were small chewing gum textured balls with dried longon, wolfberries and lotus bean paste in a warm sweet liquid. Sounded great but they were AWFUL! Cost approximately £90 and we came out hungry. Not to be recommended."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Feedback on Food & Service,40,01-09-14,"First of all, I need to highlight that items that I ordered are all in Individual portion. Food is served in per plate per pax. I was puzzled that presentation and serving of food was all served together! First came my soup, Almond with Fish Maw Soup very quickly follow by appetiser Soft Shell Crab w Salted Egg which is fine. Quite immediately after appetiser is served came Peking Duck with Foie Gras, by which time we were struggling to drink the soup, eat the crab and Peking Dark. And the rest of dishes follow suit. When Wagyu Beef with Longan arrive, I was quite annoyed and displeased and told the server to please hold the dishes till we are almost done with at least 70% of what is on the Table. As by which time there are about 8 plates for 2 diners.The last dish Seasonal Veg with Abalone was still served immediately despite my my request to hold dishes till we clear the table.Being Chinese myself, I understand if I order the dishes as a whole plate to share...it's definitely fine to serve few dishes all at one go.But with an individual pax serving..I think the server should have an eye for details ie. be prepared or standby the kitchen when guests is almost done with one of the dish before you present the next. I think it's a normal dining standards for restaurants like Peach Blossom. . The manager who took our order was friendly and cheerful. But the Service staff were kinda impatient...giving that can you help to make way for these plates I'm holding??!!! Service standard was not exactly good as compare to food standard.The bill was $230 for 2 pax. It wasn't exactly a good dining experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Food Good Service,40,12-18-13,"Signature dishes like wagyu beef with longan and wasabi-mayonnaise prawns continued to be very good. Service personnel were very courteous and professional. We couldn't decide on the choice of noodle or rice. Service attendant politely recommended their one of their specialty fried rice, which was a very good choice. He also asked if we wanted the dishes served at the same time (like typical Chinese family meal) or one after another (like Western meals).Restaurant ambience was good - background music didn't overpower conversations, window view of MBS, S'pore Flyer, Mandarin Oriental Hotel & sky made the restaurant bright and wide (not claustrophobic) & pleasant Chinese decor.Complimentary parking is available when dining payment is S$50 or more."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lovely Ambience with birds chirping,40,11-09-13,"We had lunch. The dim sum was very nice with quite a good variety. I don't eat meat, but friends I was with had the Peking duck and it was good. The meat dim sum was also very good.The service is excellent except the uniforms should be looked into. The slim waitresses look very good in them, however the plump and shorter waitresses look terrible in them and there was even one waitress that had a split near the zipper and was walking around without even knowing."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful food,50,10-18-13,"This is an excellent restaurant with wonderful Chinese food, with a more modern approach and dishes you rarely find in other countries. Although this is in an expensive hotel, this was very reasonably priced provided you do not choose wine."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Magnificent kitchen - let down by service arrangements,30,10-07-13,"This must be our sixth or seventh dinner at Peach Blossoms in the Marina Mandarin and we love the chef's signature dishes particularly Almond soup with fish maw and Wagyu beef. We have tried to get them to serve dishes selected sequentially but they always seem to come together without warming stands, so you either race the excellent food down your throat or eat some of it cold. Easily fixed by thinking about service logistics more. Also on this occasion the service was attentive to the point of being irritating - virtually watching you to swallow a mouthful or serve the last items from a dish before whipping it away. All in all felt like pressure to eat and get out, not assisted by the need to rush to eat the food while hot. It was not like this on previous occasions that we dined at Peach Blossoms so we will probably go again and see if we can get the dinner served in a sequence.At the prices charged, the restaurant fails to do justice to its excellent chef and needs to lift its game.David C"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),PEACHY,50,09-27-13,Lovely food & ambience. The menu is extensive & there are also set menus for those who can't decide. The real birds outside in the atrium sing for you during the daylight hours - just enjoy!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing end to our stay,20,08-30-13,"I travelled with my family and on our last night at the hotel we decided to try Peach Blossoms. The food was average and overpriced. We ordered the Peking Duck and could barely eat it. Was full of bones - I've eaten Peking Duck many times and not come across this so not sure what the idea is but a lot was wasted due to the bones.Service was also disappointing as the staff focused on the local customers. It was clear we were toursits and guests of the hotel (perhaps the staff figure we may not return so no need to provide good service?). At one point the chef came out and did the rounds of the restaurant, focusing on the locals - we were all but ignored.Were provided the dessert menu however our waiter never returned to our table so we had to forgoe dessert, get the bill and leave."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Best starter,50,08-09-13,"This restaurant has such great Chinese vegetarian dishes, but what really caught my attention was the free appetizer pickles given as a complimentary starter, I think the best pickled vegetable dishI have ever tasted. I asked for three bowls of it, and was graciously granted willingly with a smile. I would have been happy with that and rice, but am glad I had three other vegetarian dishes which were delicious. Nice ambience. Great service."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),No quality for the money,20,04-21-13,I try to avoid to eat in hotels because the menu there is usually limited and prices high. In cause of Peach Blossom in Marina Mandarin it works - the prices are exorbitant and the food quality is average comparing to the Singapore in the whole.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peking duck a must have!,40,03-17-13,"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Peach Blossom provides contemporary chinese cuisine in a nice quiet setting. I strongly reccomend a party of 4-6 people as any lesser, you wouldn't be able to order an assortment of dishes enough to compliment your palate. To start off, the soft shell crabs in salted egg yokes were delightfully cripsy. It's also not overly salted and the egg yoke coating wasn't soggy either unlike many Chinese eateries. Next up, the Peking duck. It cost about $70 per duck and serves about 15 servings of tiny little crepes packing in the fragrant duck skin, cucumbers and the delectable sauce too. It is unlikely u would stop at 2 crepes. The seafood fried rice with salmon roe was delicious too and to think we polished our bowls thoroughly even towards the end of the dinner is a compliment enough for this simple but tasty dish."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin",40,12-06-12,My first dinner upon arriving in Singapore when I entertained three ladies from my old school. I did not choose the meal but it was very good and I believe we all enjoyed it.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Fine dining indeed,50,10-10-12,"Soft shell crabs, which are difficult to cook without being oily, I always regard them at a test of a true chef, and boy I've been served some horrors. Here they, as was all the food of the highest standard and truly succulent, service was creditable and we would have to give it a massive 10/10, and we never have gone over 8/10 even at our favourite comfort food restaurant, congratulations to the management and staff, they rounded off a wonderful day"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good food and staff,40,08-28-12,"We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for two nights and the restaurant was recommended online.The menu was varied and slightly confusing regarding cost per portion/person.The staff were very helpful in choosing, in serving and in attention to detail. The food was very good, some of the best scallops (chinese style) I have had. For a higher end restaurant with good service, the value was good."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good dim sum, great staff",40,08-23-12,"Am sure there are better dim sum places but because my husband and I didn't have enough time to hunt for one and we were also hungry, we decided to eat at peach blossoms since we were staying in the same hotel anyway. Surprisingly, the dim sum was really good... Not a wide variety but taste was very good... We also had noodles with chicken along with a selection of dim sum, best one is the steamed pork in soy sauce with chopped red chilies! I love spicy food and this was our fave!!!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peach Blossoms,40,08-20-12,Food and service very good...atmosphere was great.....but expensive and drink prices a little over the top
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),The best dim sum I have ever had,50,07-11-12,"I would come and stay at the marina mandarin just to eat here, the dim sum buffet is incredible, and the choice staggering! Beautiful dim sum with attentive staff. My favourite dim sum restaurant in the world!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),elegant,50,07-07-12,we had yum cha on our last day and wished we had of had an evening meal; pricey but worth a treat to yourselves; stick to chinese tea and it keeps the costs down!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good quality Chinese dining,40,05-23-12,The quality of the food was matched by the service.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fake Crab, low quality meats",20,03-21-12,"The buffet is set up to feed the mst food to the most people at the lowest cost - not price. The use of fake crab whensurrounded by sea, offering meat products that are blends like a spam or meat bi-product do not belong in this 3 star quality hotel masquerading as a 5 star. It is easier than going across the way but it is worth it to walk across the bridge to the convention center to the food market there."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Chinese Ever,10,02-20-12,"There is little I liked about this restaurant. Food was bad, service was bad, and the price was high for the bad food and service.Also this location serves shark fin, and does not even know that the rest of the world is stopping this practice. The servers try to creat a more expensive bill by not letting you see the lunch menu. They also do not explain the menu very well. I would definately not recommend this restaurant."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very elegant dining,40,10-18-11,"I thought the atmosphere was very elegant and the food very good. I had one of the Set dinners which consisted of several courses. The wait staff was very attentive and each course was served and allowed the proper amount of time before the next. It is pricey but I found the experience to be very enjoyable and memorable. There is surely food to be found that is as good and at lower prices elsewhere but for elegant dining that will make an impression, give this a try."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice setup and excellent...,30,06-10-08,Nice setup and excellent service...though food is not as delicious as I thought.

The decorations for the peach was beautiful - and it’s complimentary :) Service is really great!Food wise, it was really delicious! Some food recommendations that I have here are:- trio meat ( roasted meat, pork belly and duck meat). Really tasty and I could taste the charred flavours of the meat!- crab fried rice was really yummy as well! Fresh and good - their yam based food is really good too!- fish was great as wellOverall, a great experience! "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food BUT VERY Poor service ,20,07-30-18,"Went for lunch and the food was good. We also requested to see their private room for an upcoming dinner event for 25 pax. When asked for the dinner menu, the senior staff actually told me to see the menu from the website. Are they going paperless?! No! When I request again from another waiter, he brought it to me within split seconds. Next, it was lunch peak hours when we were there, the waitress were busy folding the table cloth and not paying attention to us diners. When we requested to place order for our food, the waitress reacted as if I am interrupting her work of ""folding table cloth"". Thirdly, for a restaurant of this standard, we have to refill our own Chinese tea. Probably they are really short handed..."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Undercover Service Quality Surveyor Ratings,20,09-06-18,"Date: Thursday 6 September 2018, 7pmDexperience Undercover Service Quality Surveyor Ratings:Value 2/5Service 2/5Quality 3/5Ambience 2/5Experience 2/5The verdict is standards dropped badly today, very disappointing. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food BUT VERY Poor service ,20,07-30-18,"Went for lunch and the food was good. We also requested to see their private room for an upcoming dinner event for 25 pax. When asked for the dinner menu, the senior staff actually told me to see the menu from the website. Are they going paperless?! No! When I request again from another waiter, he brought it to me within split seconds. Next, it was lunch peak hours when we were there, the waitress were busy folding the table cloth and not paying attention to us diners. When we requested to place order for our food, the waitress reacted as if I am interrupting her work of ""folding table cloth"". Thirdly, for a restaurant of this standard, we have to refill our own Chinese tea. Probably they are really short handed..."
French,Angelina_MBS,Drinks and light dinner,50,4 September 2018,We walked from the Esplanade to MBS after attending a concert. The walk took us along the floating platform and the Helix bridge. Weather was good for walking. Decided to take a drink and light food at Angelina. We settled for a bottle of Italian pinot gris which was recommended by the captain. It was fruity and good with the food we ordered. We had a club sandwich and a Ceasar salad which were excellent. Service staff tried hard to provide good service. We enjoyed our drinks and food. 
French,Angelina_MBS,Food wasn’t too bad but service definitely in severe need for improvement!,10,19 August 2018,"Went there on a first visit with a few friends for tea time. When we were there, there was a short queue but we soon got seated. Thereafter, the crowd started to die down and there were soon some empty seats here and there. We decided on what to eat after 5-10mins and waved for a waitress to assist us. And we were immediately shocked by her response! When we said, “hi, can we order?” , she responded with a “cannot, I will get back to you in 5 mins”. What kind of customer service is this???After that we finally placed our order, btw we ordered 1 teatime set (which according to the menu comes with a choice of coffee, tea or chocolate - we went for an ice chocolate) and also another 2 glasses of ice chocolate plus 1 more ice tea. In addition, we also ordered another 2 slices of cakes for sharing. The teatime set came first (without the drink), followed by 2 ice chocolate and the ice tea. The ice chocolate which should come with the teatime set never came. We had to remind the waiter for a few times and it was a chaotic situation. After the ice chocolate came, I took a sip of it and 1 auntie came over (instinct tells me it’s the lady boss, maybe?) asked if I drank it because the set came with a different chocolate drink! I’m like ermmm ya drank it already. And her next response was, oh then you have to pay for this drink because it’s not part of the set! Hello, so now I’m supposed to pay for something because of your own internal mistake? Freaking pissed. This was episode 2. After that, we waited another 10 mins for our cakes and had to again remind the waiter to serve. The place wasn’t even crowded and there were at least 4 waiters. In conclusion, service was very bad and I would not pay a return visit even though the food was acceptable. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Food took a really long time to come and came cold,10,31 May 2018,"We had a party of 7, food took more than 40mins to come. Of the 5 pastas we ordered, 3 were cold. It actually tasted nice if it was warm. The fish was bland.We gave feedback that the food was cold.After payment, the staff came to explain that because of our feedback, the service recovery was to waive the cost of ice water. According to him, that's the best the ground staff could do. We didn't even expect to pay for Ice water in the first place!Needless to say, we won't be eating there again!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Failed me! ,30,20 March 2018,I takeaway the mont blanc cake from marina bay sands and the texture is like ut's been there for awhile. The merengue base is stick to the cup.
French,Angelina_MBS,Lunch! Nice service! ,50,13 March 2018,Nice food with tea. This place is less populated so it was a good choice. Delicious and easy on the stomach. Not oily. But I wish they’d serve more salad.
French,Angelina_MBS,Delightful bistro coffee shop in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall Singapore,40,13 March 2018,Angelina is a small intimate and very high quality coffee and pastries cafe in Marina Bay Sands shopping mall Singapore. The bistro cafe is raised above an indoor water feature and has comfortable seating and a high class feel. Very tasty macaroons and cappuccino. Service was slow even though it was not busy. However I was in no rush and really enjoyed this cafe coffee shop.
French,Angelina_MBS,Worse visit ever,10,11 March 2018,"Had high hopes for this place as the Paris branch was great. Service was slow and forgot our orders. Even when the food and drinks came, everything was a mess. There were chocolate marks everywhere on the cup and table, the tea was cold by the time it arrived. Will not bother to come again. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Horrible service,10,3 March 2018,"Went to the branch at marina bay sands for dinner. Only a handful of diners but yet the service was extremely slow. Waited 15 - 20 mins for them to take our orders despite signaling to the waiter a couple of times. They did apologize for being being under manpower but there weren't many diners ! Waiting for food being served is another 20 -30mins and my coffee wasn't even being served and we have to personal walk to the counter many times to request for the sauce which was never delivered. Settling of bill is another pain! One of the waiters whom I believe is the manager simply ignored us a couple of times by doing non important stuff like arranging cups etc at the counter. When the waiter finally acknowledged us , he went to cashier and then walked away leaving us puzzled that instead of punching in the system and preparing the bill, he walked away ... so to summarize , it took another 15 mins to settle the bill! They even billed me for the coffee which was never served! Overall experience was unpleasant and horrible! "
French,Angelina_MBS,A mediocre dinner,30,26 February 2018,"There was no one at the entire restaurant when we had dinner. Food wise, nothing fantastic other than the renowned chocolate drink. I was surprise that the restaurant ran out of salmon when I ordered the Singapore salad. Will recommend the restaurant only when you need a nice chocolate drink or a nice tea. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Below standard,10,18 January 2018,"Firstly, not recommended at all.Food/dessert selection is very limited. At our visit, there were only 5 desserts to choose from, excluding signature Mont Blanc.Food quality is below standard. The shrimps in the pasta was not fresh with the mushy chalky texture. The portion is small. The bacon seems worse than the one in your school sandwich. Totally disappointed."
French,Angelina_MBS,Unimpressed ,30,29 December 2017,"I went to the outlet at MBS today.
Coffee machine was down.
2/4 tea selection unavailable
No Mont Blanc and lemon tart though other cakes were available
Service was slow at every step of the way
Food portions small
There are other options at MBS"
French,Angelina_MBS,Hugely disappointing ,10,10 December 2017,"We first came here a few months ago and left feeling hopeful that there is finally a decent French patisserie in Singapore. 5 visits later, we are sad to say the service and the quality of food has just gone rapidly down the hill. The staff was clueless and ignorant, the food was extremely slow to arrive and the quality was just plain horrid. So safe to say we won’t be coming back for a sixth visit. Not sure how they will survive if this continues but I do wish them luck. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Just OK,30,26 October 2017,Went there for breakfast. The pastries and the scrambled eggs were quite nice. So was the fresh orange juice. The hot chocolate was delicious but very rich. The fruit salad turned out to be from a can topped with some blueberries and a strawberry. The service was nice and prompt. I did not like the atmosphere - either you sit in a dark spot downstairs or upstairs where it all looks scrambled together. Overall value for money regarding breakfast is better elsewhere.
French,Angelina_MBS,SHC,10,18 October 2017,"It was my 1st visit to Angelina as I am Survival Chic's (SC) Member entitled with 30% discount. When we reached Angelina on 15/10/2017 at 6.30pm as per our reservation, it was quite empty except a couple at the back. We were the only diners after they left and remained so when we left. We flipped through the menu and were disappointed that both the selection of food and pastries were very limited. so we decided to have light dinner by ordering a chicken and fish dishes and it turned out that the fish was acceptable at best, but the chicken was quite bad in taste and flavour. This was not the end of our unhappiness. When we settled the bill, I found that 20% instead of 30% discount was given. I asked the only waiter why this discrepancy and was told that the manager (whom was not at the scene, I noticed the waiter made telephone call to him) said so. I contacted SC's Customer Service the next day and SC confirmed that the correct discount should be 30% for up to 5 pax. I would like to presume that Angelina is not a honorable restaurantas compared to another similar type of restaurant, ANTOINETTE, which we have visited many times and enjoyed the food, pastries and services. For sure, I will never go back to Angelina again."
French,Angelina_MBS,Bonjour,40,16 October 2017,"A French restaurant serving good high tea, pastries and dessert. Great ambience and quiet setting. :)"
French,Angelina_MBS,Below average food that's overpriced,30,11 October 2017,"Had the vegetable risotto that came out cold - I don't know if it's because it took almost half an hour for the food to come, which in reason is itself indefensible. Portion was small for something that cost $32 after get and service charge but thankfully I wasn't too hungry then. It surprises me that the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu, having to take a look at the menu with every order we gave. "
French,Angelina_MBS,quite good french food,40,6 October 2017,"food is quite good, service too. My first time there, I may come back one day. Their selection of dishes is good."
French,Angelina_MBS,OK,30,19 September 2017,Angelina's has changed. Has become less upmarket. Not sure if that's a good thing. But I guess it's still ok.
French,Angelina_MBS,Nice chocolate,30,17 September 2017,Nice hot Chocolatiers drinks that can share but it's thick and rich and very hard to finish alone and expensive
French,Angelina_MBS,I don't feel anything yet :(,30,11 September 2017,"~last year after a great dinner night out 4 of us went searching for dessert and stumbled on Angelina, but without any prior knowledge of the hype of this place~a very inviting dessert chiller beckoned BUT an unreal effort of the staff in an almost empty dining area pretty much ignored us standing at the front over the menu stand and when entertained at 8pm Thursday decided to let us know they have to check if we can be seated~it was a WoW moment of disbelief but keeping this to a minimum I'd informed the staff that we're here just for desserts and will take any table anywhere before they let us in (maybe it was an hour and half to closing time???)~anyhoo we had 3 items and I remember nothing of note except the treatment and won't be back ever"
French,Angelina_MBS,Disappointing,30,7 August 2017,"There was much hype on the place when they first opened. We tried the pasta as well as the cakes, both were disappointing. The pasta was average and the cake were too sweet and on the dry side."
French,Angelina_MBS,Value lunch sets,30,29 July 2017,"Ate twice in this restaurant within a week, and had two different experiences.The lunch sets that my friend and I tried offered smart value for money (13.80sgd++ includes a starter, a main and a choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Furthermore, the pastries that we enjoyed for dessert is discounted to only 8sgd, instead of 10/13/14sgd, and the montblanc is divine!) Bill was about 53sgd for two persons.The second time I visited was mid-afternoon, wherein two of us ordered the high-tea set and the third person had ravioli. The latter was commendable; however, the former can significantly be improved. Bill was about 108sgd for three persons.As another reviewer had observed, the hot chocolate served in this branch is awful; it is NOT the same as the one served in Rue di Rivoli:("
French,Angelina_MBS,"The case of a hot chocolate went wrong, tasted horrible and was different to the one in Paris.",20,22 July 2017,"I had the chance to try the original Angelina in Paris, and their hot chocolate is the best I have ever drank. However, the one in Singapore tasted different, and I mean it in a bad way.Angelina's hot chocolate is unique because theirs is known to be super thick and filling. I enjoyed the one in Paris because the rich taste of the chocolate was able to penetrate the thickness, which resulted in a complex but an enjoyable drink. But the one in Singapore is just a poor imitation of this speciality. Yes, it was still thick, but the layered taste of chocolate was not there. It was just a plain thick and bitter. As one reviewer has said, it was a torture to finish it. So, it did not only taste different, but horrible as well.What truly disappoints me that the taste should not have been like this. I almost felt cheated. Ideally, the drink should taste the same, no matter who makes it or where it is made. If Angelina in Singapore cannot recreate the same drink, they might as well change its name in their menu.On the other note, the service is great. Their Mont-Blanc tea is nice, has a flowery, calming smell and pleasant taste. But seriously, that hot chocolate is just plain unforgivable."
French,Angelina_MBS,Yummy Truffle Fries,30,25 June 2017,"I must order the truffle fries every time I'm here. One of the best!
The half cooked egg is well seasoned too and extremely moreish.
The pastries taste particularly fresh on this visit. Every bite brings great satisfaction."
French,Angelina_MBS,Dinner with girlfriend,50,14 June 2017,Environment is good for a lovely dinner for family and couples. Food portion is small but savory to the taste bud. Had a great night of chit chatting with wine paired.
French,Angelina_MBS,Cheapest set lunch in town,30,24 May 2017,"Considering the rest of its menu, the $13.90 three course set lunch is really cheap. However, the portions are small, but you do get to taste its signature chocolate drink. Tried four of its pastries, including the signature Monte Blanc. But it's the Opera that stood out. Wish they would serve more of the items from the opening menu. I missed those! "
French,Angelina_MBS,Great ambience!,50,17 May 2017,It's a cosy place with really good desserts! The staff were polite and attentive. Great service. It's also located near the train station and other local attractions which is a plus point.
French,Angelina_MBS,Nice ambience,40,25 April 2017,Nice place for an afternoon gathering. The dessert was good and their hot chocolate is worth trying!
French,Angelina_MBS,Great Set Dinner,40,25 April 2017,Set Dinner was very good and value for your money especially the smoked salmon salad. The croissant was great as well as the desserts though did not fancy the mont blanc dessert.
French,Angelina_MBS,Pleasant,30,18 April 2017,Pleasant. Had the set lunch. Menu now a bit on the light side. It was not quite enough to fill me. So sad.
French,Angelina_MBS,Service!,50,13 April 2017,It has a great ambience and the staffs were really nice! They have an exceptional customer service. Awesome!
French,Angelina_MBS,Average but cosy spot for afternoon tea,30,2 April 2017,"Tucked away in a quiet spot of the revamped Capitol building, this is a cosy place to rest your feet, enjoy some cakes and good quality tea away from the nearby bustling malls."
French,Angelina_MBS,(:,40,20 March 2017,"Friendly staff, good ambience, nice food. Will be better if the brunch is available all day. Desserts are nice too!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Average food experience,30,13 March 2017,"Food and ambience was so-so, quite disappointed with the hot chocolate which was their signature but the taste turned out a little weird. Overall average experience and overrated."
French,Angelina_MBS,The menu has changed. But not for the better.,30,17 February 2017,The menu has changed. Main courses have been reduced to five. The steak has also been changed and the price has increased from $36 to $45. The café was quiet on a Saturday night and so it was a good place to chat with friends.
French,Angelina_MBS,Average,40,16 February 2017,The food and the ambience still acceptable. The staff is friendly. I hope get more choices for Valentine's Day set menu
French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian Chocolate Style,50,16 February 2017,It's a must place to visit for a chocolate lover. Too bad I have to fly over to Singapore first for everytime I'm craving of the mont blanc dessert. But I will definitely spare my time to visit this place again when I got the chance to visit singapore. Can't wait to go back!!
French,Angelina_MBS,Limited Menu,20,15 February 2017,This place is more of a place for tea. Not suitable for dinner as the menu is very small. The pricing is also quite stiff. A vegetarian pasta cost $29 while barramundi cost $32. Food is average at best. They were also understaffed.
French,Angelina_MBS,Food & cakes not to expectation,30,12 February 2017,"Tried for the first time but disappointed. Mains are not worth the price. Understand that cakes are meant to be sweet but the taste of ""white sugar"" is too strong, tried Mont Blanc, it is bad. Think the chocolate croissant is better. Dine in & spent closed to $180 & packed the half eaten Mont Blanc but was charge $1 for a small box."
French,Angelina_MBS,Excellent Service,50,9 February 2017,"Excellent service (consider we have a toddler with us). The food was great. Compare to Paris's Angelina, The hot chocolate is a little bit more creamy but still, we had a great experience in Angelina Singapore"
French,Angelina_MBS,Dinner for two,40,2 February 2017,Atmosphere was very good. Scallop with black rice dish was really very awesomely unique. Signature monc blanc dessert is a tad too sweet though and truffle fries was so so. Tea selection tasted great.
French,Angelina_MBS,French in a classy way,40,3 January 2017,"Most diners visit the restaurant for coffee/tea and desserts, but I actually enjoy their main course more. During one of my visit, I ordered their macaroons.. perhaps it was pretty late that the macaroons have been in the dessert counter for too long, the macaroons served to me were so tough that i had difficulty biting it. Unforgettable experience!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Food and Dessert,30,30 December 2016,Came here for 1 for 1 with the entertainer app. Mains were good and hearty. Seafood risotto had a bitter aftertaste. Beef stew and sea bass (no snapper that day) was well cooked. Signature mont-blanc was normal and tasted similar to red bean paste. Opera cake was nicer in my opinion because I'm a chocolate lover. 
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food,30,29 December 2016,Food was good but not wow. Cube roll was a bit over cooked. Seafood dishes were nice and yummy. Service was decent.
French,Angelina_MBS,Affordable French Dining at CBD,50,29 December 2016,"Strongly recommend their set dinner. Was very impressed by the chestnut blonc cupcake. Portion is just nice, and the overall food taste is delicious."
French,Angelina_MBS,"great ambience, ok f&b",30,25 December 2016,"We went for their desserts and tea - was probably expecting much more so was disappointed, especially for the price we paid."
French,Angelina_MBS,always high standard......,50,23 December 2016," we are here for a late lunch today. we've been to Angelina in Dubai many times. So when we found out that Singapore has one, we decided to dropby. i orderded my usual Wild Mushroom Risotto while the Mrs ordered her usual Pan Seared Red Snapper Fillet. The food here are always at its very high standard wherever or which ever Angelina you go... excellent!! "
French,Angelina_MBS,Things have Changed!,30,14 December 2016,"Had another dinner there recently. Angelina's appears to be trying to cater to a different market segment now. Red Snapper has been changed to a cheaper fish. No more complementary bread rolls. On the day I went, only 4 types of macarons."
French,Angelina_MBS,Not for me,30,10 December 2016,"I went there due to the popularity of the dessert.Environment: Nice for tai tai high tea, chit chat and tea for few hours. Service is goodDesserts: Very pretty and nice looking. Taste good but all very sweet to me, it sounds funny if desserts are not sweet but it is way over and all of us cannot even finish it as once you ate more, you feel bloated.Price: Mid range, to me it is quite expensive to pay $10+ for desserts"
French,Angelina_MBS,Excellence,50,7 December 2016,Good food and good service! Great place to spend time with friends and family. Definitely will recommend to my friends.
French,Angelina_MBS,cosy and relaxing,30,6 December 2016,"My friends and I were very excited to check out the highly recommended desserts and hot chocolate here, and since it was lunchtime, and they had just started offering a set lunch menu, we decided to check that out too. The set lunch was incredibly good value, with 3 courses. We tried all the mains, and they were all good! To top it off, you could enjoy your Mini Hot Chocolate as part of the set too! Just nice! I particularly liked the Butterfish. We decided to spoil ourselves with their famous cakes. The newly created Mont Blanc with coconut crisps was overly sweet, and not memorable. We all enjoyed the raspberry cake, which had good texture and balance."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good service and dessert,40,2 December 2016,"Overall experience was pleasant. Not too crowded maybe cause it was a weekday evening. Food was good, had seafood risotto and opera cake."
French,Angelina_MBS,value for money,40,30 November 2016,great set lunch no burn pockets great value for dollars gotta go back again....merci.....ne pas parlez vous francais
French,Angelina_MBS,Good desserts,40,29 November 2016,"Everyone should try their Mont Blanc tart!
The chestnut cream is to die for! The overall service was average."
French,Angelina_MBS,Will come back again!,40,28 November 2016,"Finally I visited. Onion soup was awesome. Should try!
I want to try the croque during my next visit! 💋"
French,Angelina_MBS,"Average food, good dessert",40,27 November 2016,Had the beef steak and the seafood risotto. the beef was bland and the sauce didn't match at all. risotto was ok but the seafood had no taste. We ordered the opera cake for dessert which was very good. Would go there again for dessert.
French,Angelina_MBS,Good service but food is not value for money,30,19 November 2016,Their mains are expensive and comes in a very small portion. Note that I'm already a small eater. Also it taste normal nothing fantastic. You can find lot of cheaper and taster meal elsewhere. Their cakes are good though but tad expensive. Average $12 excluding gst and service charge. Frankly I won't go back again even though the service was really good.
French,Angelina_MBS,Good set dinner,40,8 November 2016,Enjoyed the food and the company. Set dinner was very value for money. Portions might be small for big eaters but tastewise was good overall.
French,Angelina_MBS,French desserts!,40,31 October 2016,"I first got a taste of Angelina in Paris and is pretty stoked that there’s one here in Singapore. The French patisserie at Capitol Galleria, Stamford Road, boasts an impressive array of desserts - you won't know which to try first!For the chocolate enthusiasts, their Choc Africain is a must-try. Drown your tastebuds in its chocolate-y goodness, and come back for more"
French,Angelina_MBS,as good as in Paris?,50,26 October 2016,The hot chocolate is a must try - it is as good as the one you would taste in Paris.The service - better than in Paris. The Paris cafe is always very busy and staff seems under great pressure.in Singapore it is not that busy and the staff is really service oriented.
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for Dessert & Drinks,40,23 September 2016,"Love the ambiance of the place.
However it's pretty pricey.
Didn't have much choice of desserts but the taste was not disappointing"
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food worth a visit,50,4 September 2016,"I visited Angelina with my mom. We ordered a soup, 2 mains, opera cake and the signature hot chocolate drink. The signature hot chocolate was very good. The complimentary olive bread goes well with the butter. The food was tasty but a bit pricey. We plan on visiting soon. Location was good as it is easily accessible by bus or train."
French,Angelina_MBS,good food and desserts,40,30 August 2016,"very good french food - flavourful, perfectly cooked. praises all around from our table. desserts were also exceptional.just wish staff were a bit more flexible. wanted to change hot chocolate from promo to the iced version because it was a hot day and they were of same value but was firmly told no because POS system only registers hot for the promo. at least was given a cup of ice but only after much persuasion."
French,Angelina_MBS,"It's not Mont Blanc, it's Flore",40,16 August 2016,"This review is for a visit I did some time back in Dec 2015. Went there with a group of friends for lunch.Obviously we didn't go to Angelina especially for lunch. We were after the Old Fashioned Hot Chocolate L'Africain. Before Angelina Singapore, we need to go to Paris to taste this cup of heavenly chocolate but now it's available near us!I personally enjoy the thick hot chocolate, served with the chantily cream. It's still heavenly, though a friend of us complained a bit that the Singapore version is not as good as what she remembered from Paris.Tried the Pan-fried Scallops on black venere rice with shellfish cream. Scallops were nicely cooked, but I find the whole dish to be too much on the salty side.I almost gave Angelina the average 3 stars rating, but for one thing, I decided to give it 4 stars. It's for the flore. The bright red dessert --- combination of raspberry, meringue, white chocolate, and vanilla mousse --- is one of the best I ever tasted. It is a truly a beautiful dessert. Maybe this is my personal take. Angelina's signature for me is not the overly-sweet Mont Blanc, but the beautiful Flore. I hope they will never take it off the menu, ever."
French,Angelina_MBS,Very Pleasant,40,14 August 2016,"Had a lovely pot-Au-feu there last night. And scallops and black rice. It's pulot hitam for those who understand. But done with a seafood sauce. Quite delicious. The cakes with ok, but could have been better presented, as they were about $14++ each. We had the Mont Blanc and an opera. Service by Hamiz was good. We had a nice table. However most of the other tables were really tiny. More for just drinks, I guess."
French,Angelina_MBS,Not my cuppa hot chocolate,20,4 August 2016,"I'm a hot-chocolate lover! It's my everyday comfort drinkSo when I heard of how good and rich / thick the hot-chocolate was, I went gagaSince I missed the one in Paris, this is my best chance to tryTo my disappointment the drink fail me so miserably. It's overly thick that it's no longer enjoyable. Soon it turns to torture when I had to share that pot with someone else. I sat there for the next 1.5 hours trying to finish it. I think Coco Black has an even better richness than this. Also, they were ravings about its Mont Blanc but it was so dry, lacking moisture. I'm not sure if the one in Singapore is done differently? But it gives me second thoughts on whether I should go to the one in Paris if I'm back there.Utter disappointment..."
French,Angelina_MBS,underwhelming,20,31 July 2016,The coffee was ok (if you like brewed coffee) and the service was good. But this place is somewhat sad as the entire mall does not see many customers. The cakes are way too sweet and not freshly baked (they said they import them from France...). But the biggest drawback is the price. Why would anyone pay these sort of prices for a piece of cake?
French,Angelina_MBS,"Nice place, unusual and hard to find location",30,14 July 2016,"We stumbled upon Angelina by accident. It is not easy to find but we had wanted to go there because we have enjoyed Angelina in Paris.We just had a hot chocolate and a tea and we did eye the delightful-looking cakes, but we were to be having an early dinner soon after, so we held back.The staff were good, very attentive, the place was reasonably empty, atmosphere was very much lacking, but if you want hot chocolate and tea, head to Angelina."
French,Angelina_MBS,Disappointing main courses,20,3 July 2016,"The service was alright, but the main courses we had were bad. The mushroom risotto tasted bitter with just a few strands of mushrooms. The scallop and truffle ravioli was just passable. The signature dessert - Mont Blanc was overly sweet for me."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for lunch ,40,28 June 2016,"It was a good catch girlie lunch. I had the beef cube not sure why they name it beef cube when it's a steak. It was done medium rare exactly what I wanted. Real truffle fries, highly recommended. The chicken breast was not dry as well though I order the beef! Service was good too. The attentive staff pro actively brought a cushion for the baby chair. Nice gesture! "
French,Angelina_MBS,A little bit of France in Singapore,40,20 June 2016,"As a French person having lived in Singapore for 6 years now, it's nice to have a touch of home from time to time. Angelina delivers this with it's Parisian theme. It's also located in a convenient place (Capitol Piazza), which makes it a good go-to place for a break in the middle of the workday, or for weekend brunch. I've been there several times, and it is always a pleasure to share a Mont-Blanc with a friend, and to enjoy their absolutely scrumptious hot chocolate. The main difference is that in France, Angelina is mostly known only for its hot chocolates, teas and pastries. But here in Singapore I tried out some savory dishes, including the Truffle ravioli, the 'Pan-seared duck foie gras', and the pumpkin soup - a good range of dishes from light to hearty. It is also very pleasant to see that the Angelina Team is warm and welcoming, not always easy to find in Singapore - or in Paris in fact! I would definitely recommend Angelina for fellow foodies looking for a tasty lunch or dinner, or a sweet treat."
French,Angelina_MBS,Could be better,30,14 June 2016,"I had a cup of black coffee and a popular le Mont-blanc (dessert: on-top of the muffin size dessert is with chestnut cream, meringue + whipped cream). I've tried many ""mont-blanc"" dessert, I personally still prefer ""mont-blanc - chestnut dessert"" from Japan is still the best. I cant taste the chestnut. I don't really like the combination of meringue with chestnut cream. Is like eating coarse sugar with cream. The coffee (with steam milk) is ok, it comes with a chocolate.Service is good and friendly."
French,Angelina_MBS,Lovely place,40,5 June 2016,"The place is small but I quite like the Parisian feel, although typically in Paris or Europe, the tables seem more far apart, which gives you more privacy. I'm not sure. We had the brunch set. The coffee was alright, hot chocolate was pretty good but a little rich, pastries were good but rather common. The smoked salmon was alright and the half boiled eggs were fun to eat it from the tiny egg holders. The french toast with caramel sauce was a little too much of carbo for me but you could choose the other which I can't remember what it is. Overall, it was an enjoyable brunch, but I prefer somewhere else if it's only for the food. There are better brunch/breakfast elsewhere. I will still consider returning to try their main courses next time. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Interesting dessert,40,3 June 2016,"I had the signature Mont-Blanc at Angelina. Meringue, light whipped cream, chestnut cream vermicelli. Enjoyed this interesting dessert."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Nice place for a hangout, not a meal",30,1 June 2016,"If you are looking for a place to have tea and hangout on a lazy afternoon, this is a good option. Food and drinks are overpriced in my opinion. You are probably paying for the service and the ambience as well. If you are planning to have food there, it is not bad, just not value for money. The only thing that i truly enjoyed was the truffle fries. Even the signature Mont-Blanc was just average. With that price, you could get much better food somewhere else. I had the hot chocolate. Rich and smooth. I would probably revisit another time just to enjoy the chocolate over a nice book or simple tea with friends."
French,Angelina_MBS,An insult to the Paris tea house,10,22 May 2016,"Firstly lets get this straight. Angelina Paris is fantastic. Why they would bother to ruin their name with this awfully local singapore version is a mystery. It's half asleep. No receptionist when u walk in . They get all the orders wrong and don't even understand when you ask for certain items that are on their own menu. When ordering an omelette angelina they bring a club sandwich. When you ask for no tomato in the omelette, they still put it it in ... And guess what.. They used tinned tomatoes in an omelette !!! When you ask for an order a side of potatoes Dauphin they don't know what that is. They omit to bring the side as ""must charge for it "" Waiters are all uninterested in the menu and have a problem understanding an order. The omelette here is half the size of the Paris version ... They probably weighed the eggs and conducted a mathematical profit account before serving it. The only good item on our table was the coffee which was excellent. A total Singaporean comedy ..."
French,Angelina_MBS,Awesome Service,50,1 May 2016,"Love the ambience, furnishing & decoration... No complain about the food & service... All has been perfect from the moment I step in till I leave... Will definitely patronise Angelina again... ☺❤"
French,Angelina_MBS,Brunch so good,40,22 April 2016,"We were looking for a good place for brunch and I saw Angelina appear on one of the food bloggers' recommended places. We didn't even know there's Angelina in Singapore!:) So we decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed. First of all, j'adore les croissants and pretty much any kind of bread, to be honest, so I totally dug the basket of fresh breads that came with our brunch. The omelette was soft and creamy, a perfect complement to the smoked salmon I ordered with it. And last but definitely not least, the thick and creamy hot chocolate is exactly what yummy dreams are made of. Perfect it certainly was! We will be back for sure!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Sweet sweet experience,40,21 April 2016,"Fantastic ambiance, very high end restaurant. Went there for a late tea/supper/dessert after dinner. First time there and the waitress is kind enough to show us an illustrated menu of their desserts to give us an idea of how the dessert looks like, Excellent service. Pastries was great, had no chance to try their beverages thou. Would definitely go back to try."
French,Angelina_MBS,Superb afternoon tea,50,11 April 2016,"Excellent service, good food! Praticularly the foie gras. The pastries were good but not extraordinary but the full experience was superb. This is the only Angelina outside France, take advantage and bisit Angelina SG!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Nothing out of the ordinary...,30,6 March 2016,We went to Angelina in December 2015 and give it a try for their pastries as it was well advertised in various magazines or newspaper. we cant really share all the hype mentioned and it was nothing what sets them apart from a Laduree or Antoinette to be honest. High prices for a slightly more then average quality and service.
French,Angelina_MBS,Not fantastic,30,24 February 2016,The hotchocolate here is good. I think they use some real chocolate chunks mixed with cream or milk because from my table I could see the bartender mixing it up. Apart from that this place is a little expensive and the food is regular.
French,Angelina_MBS,So So. No lines. Hardly any people.,30,16 February 2016,"Looks like it is 2 levels.Cold chocolate wasn't really cold enough. It's like luke warm plus ice. Super rich cocoa. Asked for little cream but it still looks a lot. No Long spoon provided and when I signalled for one, they came with the bill!! They claim it is not normal to include a Long spoon for cold chocolate but then there is no such thing on the menu. Only saw hot chocolate on the menu. But sometimes really really one should use common sense which sadly isn't so common nowadays.I've not had the cold chocolate drink in Paris because the line is usually impossible. So I can't compare.But they are famous for this in Paris and this just doesn't taste 'famous'.They have set breakfasts, brunch, sandwiches, salads, soups, main courses, cheeses, pastries, desserts, macarons, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, Viennese pastries, fruit juices, Soft drinks, beets, champagne, wines and spirits.Just be prepared to pay Angelina prices.There is also a tea time set menu from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for S$49++."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Phenomenal food, excellent service, memorable ambience!",50,26 January 2016,"I had the pleasure of luncheoning at Angelina's recently. What a find! Their truffle ravioli is the perfect rich, velvety comfort food that I'd like to drown myself in after a long day (and might I mention one of the nicest I've tasted in Singapore).The service was impeccable, the ambience makes for the perfect parisienne experience (complete with the essential street-side people watching, even if it's in a mall! :)) The desserts looked sinfully delightful, except I was stuffed by the time they rolled around. But the famed hot-chocolate is on my list of things to try next time - reserved for rainy afternoon with good friends."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Best Hot Chocolate Drink served in a delightful, serious manner.",40,22 January 2016,"What I love from Angelina is the Tarte Tout Chocolate. The crunchy praline biscuit and the soft dark chocolate ganache alleviated the richness of the tart, I couldn't stop savouring in each bite.The other signature of Angelina is the Old-fashioned Hot Chocolate “L’African”. Just like melted chocolate, smooth and rich, this was definitely not for the faint hearted. The portion came in an entire jug, but was served in smaller cups, accompanied with the whipped cream that complemented the cocoa drink. It was perfect for sharing among us.Read more at UrbanOutEaters to know more about my three times visiting Angelina.I always enjoyed my time and my meal at Angelina. Lovely venue, elegant and kind staff, delicious desserts and the best thick hot chocolate served in a delightful, serious manner."
French,Angelina_MBS,Okay... Only.,20,21 January 2016,We had their signature 3-course set menu. Tried the famous hot choco and famous mont blanc- not really good. Just so so. I prefer the Au Chocolat French Bistro at Marina Bay Sands last time. Way better than their menu.
French,Angelina_MBS,All that hot choco goodness,40,17 January 2016,"It's that hot chocolate that would be worth going back to again and again. Thick, comforting, at the right temperature to sip without the singe, cacao wafts soothingly. Didn't add the cream but just ate it straight as if it were a dessert -- it was good cream on its own! Wary of the chestnut dessert as it was too sweet. Very accommodating staff on a weekend considering I had three extra guests on top of my original reservation for four. Staff even reassigned us to a nicer spot. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Enjoyable afternoon ,40,1 January 2016,"Dined at Angelina twice this year 1) Dinner for 2 : good food, although a tad expensive 2) Tea w friends: great dessert (lemon cheesecake is very ""lemony"" which I love) and the Negresco. Great coffee. We sat upstairs and it was an oasis of calm & solitude amidst the busyness of being downtown. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Not that great,30,13 December 2015,"Ordered the famous hot chocolate and it was really very good. Tasted like real chocolate. Just too rich and sweet for me, suggest to share someone if you do order this if not might have sugar rush. I also ordered the lorraine quiche which i thought was really over priced. It tasted like it was microwaved. Nothing special. The salad was very little, just tossed carelessly with some sauce, maybe balsamic vinegar yet doesnt have much taste. The nicest thing on the plate was the cherry tomatoes which i can get from supemarket. So yeah, i am not impressed. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Small piece of paris in singapore,40,8 December 2015,"I know Angelina from Paris, it may not be the best of its kind, but it is still quite good. If you crave a thick Parisian style hot chocolate with decent whipped cream (hard to come by in Singapore) then this is the place. I also like their croque madame "
French,Angelina_MBS,"Great ambience, Fabulous food!",40,27 November 2015,"Had dinner at Angelina solo. Ordered the pan fried scallops...The black rice has a taste reminiscent to our local dessert, the Pulut Hitam and eaten together with the shellfish cream and scallops. Awesome!The dessert I ordered is their trademark classic French pastry, the Le Mont-Blanc consists of chestnut paste vermicelli on top and whipped cream and meringue at the bottom. Fabulous but a bit too sweet!Basically, nice ambience, great staff and strongly recommended!Dr E. Chow"
French,Angelina_MBS,Expensive but Good French Food,40,14 November 2015,"I tried their pork chop grill and shrimp pasta The pasta I wasn't impressed with, but the pork chop was great. Very tender and juicy. They give you complimentary still waterThe hot chocolate is a must try and best if you share it. A fair warning, the hot choco is very thick and fattening but it's worth to try "
French,Angelina_MBS,Hot chocolate to die for...,30,2 November 2015,"Honestly, this is a fantastic hot chocolate. Citron tart or Mont Blanc with it and you'll be very happy. The savory menu isn't wonderful, so just go for sweets."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good brand but poor service,10,23 October 2015,The food is so so but after our meal they charged us twice on our credit card with same bill by recieving alert twice to handphone! We did complain but no responsible until we call our bank to cancel one bill of charging! Later we show the charging transaction from the bank and the duty manager wont accept the mistake! So far that bring down the so call six stars venue... Hmmm
French,Angelina_MBS,"Great Place, Great Food ",50,23 September 2015,"I love the high tea time :) Everything is so yummy, just the price quite expensive but it's worth for me :) And the place located at Capitol Galleria, Singapore great building with lots of great place to eat. More please follow instagram : @xiaolingchan or @nyonyokecil "
French,Angelina_MBS,They are only good at desserts and nothing else,30,20 September 2015,"I was there for a casual lunch with 2 business associates. We ordered the 2 course set lunch ($37++) and shared two desserts. Set lunch consisted of a huge salad, which was acceptable in taste and presentation, and wagyu beef pasta. The beef was hard and the tomato sauce was obviously not freshly prepared. It reminded me of the typical $6-$8 pasta at food courts, which is heated up from frozen central kitchen packages. Although the portion was huge, each of us only finished about half the portion as the quality was bad. We decided to save our calorie quota for the desserts.We shared a chocolate eclair and a choux pastry called Josephine. The eclair was good but nothing extraordinary. Josephine was tart and fruity, so it was a welcome light dessert after the heaviness of the beef and pasta. What saved the day was the mini hot chocolate, which reminded me very much of the thick chocolate which I savoy red very morning when I was holidaying in Spain. How I wished I had a churro to dip into the thick chocolate drink! So, have your main meal elsewhere and go to Angelina just for your dessert. This is the place to be seen on a lazy Sunday afternoon. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian tea room and patisserie ,40,18 August 2015,"Angelina's tea room and patisserie, has been a popular tea room in Paris since 1903. It opened a branch this year in the new Capitol Plazza, home now to luxury brands, Angelina's ambience was a bit disappointing. It was cramped, tables too near each other. We went to try their signature pastries and hot chocolate, to help a friend complete his Singapore bucket list. The hot chocolate was amazing and so was the Mont Blanc. But they're both rich and heavy so best after a light meal. We didn't try the mains. Like all trendy new cafes opening up here, prices are on the higher side. Service was pleasant "
French,Angelina_MBS,Amazing BRUNCH at Angelina Tearoom,50,18 August 2015,"I was so thrilled when I first got wind that THE Angelina Tearoom from Paris would be opening a new branch right here in Singapore! I’d been to the Angelina Tearoom in Rue de Rivoli in Paris (for the curious, it is located near to Westin Paris Vendome). The kewl Tearoom with beautifully decorated interiors once played host to Coco Chanel and Proust who were regulars at the Tearoom. I was curious to know if the Angelina outlet in Singapore could match up to its parent.I’ve read many online reviews criticizing the slow service. Well, just so you know - I NEVER visit a restaurant/cafe/tearoom - during the first 2 weeks of their official opening. You need to give the staff time to be trained and get up to speed! I went after the 3rd week of their opening - on a weekend - at 12 noon and I wasn’t disappointed.It was crowded but they managed to get me a table. The tables here - especially for 2 persons is small. But the cafe brought out additional small tables to ensure that our dining experience would be noting but fantastic. We were served by an amazing waitress named Pamela. After the meal, I was asked to fill in a Feedback form. Needless to say, I gave Pamela and the team full marks for service and everything else listed in the form.I had a wonderful Brunch experience. It really is very value-for-money to have Brunch here. The Angelina Brunch is priced at S$39.00++ per pax and is available until 2.30pm - daily."
French,Angelina_MBS,A must in Singapore for Gluten Free,50,16 August 2015,"It’s a little on the expensive side, but we had a wonderful dinner. Staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free. All in all it was a good experience."
French,Angelina_MBS,I expected more :(,30,13 August 2015,"Well I absolutely loved Angela in Paris and expected the same kind of vibes. Unfortunately this cafe is seriously tiny and feels hidden not as massive and open spaced as the French one. The chocolate drink I had, i think I ordered wrongly feels like I am drinking cocoa. Which means, i can't drink it.."
French,Angelina_MBS,A little slice of Parisian Heaven,50,12 August 2015,"On my recent visit to Singapore, I came across Angelina, a French café in the heart of the city, and decided to indulge myself! It took me straight back to my many visits to Paris. From the delicious hot chocolate to the decadent pastries. It was a great experience and would happily recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore! Oh and if you are a fan of sweet dishes then you must try the Mont Blanc, it’s to die for!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Probably the best bakery IN TOWN 👍🏻👍🏻,50,12 August 2015,Superb service and suit my sweet tooth. Definitely recommending to family and friends. Best experience i've had so far.
French,Angelina_MBS,Bakery at its best....😃,50,12 August 2015,Awesome service. Delicacies was excellent. Friendly staff and helpful. Will recommend to family n friends definitly. Value for money as well...well located...
French,Angelina_MBS,Best Bakery ����,50,12 August 2015,Excellent service and delicious delicacies. Will definitely recommend to my family and friends. Value for money. Will come back for more. Best experience ever.
French,Angelina_MBS,Decent omelette horrible seevice,10,10 August 2015," Decided to try this new place and had to wait for 20mins until we asked a staff of we could grab a seat upstairs. Had asked for mayo for my fries but the waiter was too busy to remember the request. When another came with the dessert, we didn't have forks for the cake. Luckily the lady serving us was still attentive. They really need more training for their staff. Unlikely coming back for awhile "
French,Angelina_MBS,"A place for Sweet Tooth. (Long winded review, Personal experience)",40,27 July 2015,"I been to Angelina twice.The first visit, was during their soft launch. I reached earlier than my friend and served by Joseph. He patiently introduced Angelina's signature dishes and desserts to me and I ordered his recommendation, Mushroom Risotto, Signature Hot Chocolate and Mont Blanc. I personally really love the signature Hot Chocolate and the Mont Blanc, YES, they are SWEET. I read some comments that the signature Hot Chocolate was not HOT. I would say the temperature of the hot chocolate was just nice to drink as a dessert, if too hot, I would not enjoy to continue one sip to another non-stop. (hehe...) I had requested to warm up my hot chocolate again after I finished my Mushroom Risotto. I love the signature Mont Blanc with meringue base, the ""thick"" chestnut puree wins my heart... It was so ""lovely"". The Mushroom Risotto was a bit ""too much""... Joseph saw my face after tasted the risotto, he stepped forward and asked for my comments. I told him, ""It was a moist and creamy risotto, but additional pine nuts had overtake the mushrooms' taste"". He immediately back to the kitchen and informed the chef my comments and asked me if I want to change the Mushroom Risotto to other main course on the menu without any obligations. (I was really embarrassing, I felt I am a picky customer.)Well, I would only say Angelina is too generous.That is really true when my friend ordered a Caeser Salad as she was on diet (Bad timing and she is not a sweet tooth person). When I looked at the Menu, I was bothering by its price on the menu, is at the higher side for a Ceaser Salad. But it is worthy, my friend was satisfied, the portion is enough for 2 person sharing, the ingredients is fresh and delicious. Overall : ☆☆☆ 3.8Food : ☆☆☆☆ 4.0Service : ☆☆☆☆ 4.0 I'm aware they are young who probably less experience in F&B service industry. Give them a chance and they trying to do their best too.Atmosphere : ☆☆☆ 3.5Great Location. But partially of the restaurant was high ceiling, it would be a bit warm during the hot weather especially in Singapore. Solid woods furniture, is grand but heavy. Limited space."
French,Angelina_MBS,No need to go back,30,26 July 2015,"(note: did NOT try the cake, so not an all-encompassing review)Three of us came here at 12pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't full but more people starting coming in at around 1230pm. Ordered an iced tea, a glass of Merlot, truffle fries and the signature hot chocolate (which was SGD12). My friend like the iced tea (I didn't try), she said it was fragrant and had other fruit essences in it so it was like iced tea with a twist. The truffle fries were fine. I was excited for the hot chocolate, but it turned out to be just okay. It wasn't hot enough and was too sweet - yes it's chocolate, but the sweetness balance was off. I actually liked the Max Brenner (Vivocity) hot chocolate better. The tables are really small, we had two tables pushed together and when all the plates/glasses arrived, it felt really packed. Service was okay. Unfortunately the whole area still smells like paint/construction. From what I've read about the Paris branch, this place is definitely not comparable."
French,Angelina_MBS,An Expensive Disappointment!,30,21 July 2015,"Only had cakes and tea. Did not have the signature hot chocolate as it seemed too sweet since it came pre-sweetened. Tea was a signature blend and has a pleasant orange flavour. Ordered three cakes - an opera, a mango passion cheesecake and the mont blanc. Of the three the Opera was the most successful. The cheesecake was the worst as it seemed to have assimilated some of the flavours of other foods it was stored with in the fridge. I cannot explain but it definitely was not pleasant.I wasn't impressed enough to return to sample the other dishes."
French,Angelina_MBS,Bad Experience – pricey and bad taste!,10,19 July 2015,"Due to the local newspaper recommendations, we visited this café on my sister birthday. My intention was to give her a good surprise but ended with a big disappointment.We ordered their famous hot chocolate drink and Mount Blanc cake. For the hot chocolate drink, it turn out very thick, not hot at all and taste like medicine. The worst hot chocolate drink we ever had in Singapore. For the famous Mount Blanc cake, the outer brown colour cream was still hard (not de-froze enough) and obviously the cake was just taken out from the freezer not long ago.The bills was $60.05 for 2 drinks and 2 piece of cakes. We will never come back to this unprofessional café again."
French,Angelina_MBS,Hated this place. Their famous Mont Blanc cake was awful.,10,13 July 2015,"The entire place was really cramped and had the feel of a cafe that was trying too hard to be upmarket (but failing disastrously at it). Service was poor and slow and their famous Mont Blanc cake was probably the most awful cake I've ever eaten in my life, with chestnut cream that was overpoweringly sweet and so dense that you could have stuck a fork in it and not have your fork threaten to fall out at all. Upon checking with the staff, I realised this was because their cakes are flown over from France (which to me, simply means their cakes aren't fresh and which lack of freshness showed up in each bite).Their other signature was their hot chocolate drink. This fared a little better but was too thick and rich to be enjoyed beyond the first few sips.With such stiff competition from other cafes and dessert places in Singapore, it's hard to imagine this place doing well beyond the first 6 months in Singapore."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great atmosphere but strictly ok good..,30,2 July 2015,"Had a rare Monday afternoon off and thought of checking out the new Capitol Piazza when we came across Angelina. We ordered the onion soup, ham and cheese club sandwich and a cold cut/cheese appetizer. The servings were really generous I must say..the onion soup which my hubby had was really nice but the bread of the club sandwich seemed fried and it was quite cheesy too. We ended with a lemon tart which my hubby liked but sour desserts are not my cup of tea. Overall was a pleasant experience..service was very good and I will go back to try their chocolate desserts and maybe brunch menu! "
French,Angelina_MBS,Great place for Tea,40,28 June 2015,"If you have an afternoon off, drop by Angelina . They have their famous Chocolate drink and great choux pastries . Very French !"
French,Angelina_MBS,The desserts might be better...,30,25 June 2015,"We chose Angelina Restaurant / Tea Room because of its quaint, sophisticated beauty and because Coco Chanel frequents this elegant exquisivity (in France itself, of course) often. The exterior suggested a classic touch of elegance while the interior exuded artistic charm and comfort amongst a strong French setting.For mains, *L had the Truffle Ravioli (SGD$29.00) - tiny little jagged squares of pasta stuffed with cheese. Lovers of cheese would gladly indulge in this pasta dish, sinking their teeth into the firm pasta so that the burst of cheese could fill the mouth deliciously - truffle hints were detected amongst the cheesy indulgence.*J went for the Wild Mushroom Risotto (SGD$23.00) - actually all three of us were eyeing this dish. It did not disappoint, not with its rather generous serving of truffles, rocket salad and brothy-rice. The flavour could have been a little stronger, more sapid with mushroom taste, but we were only able to taste it here if we bit into one of the shrooms pieces literally. I also thought that the grains were cooked till too mushy, lacking the bite that I usually enjoy in risotto dishes.For me, I chose to have the Steamed Black Cod (SGD$35.00) served with Shellfish and seasonal vegetables. Black cod always contains a scrumptious buttery smoothness to its texture, combined with a taut, slightly springy tone; the flesh was saccharine. I also enjoyed mussels and clams, being a seafood lover. But oh, the broth, the broth was the ultimate climax - combining the goodness of the seafood and every sip drew out the need to want more; even the soft baby potatoes were sufficiently immersed with the tasty broth.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-angelina-tea-room-patisserie.html"
French,Angelina_MBS,Fantastic Place for chatting and relaxing,30,20 June 2015,"When my hubby and I vacationed in Paris back in 2011, we tried Angelina Paris Patisserie for high tea. The place was really posh and classy with their unique architecture. Of course, the price also a bit steep.My hubby and I feel that it was not bad so we decided to try the newly opened outlet in Singapore. We were there at 2.30 pm and we got our seat without waiting.We ordered Coco tea and their signature Mont Blanc Tea suggested by the staff. Besides, we ordered Angelina Omelette, macaron and lemon tart. However, the lemon tart did not served, probably they forgot about it. I love their tea, it has the coco smell and nice. The macaron isnt the best which i had before but the atmosphere was really great and relaxing. Great place for chatting while having high-tea."
French,Angelina_MBS,Mediocre Pastry Standards,30,18 June 2015,"The Citron Tarte's crust was slightly soggy, Le Mont Blanc's chestnut paste was too sweet and heavy. The taste and texture fail to balance even as we ate it with the cream under the blanket of chestnut paste.Bestie's iced chocolate was not smooth but my marron tea smells heavenly and was delicious.To be honest, I was disappointed because the two standard tarts that I go for didn't meet my expectations for this cafe."
French,Angelina_MBS,A Little Paris in Singapore,40,16 June 2015,"When I vacationed in Paris back in 2014, I stayed near an Angelina Paris Patisserie but never got a chance to dine in because of its queue. Now that we have one at the newly revamped Capitol Piazza, I jumped at the opportunity to check out its goods and validate its reputation.We were lucky to be the only ones in the queue on a Sunday afternoon. We also chanced upon an empty table by the sidewalk. The circular table was petite, to say the least and hardly meant for large meals. Luckily, a rectangular side table was put to good use. Water was served without us having to ask. The menu showcased their cakes, each piece literally a work of art; and also offered other dishes for a fuller and more complete meal.We ordered the signature Le Mont-Blanc (which solidified Angelina Paris' reputation ever since 1903) and the Tentation. As with all cakes, they were sweet and looked temptingly pretty. In fact, it took me all of 15 minutes before I decided to take a bite as I sat there admiring their designs.Service was good but not fantastic as they had to contend with the crowd, ever streaming in but not overwhelming so. At the end, its prices were not unexpected, but to experience a little Paris in Singapore, why not?"
French,Angelina_MBS,8 of us ,40,14 June 2015,"We went as a party of 8. As the place is not big, if you have a big group like us, prepare to wait. We waited for 40 min before we were seated. Service was good despite the fact that they are evidently under staffed.We ordered 3 mains, 2 starters and 4 desserts. The sandwiches and risotto were Gd. The chocolate tart and the opera were my fav even tho Mont Blanc is what they are known for.Overall a gd place to laze around for an afternoon. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Morning pastry and coffee,40,14 June 2015,"Coffee is average but cakes is quite tasty. Felt this place had a classical European touch.Nice environment and relaxed atmosphere. Recommended.. Best thing is that although the restaurant is full on a Sunday morning, you won't find it too congested. Recommended!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Debut,40,14 June 2015,"A new French cafe @ the revamped Capitol theatre.
The service is friendly & prompt at the queue.
Ordering drinks and food is also a breeze with pictorial aids.
The breakfast menu is quite interest.
A must try are the pastries."
French,Paul,Slow service,30,23 September 2018,"Came here for a coffee with some friends. The place is simple and quiet.
The service was rather slow as we waited for a long before someone took our order. The drinks also took a long time to be served."
French,Paul,Poor service,20,20 September 2018,"I have had food from Paul's for takeaway in the past and love the food. No complaints there. But recently we decided to sit down and eat.. over 30 mins before someone served us, even though we asked 3 different people who said they would come soon. We only ordered cakes that were all ready made, took over 10 mins for them to arrive at the table, and drinks order was wrong. The staff were polite enough but seemed to either have too much work to handle or need better systems in place to make it run smoothly."
French,Paul,Rudely turned away,10,12 September 2018,"Paul’s Paragon, Singapore. My family approached and waited at the greeting station to be seated. Many employees saw us waiting. No one approached us or greeted us. We saw an empty table near the back of the restaurant and approached it to seat ourselves. We were promptly and rudely told the table was reserved and they didn’t have a table for us. We will never eat at Paul’s again because of their poor attitude and disrespectful service. I will go out of my way to advise all friends, family and business associates to bypass this restaurant. There is no excuse for poor rude service and attitude."
French,Paul,Delicious food in lovely ambience,40,5 September 2018,"My wife and I had dinner at their branch in Tanglin Shopping Centre. We went there a bit early and there was no queue. I like the ambience very much - quiet and cosy. Service was good. The oxtail was one of the best that I've tried. It is also a bakery shop, selling a variety of bread and cakes."
French,Paul,Crazy busy place,30,4 September 2018,The queue to enter the restaurant was horrendous. But it was worth it for the delicious tarts and Oakley flavoured lattes.
French,Paul,Busy place with stressed staff,30,3 September 2018,"I always loved to come here for coffee and tea, only if I have two or three hours to spare as this place is always crowded and staff take awhile to attend to you. Not for people who have 30mins to spare."
French,Paul,Busy place and yummy tart,30,1 September 2018,This restaurant is very understaffed. Should only go if you are not in a rush. The blueberry tart is yummy .
French,Paul,How on earth can this legacy have excellent ratings.!!!!,10,31 August 2018,"Ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea for S$6,50 good for 1 pax for 2 cups at the Paragon Orchard outlet. Pot of hot water came separately from Paul depuis branded tea bag. No instructions on infusion timing. Soak for 15mins still far from plain water with some yellow colouring. Tasteless of course as tea dust bag is so small with this almost 500ml of water. S$6.50 for a pot of tea maybe a budget for this most expensive city in the world but not an acceptable standard for a legacy restaurant like Paul depuis."
French,Paul,Worst service ever. Don’t waste your time,10,12 August 2018,"My 3rd time eating at a Pauls in Singapore. All experiences have been nothing short of catestrophic. Service on all occasions was utterly disgraceful. On one occasion they didn’t take out order for 25 minutes. When I approached the counter to try and place an order, I was told to go back to my table and that they would come. Except they didn’t. Another occasion, our waiter seemed to be angry that we came and abruptly announced that they had pretty much nothing left on the menu available. This final occasion, one persons meal came after 20 minutes and all the rest took an hour. For simple foods. We had to keep asking for cutlery but we’re only brought one set, we ended up sharing until they finally brought us cutlery."
French,Paul,Very bad service,10,16 July 2018,"They gave us a used spoon. Then forgot to bring the pastries we ordered, then upon being reminded brought us the wrong one & finally came back & said they have run out of the pastry we ordered!"
French,Paul,"Very bad service, the food is ok",20,15 July 2018,"I am a frequent Paul customer, mostly in the US and other Singapore Unit. The food at this Unit is fine, consistent with other Paul Units. However, the service is really bad. This is my third time here, either ordering food in the counter or sitting in a table, the servers are unprofessional, un-polite, and it looks understaffed. In order to get their attention, we need to wave and raise our voice. Once the servers come, they barely stop by your table and listen to you; mostly they take your order “on-the-run” and there is no opportunity to ask any clarification question from the costumers side. "
French,Paul,Terrible food and poor service ,10,8 July 2018,Ordered a steak and the meat was supposed to be cooked medium rare. Parts of it was raw and the rest was chewy. Really poor quality meat. The bread felt like it was baked yesterday and the fries were definitely refried. The creme brulee was the worst I ever had. Overall avoidable place with poor service to top it.
French,Paul,Paul Le Kioske Changi,10,5 July 2018,"Awful service. Rude answers and even showing the hand and leaving.
Terrible sandwich.
Coffee mediocre at best."
French,Paul,Incredibly awful!,10,2 July 2018,"I know Paul from France and they usually serve good food. However, I had lunch with my son at Paul, Ngee Ann City, and it was beyond terrible. He had the ham and cheese crepe and when we pointed out to the waitress that it tasted like the cheese or ham was off, their was no reply. We told her she should let the chef know, but I honestly doubt she informed him. Also, I wrote to Paul explaining the situation - no reply! This is why I am posting my first negative review on TripAdvisor ever. I simply don’t want other travellers to be as disappointed as me."
French,Paul,Zero stars!,10,23 June 2018,"A simple order of apple turnover and palmier took 30 minutes!
We asked for crepes to be delivered later but it arrived before pastries.
The food is so so :-("
French,Paul,Horrendous pastries with equally horrendous service to match,10,15 June 2018,"Food: Croissant was ugly and served without even being toasted. True enough, taste was mediocre. Chocolate cake was dry, totally lacking in flavour and fragrance. To my amusement, they could actually botch up a glass of latte; it tasted so bland that a Starbucks latte even on a bad day easily triumphs it. Service: Inattentive, insincere, ignorant team of service staff who seem like they do not possess a modicum of pride in their work and delivery of service. Requested for a glass of iced water a few times to no avail. Unless ""iced water"" is a completely foreign subject, I do not understand the look of confusion on this one particular lady waitress; she couldn't even be bothered to utter a word in reply appropriately. Overall, don't bother about wasting your money here. You can have better pastries and service elsewhere in Orchard. And yes, even Starbucks. You are welcome everyone."
French,Paul,Terrible Sevice,10,13 June 2018,"Went here for a breakfast and coffee, both were ok. But the service was terrible, one waitress appeared to be actively avoiding and ignoring customers. They seemed completely disorganised. Every person that came in after us had to ask to be served, will never go there again. "
French,Paul,Best pastries ever! Great place for a teatime date!!,50,4 June 2018,"My boyfriend knows that I am such a sweet tooth so he decided to take me to Paul for a teatime date...I completely fell in love with the place! I LOVE the pastries! Best pastries ever!! Beautiful display of pastries, very attractive and colourful. The display sold me. The ambience was great as well, simple yet elegant. I had a hard time deciding on what to get but the service at Paul was wonderful. They were very friendly and especially patient with my decision making! Thank you for the excellent service. I would definitely come to Paul again with my boyfriend and even bring all my friends. I certainly had a wonderful date that day! Thank you so much Paul, and of course thank you to my boyfriend too!!"
French,Paul,Good for takeaway but horrendous for dining in,10,29 May 2018,"We were planning to have lunch at the nearby Japan town when we were at Kinokinuya bookshop. Then our Mother saw this establishment reminding her of the one she patronised in Paris. So we decided to divert and had our lunch here instead.There was a small waiting line outside. Not bad considering it was lunchtime.Then we were ushered to a table at the corner. Good, we thought.Order was taken then the waiting began.The 2 orders of a sandwich and a sausage omelette came earlier. The other 2, a quiche and a spring chicken, took a good more than half an hour after the first 2 orders were delivered.We noticed that the second wave were delivered almost immediately after we asked them to check our orders. Coincidence?The food quality:In general, quite average for the legacy and the price level.We shall stick to takeaways next time"
French,Paul,Worst service with mediocre food.. word Paul ever been to. ,20,26 May 2018,"I am an ardent fan of Paul cafes in Europe.So naturally was thrilled to have Paul restaurants in Singapore.Been to the ones Paul's in Singapore where the food is average. But this Paul in Takasimaya takes the cake ad the worst. Customer service is practically zero. No body actually services you. Its a game trying to get attention of a waiter .And they don't actually look at u when they take an order ,serve . The waitress just dropped the cafe on my fable and rush off.To add to insult, the coffee we ordered were diluted. No coffee taste at all. Both the Caramel Latte and Cappucinno.And don't order the Surprise dessert. It is a surprise as the cream brulee is nothing like it. And the macaroons are so soft u have to chew into it.Worst Paul every been. Hope they really improve a lot. "
French,Paul,I can’t believe how bad the service is ,10,25 May 2018,"I recently ate here and it is by far one of the worst restaurants I’ve ever visited in singapore! Food was quite bland and the service is Just horrible... we had to wait for more than 45 mins to get our food and we had to ask the waiters again to give us water, when we had already asked twice, Croque- monsieur wasn’t too bad but the honey baked chicken thigh with rice was very bland. I couldn’t taste any honey in it and worst of all it had no flavour.Overall, the service and food really left a vey bad taste in my mouth, never will I ever come back here."
French,Paul,SUPER FRENCH CAFE IN THE HEART OF ORCHARD ROAD,50,23 May 2018,"Well done! Enjoyed the wide variety of food choices available! Good quality of French pastries and croissants. Delicious main course dishes and tasty healthy salads in menu; it is difficult to make a choice.Convenient location, A must visit place when in Orchard Road Singapore."
French,Paul,Friendly staff with 👍🏻 recommendation @ paragon,40,23 May 2018,"Surprisingly friendly staff who attended to our table. I brought my parents for routine medical check up and decided to stop at Paul. It is the first cafe other than Toast Box as we walked back to paragon. My first time at Paul and I asked for recommendations. We had avocado scramble eggs and croque monsier to share. It is . Perfect for the elders as we requested for our food to be less salty. The friendly staff as well,was helpful to fill up my parent’s thermal flask with hot water before we left. Will definitely be back for the next check up."
French,Paul,Lunch at paragon ,40,23 May 2018,"My lunch at paul paragon yesterday was super. The beef salad was really good. I simply loved the combination of how the beef was cooked, the refreshing asian dressing and the creamy avocados. My partner had the seafood pasta, seafood was fresh, pasta was cooked to perfection. The tropical blended drink was very nice as well. Service was friendly and attentive. We didnt have space for desserts Will need to come back again for yummy cakes"
French,Paul,very good pastries,50,22 May 2018,"PAUL has the best selection of sweets. the quality is always fresh and consistent, service is fast and good. will come back here always for my sweet cravings"
French,Paul,"Great food, friendly staff",50,20 May 2018,"Went there recently with friends, no doubt that the ambience was good. Staff was really friendly and helped us out with the food recommendation even though it seemed busy at the moment. Food was good and desserts were excellent..!! Love the terrace seats!! Will definitely recommend others!!"
French,Paul,Breakfast meeting,40,20 May 2018,"I am a regular customer of Paul and i have patronise paul in many asian and european countries. I must say, compared to the outlets that i have visited in France, Malaysia or even back in my hometown Jakarta; Paul Takashimaya is definately one of the best.I had breakfast meeting for 8 people last week. We arrived earlier before the opening time and the staff on duty was pleasant, welcoming and accommodative. All of us agreed that everything from the coffee, crossiant, breakfast menu and desserts was magnificent. I personally had cafe mocha, eggs benedict and a mini crossiant. The cafe mocha was creamy, chocolaty and strong. The eggs benedict was simply matchless and the mini crossiant was buttery, fresh and tasted exactly like the ones i had in France. Service was extremely good and fast. Good ambience and easily accessible, i would highly recommend this to my friends."
French,Paul,Quality food; had an exceptional time @ Paul Takashimaya,50,20 May 2018,Had a late lunch with my friends and decided to pop by Paul for some light bites. Staff was quick to recommend a few selection of appetizers and desserts after to try. We had the mango salad & beef tartine to share. It was exceptional. Had chocolate waffle & lemon tart after! Can’t believe how on point the staff was in her reccomendation. Will drop by again if I’m in the area! Thank you so much Paul Takashimaya :)
French,Paul,Top class,40,20 May 2018,"Went to Paul paragon over the weekend last week, service and food was excellent! Though the place was crowded as it was the Mother’s weekend, service was prompt, food was Super good especially the seafood pasta and the desserts were to die for. Will definitely be back! Keep up the good jobs Paul Singapore!"
French,Paul,DISH WATER FOR COFFEE,10,19 May 2018,"Paul's Paragon.I ordered a cafe Medici and it tasted flat, like plain white coffee with no flavour.I explained to a staff who got defensive and made an excuse it only has little bit of orange and chocolate, I couldn't taste anything at all.2nd staff appeared to be defensive yet again and by now causing a quite a Scene! All I asked was to replace s coffee! My husband at this point said change the coffee or refund it.I was served a NEW cup, which tasted like mixture of DISH WATER and dregs of cigarettes mixed in.It was Thick and gloopy.I was shocked to see such bad attitude for such a minor problem, I payed even for the dish waster they served up.I am never going there again."
French,Paul,Poor ambience,20,15 May 2018,"Recently went for a family breakfast. The furniture is so old and worn out. The wooden tables are quite scratched and banged up and the upholstery is frayed on every chair. This just gives a poor ambience.Overall the food and service is okay. However, not all servers use trays to deliver drinks and handle the glasses by putting their four fingers and thumb all around the top edge of the glass where we drink from."
French,Paul,Nice environment with nicely done food,40,7 May 2018,"It’s a nice environment to enjoy your lunch with your friends. I love the potatoes soup. Light & does not feel starchy at all. The Ham & Cheese Crepe is simple & yummy!! The service is above average. The price is on the high side. However, it’s worth the value. "
French,Paul,Choose sweet over savoury,30,30 April 2018,"We came here for lunch and had a chicken salad and chicken salad roll (or pain in French). The roll wasn’t flavoursome or crunchy, the overall taste ok. The salad had a lot of leaves and a very sharp vinegar dressing, and took longer to arrive than the roll! Don’t choose the savoury option here, stick to the sweet offerings and you’ll have a better dining experience."
French,Paul,Paul Le Kiosque,10,30 April 2018,"very bad quality of sandwich, still trying to chew it and the ice coffee latte is like coloured water so it is really not worth"
French,Paul,Great experience and great service,50,24 April 2018,"My friends and I came to Paul(takashimaya) for lunch yesterday and we had a great time. Service was great,very friendly and cheerful service crews. Gave us great recommendation on food and even recommended us to awesome deserts according to our preference of taste. Their food is really good,both presentation and taste. Coffee was awesome, love the coffee in Paul. Not to miss out on their hot chocolate. Overall we had great time in Paul. I will definitely go back there. Thank you Paul."
French,Paul,Great food/pastry and friendly service,40,24 April 2018,Been there for a few times for friends gathering over tea and dessert... love their dessert especially salted caramel tart & the purejee... tried their lunch too... nice and friendly place to dine... keep up the good job!
French,Paul,"Poor, no wonder it was quiet.",20,24 April 2018,"Stopped for lunch, seemed very quiet compared to other places nearby.....
Waitress was pleasant enough, but the food was ‘ok’ at best and fairly pricey for what it was.
There are much better places nearby."
French,Paul,Tea party ,10,22 April 2018,"Most disappointing Very poor service , while the quality of food has been enjoyable in the past today was really the worst I have ever experienced!!! Embarrassed to take friends there and not worth returning.How very sad for the person who made the initial effort to set up the restaurant."
French,Paul,Extremely great service,50,17 April 2018,"Brought my mom to Paul at Takashimaya for her birthday and had a great time there. Before I miss this out, the waitresses even went the extra mile to help me out with choosing the cake for her as she is a very picky eater and to my surprise she actually love the cake they chose."
French,Paul,Great service!,50,17 April 2018,I am very pleased with the service that was provided at Taka. The staff was very prompt and helpful in helping me with my selections. Had a every pleasant experience and will definitely dine here again. Thank you!
French,Paul,It was unexpectedly amazing. Great customer service,40,17 April 2018,Came over to Paul with my family for dinner. The beef burger was really good for its tender and juicy meat. We also ordered the new menu of the honey baked chicken thigh and seafood pasta. It was appetising and I thought it was great for their French restaurant to introduce these local dishes. Staff was friendly and we really enjoyed the meal. Would come back again!
French,Paul,Improved service,40,17 April 2018,"Came to Paul over the weekend, tried the brunch. It was very good and value for money. Service has improved, server was very prompt, the portion was very generous and we really loved the burn orange ice tea"
French,Paul,extremely BAD and TERRIBLE SERVICE!,10,13 April 2018,"ordered chicken breast flute on multigrain and prawn pasta, Only the pasta arrived and they forgot about the sandwich. I reminded them and waited . after 15 mins I reminded them again on my order and apparently the first waitress did not key in the order , the 2nd waiter send my order to another table! by the time my sandwich came is 30 mins later!. NO WORD OF SORRY SAID ! NO APOLOGY! ALL they did is give me a blank look~!!the waitress and waiter are badly 'trained' and rude! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!Good sandwich but EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE!don't even have basis service !shocking!I would rate your service below par!"
French,Paul,the food was great i love the food,40,11 April 2018,i love the food its something new in the menu like the chili crab pasta and the kaya toast. it was good i would recommand my friends to come and try out the new menu.
French,Paul,Terrible Service,10,10 April 2018,"Took more than 30-45 minutes just to get drinks. The service for lunch was even worse they didn’t even get the order correct
Would not recommend it"
French,Paul,Disappointing and misleading menu,10,31 March 2018,"Restaurants from big chains to independent operators increasingly lure diners with menus declaring their “organic,” “locally-sourced,” and premium Wagyu beef status. Restaurants have the right to advertise food and beverage products to properly identify them. To misrepresent menu items is a violation of what is known as Truth in Menu laws. The issue is that you really don’t have a lot of enforcement for false advertising.Here at Paul in Ngee Ann City, it’s less lunch and more the incarnation of every Singaporean’s fearful suspicions about misleading menu. It’s verging on deceit. The smoked salmon on top of baked potato pancake in the menu turned out to be on pale, limp hash browns. Nowadays, it gets a little challenging to define some of these terms. That’s why it’s difficult to hold restaurants accountable who don’t serve what they say they’re serving.In the meantime, I will be vigilant about the food I order by educating myself about the foods and phraseology . This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
French,Paul,Not Recommended,20,30 March 2018,"Was shopping at Takashimaya and stopped by for lunch. Despite being established in the 1800’s, this local branch didn’t have service not taste on top of list. Ordered the new on menu honey chicken over garlic rice, and vegetable quiche. Took about 30 min before food arrived. Checked was dry and had no honey taste. The quiche was ordinary. Many had to go up to the register to get their bill. Facility either had insufficient staff or management isn’t strong. "
French,Paul,The worst place ever,10,27 March 2018,"I ordered a seafood pasta and one juice for lunch. It took more than 40 minutes for them to serve one dish to a guy who came before me. What's worse, they forgot my order and I had to wait another 20 minutes. I asked them about my food for 3 times but no one came back and told me how long will it take. They were extremely unfriendly and looked unprofessional.Some clams had sand in it and pasta was overcooked.It was the worst restaurant in SG and I will never visit the place again."
French,Paul,Goôd food and wine,40,8 March 2018,"To be honest we only chose this restaurant as it was the only one in the Paragon Mall that served wine. Our meal was served quickly and I had the 3 sausages and mash with onion gravy, being a Brit I disliked the lamb and chicken ones but thats my fault. The staff were friendly but not overly attentive. Good atmosphere. 7/10"
French,Paul,An excellent shrimps salad,40,24 February 2018,"It is a bar restaurant inside one of the many shopping centre of orchard rd.
What is interesting to notice is that this chain of bistro present also in others towns has a quality standard quite high."
French,Paul,AwFULL Service,20,28 January 2018,"The Sgrean chubby aunty on duty on 13Aug2017 at about 16:25HRS was snobbish...at takashimaya outlet. No smile no service at all. If we were not there for a bday celebration, i would have give her a good lecture. Thanks to the cakes flavour thus 2stars instead of one."
French,Paul,I love Paul but not up to standard for outlets in Takashimaya and Tanglin Mall,20,9 January 2018,"I discovered Paul while I was working in banking in Japan in Tokyo in akasaka area,The food was amazing and the service perfect and the shop freshly opened. The Paul in Takashimaya is very nice furnished however the service is incredibly slow slow Sooo slow that you want to go... My husband's stake was cold and they couldn't explain why... I eat there too many times have a lot of examples... However the sandwiches are good. The ones you can take home. Very fresh. This part of the business ""take away"" is very good. But if you want to have a meal there not a good idea. You ll get frustrated. Very On the other hand the outlet in tanglin mall 's service is very good but the place is kind shabby cleaned...I am it is not really really clean sparkly, the take away sandwich here is somehow less fresh and crispy than in Takashimaya outlet. But the restaurant service is way better than in Takashimaya.I like Paul very much and I eat in this restaurant in many countries. I wish they will get better here so I can go here as well...."
French,Paul,It IS The Pastries That Are Good,30,2 January 2018,"We were at the Paragon outlet. The service was ok, and so was the food. My wife preferred the one in Bangkok. She did not like the dood there and her reaction was ""so-so"". I liked the soup of the day...tomato. Other than that I tend to agree with ther that the out let in Bangkok has more variety."
French,Paul,Sit and Relax,50,1 January 2018,"I have been to many PAUL outlets. In Westgate, Paragon and Takashimaya. Its a dessert heaven. They serve very good food and good service as well."
French,Paul,Ok service,30,22 December 2017,"This place is being blasted for service. Not sure why, it's pretty normal to me. Nothing special for the drinks, but tolerable"
French,Paul,Really bad service,10,17 December 2017,"We pop into Paul's at Marina Bay Link fairly often for coffee a pastry breakfast and unfortunately last weekend when we went down for breakfast after ordering coffee and breakfast we waited for about 15 minutes for coffee and when my Wife went up to the counter asking how much longer it was going to be was informed that they were short staffed and she just needed to wait.Firstly make sure you have enough staff, not the customers problem. Secondly and this is important it is now what you say but how you say it, the dismissive nature in which my Wife was spoken to was unacceptable. How sad, so many places to choose from and one staff member creates an atmosphere of pure negativity.I assure you out of principle I will not be returning, albeit I do like the custard slice as an indulgence once in a whileStaff make or break your business!!!"
French,Paul,Terrible service and unprofessional staff,10,16 December 2017,"Went to Paul for dinner but it’s a shame I did not manage to try their food as we left due to bad and unprofessional service. Decided on what to order and waved for the service staff to take our order but did not assist us till we asked for the second time.A full timer came over and did not apologise for keeping us waiting and when we finally get to order the menu we wanted, the waiter smugged and mentioned that it is not available without recommending what is good and available.Avoid this place at all cost as we as paying customers do not deserve this kind of service standard of service staff."
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crowded and bad service",20,11 December 2017,"Food was overpriced for the average quality, ordered truffle fries and the afternoon tea set. only the moelleux chocolate cake was worthy of calories. Staff were lacklustre, requested for chilli sauce twice before they remembered. Even the bill has to be asked for twice. Not worth a 2nd visit. "
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crap service",30,10 December 2017,"I cannot fathom a restaurant which hires young serve staff who cannot communicate with the patrons. I had a frustrating few minutes with an inexperienced non speaking wait staff before u was attended on by what was obviously an older and more experienced staff. I waited inordinately long for cutlery and water. I had to remind various wait staff before I got my water. This marred my dining experience as service is so intrinsic to the dining process. I ordered a steak with two sides which cost $29. The steak was okay (not great). The side dishes were not particularly delectable. There was a long line waiting to come into the restaurant but the restaurant itself had many empty tables. There is work to be done on their seating process. All in all, not great. "
French,Paul,Standard dropped,20,9 December 2017,Haven’t been here for a while. Here for dinner. No queue. Was quite disappointed with the service and food. Service was poor. Food was just so so. Will not come again. 
French,Paul,Over rated and bad service,10,9 December 2017,"Like most of the restaurant and the trends in our customer service. Paul at Ngee Ann City has continued to meet the expectation of the “I don’t really care” attitude. Waiting to be seated we were not shown to the table so we were wondering should we wait or..?We go head on our own and when we seated down the waiter just lightly throw the menu. When I asked what’s the soup of the day.. er.. I don’t know I need to check. So a clear first sign you are not ready for that day when the cafe open. I wonder if he know when is his pay day?When the soup and 1st main came just lay on the table without asking who is having which dish. So simple. The staff is one of the experience of what I believe your restaurant or cafe trying to bring to your patrons. No passion, the “I don’t care” attitude is not uncommon here. So cheap is not good and good won’t be cheap. But if one’s passion for what he is doing is measure by the value then honestly that what does this world deserve that person then?I notice no eye contact when they engage with the customer. Well here’s why some overseas brand didn’t survived in Singapore. Not just because the increasing rental but the attitude of the staff. Oh by the way, the attitude to Caucasian customers seems different though. Didn’t know Paul has such practises."
French,Paul,Worst service ever,10,5 December 2017,"I cannot give any comments on food and drinks, they simply never arrived. The inefficiency of Paul's waiter and service brigade is overwhelming. There are so many of them, but they are so poorly organized that you watch them running around and doing all but what you would expect them to do - serving customers in the best, friendliest and most efficient way possible. We only ordered coffee and smoothies but after 20 minutes we gave up and left. Considering the options there are in Singapore, we will prioritize those cafe's in the future treating us as customers."
French,Paul,Went for breakfast but wouldn’t bother again,20,26 November 2017,"Great location, food was ok. but just can’t seem to get it together, ordered two meals that were the same and only got the second when we chased it upSlow on delivery had to chase up items and wait for return of change from billLife’s too short for bad service! "
French,Paul,Extremely poor service,10,25 November 2017,"Don’t understand why people queue up to have lunch at this place. The food is ok, but nothing special. The staff is terrible. Slow, incompetent and unfriendly. Something must be wrong with their facial muscles as they seem incapable of smiling. I waited 15 minutes before someone took my order. I had to draw the attention of the waiting staff three times. As I got seated the people at the table next to me asked for their bill. They repeated that request several times. Their bill came after somebody took my order, i.e. they waited at least 15 minutes. They subsequently had to wait another 10 minutes for their change. That’s 25 minutes to settle the bill! The people at the table in front of me went through the same ordeal to try to order some food. They gave up and left.The restaurant is dirty. I was seated next to a wall which is completely coffee stained. Avoid this place at all cost!"
French,Paul,"Good for lunch on the run, nice decor, food very good.",40,16 November 2017,"Upon approaching Paul in Ngee Ann City we were immediately met by staff who promptly found us a free table at a busy time of the day. A menu was quickly produced and the specials explained. We sought a casual light lunch and were not disappointed; the soup, filled rolls and beverages were very good. The atmosphere was humming as customers came and went at regular intervals. The inside ""dining area"" had stylish décor which added some class to a basically casual, quick stop venue. The staff were friendly and helpful at every turn, helping us with directions as we continued our retail therapy."
French,Paul,Bad service ,10,5 November 2017,"We were attended by waiters who were rude and frustrated with customers and among themselves. Drink came 20 min and food almost 45 min as orders was not put in. Saw waiters went from table to table asking if the dish he was holding was for them. When asked why the potatoes was not cooked inside. First waiter said ‘it’s steamed’ and second waiter said ‘that’s how it serve, raw.’"
French,Paul,Terrible green tea macha frappe,20,26 October 2017,"Didn't read the review before I went. Had a short meeting there with a business associate. The green tea macha frappe has too much milk, no green tea. It's not drinkable. One black coffee and one frappe cost $14.71. Price on the high side."
French,Paul,Misrepresentation of menu,10,16 October 2017,"I went there for breakfast with my wife and was appalled and thoroughly disappointed with the cafe.I ordered Macha green tea frappe and expected something to resemble green tea but what I got was white without any hint of tea. Too much milk.I ordered what was the equivalent of their big breakfast judging from the photos in the menu but the sausages used were entirely different. It looked like the cheap frankurters you get in the supermarket.When I asked the staff why the marked difference in presentation, they replied that I should not depend on photos when ordering food. Sad. They didn't even clean my salad properly."
French,Paul,Nice place but Service is terrible,10,1 October 2017,"I have frequenting Pauls since it opened. Each time, the service gets worse. Today, I asked for water 3 times and ended up getting it myself. 25 mins for a coffee (my wife's came after 15 mins - no idea why they were not served at same time) and 30 mins for a bread basket - an item that requires no cooking, but simply placing precooked items in a basket ! My patience with. Paul's has run out. Pity as the food and location are both good."
French,Paul,Ants inside the food,10,27 September 2017,"I totally cannot understand. It was my first meal. I ordered a course menu so a basket of bread was served. After I take one of the breads, I realised that there were ants inside the basket. When I informed this to a female, she apologised and told me that she will bring another basket. However, I did not want to eat here anymore so I told male staff that I do want to cancel the order. I only had a sip of drink but he still wanted to charge me. I asked him to put the drink in take away cup but I didnt feel like drinking so I threw away. It totally ruined my day and I just wasted money. I will never ever visit here."
French,Paul,Service was very bad,10,26 September 2017,"Me and my mother waited to be shown to a table, but the staff didn't bother to show to a table. I have seen better service in other cafes in Singapore and around the world. I wouldn't go there ever again."
French,Paul,Birthday disaster,10,22 September 2017,"Everything just went wrong. From the first start we ordered bottle water instead it was warm water, and the waiter just put it at the corner of the table and hoping we were the one who will distribute to everyone. Until one of my friend ask her to distribute the water. And the food are taking so much time, for only salads it took over than 45 minutes to come. The same goes for the drink, and also a birthday cake that never come out. The food tasteless The waiters look confused and unprofessional, maybe they don't have a proper training.. will be my first and last time coming here."
French,Paul,No Alcohol ?,10,20 September 2017,"I was surprised and disappointed at finding out that Paul stopped serving alcohol . When I asked why , no credible answer was given .
I suggest this fact is displayed clearly OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT to avoid fooling would-be customers ."
French,Paul,Awful Service,10,16 September 2017,"Have visited this venue on several occasions however this time the service was shocking. We had to wait about 15 to place our order, we only ordered 2 cold drinks and 2 Tuna rolls. The drinks and 1 roll came I had to follow up 3 time and about 20 minutes later the 2nd tuna roll came. They clearly didn't the order right in the 1st place as the waitress appeared to not really concentrating on our table order.. The service was quite shocking, there appears to me no management direction of staff and all staff appear to be serving all the tables so they look like they are running around like headless chicken. And again while waiting for then bill we had to ask several times for this.. the staff appear to be wrapped up what ever task they are doing at that time and not taking into account customers around them.The tuna itself was fine however the salad had seen seen better days and was not fresh "
French,Paul,Ms,50,16 September 2017,"Wow good food. I ordered pan fried salmon with 2 side dishes and it was really tasty and delicious. But it's more high end prices. Good ambience and easily accessible. Located at famous Takashimaya mall and near orchard mrt. Service staff short handed, need to ask 3 times for a glass of water to come. I enjoyed my lunch very much there. It was my first time to patronise the restaurant and I will go back again."
French,Paul,Dreadful service.. not worth the wait,20,9 September 2017,"We came here on a Saturday evening and waited for at least 10m at the maitre'd when there were plenty of available seats. Waiters and Waitresses breezed by with sour expressions. After sitting down, reviewing the menu we asked to order and the waitress came to order. We ordered an all day breakfast, a sandwich and fries. The lady said she would check on whether the sandwich was available and let us know if it wasn't. After 30m, after the breakfast was eaten we asked for the sandwich. She told us that she forgot to tell us there were no more sandwiches, and she forgot to order the fries with the kitchen. We won't be back. It's just not worth it. "
French,Paul,Better to take away,20,6 September 2017,"It was a weekday lunch time, around 1:00pm. I ordered a set lunch and a glass of orange juice. They didn't serve me anything for half an hour, not even the orange juice nor the starter salad. So I told one of the service staff that I hadn't received anything yet. He went to check with the kitchen, and came back, saying my order wrong. I told him my order again, but I didn't receive anything for another 15 minutes. So I cancelled my order and left. I like their bread and pastries there though, so it's faster and better to take away your food from the cashier, though the staff at the cashier is also slow and unfriendly sometimes."
French,Paul,Awful food & service - don't go!,10,31 August 2017,"Just dreadful - service is simply grotesque - slow, entirely inattentive and seemingly focused on just getting through the day... painful to watch but even worse to experience.Food is mediocre at best - dishes arriving with 10 minutes interval for a table of 2 for a quiche and a croque-monsieur, bland taste... just very very poor.Don't go there - no other advice would do justice to this place."
French,Paul,Breakfast ,10,26 August 2017,"Very long waiting time!! ... as more and more in Singapore
The staff is good and doing his best. Mist probably a Management issue.
Don't go!"
French,Paul,Poor service,20,9 August 2017,"We enjoy trying out different cafes around Singapore, and this place has got one of the worst service crew around. What a shame considering the food is actually fairly decent.One particular male staff (could not capture the name but tall and large build) has one of the poorest attitude ever. We were seated for 10mins without being served, so we raised we raised our hands to send him a signal, and got a stonecold look from him. When we were placing our order, he was inpatient and rude throughout.Then, a lady in the next table asked the same staff of her food, he got very defensive in explaining ""everyone is very busy, so you have to wait"". Eventually the lady was served with a rather grumpy look. We could hear the entire conversation plainly because the staff was loud in his response to that poor lady."
French,Paul,Just got to laugh,20,7 August 2017,Went to Pauls Paragon for coffee and cake.The cakes and sandwiches looked great!Sadly thats where the excitement ended.The service is really laughable. In the end i had to just go up to the counter as getting table service was non existent. Tea came with no milk. After going up and asking for milk waited 10 minutes and still no milk. Had to get up again and go look for it.Got told scolded by one of the staff members for moving tables. Even though another staff member helped us move tables and even reset the table for us.Sadly the experience was so bad - you just gotta laugh.At least it was memorable ...more like a visit to Faulty Towers.Nice cup if tea at least! And nice place to sit. And my french pastry was nice.Visit at your own peril. Helps to have no service expectation. Pastries were good.
French,Paul,Always a great Sandwich at Paul Takashimaya ,50,6 August 2017,"I had lunch at Paul today.
I had my Favourite Atlantique sandwich.
Nicely toasted with salmon in between and a cup of latte.
Wonderful food and service.
I think that this is one of the best Paul outlets in Singapore so worth a visit."
French,Paul,Perfect for a quick lunch,40,1 August 2017,"Paul, an old name from France in the bakery business, has set up nice restaurants around its bakery products.Rich salads like the nicoise with seared tuna, excellent sandwiches with home baked bread, the bone marrow which melts on a perfectly toasted tartine. An of course a large choice of pastries for dessert.Decent wines by the glass, fresh juices and of course tea or coffee. Perfect for lunch but also for a lazy afternoon tea.And they have various outlets across Singapore"
French,Paul,The Food is the Saving Grace ,20,30 July 2017,"Located on the 3rd floor of the building, this world-famous bakery/cafe is easily accessible. Indoor and outdoor seats are available.The 3-course set dinner is value for money and the portion sizes are adequate, so kudos to the chef and kitchen team. On the service side, things could greatly be improved.Firstly, the wait staff could be friendlier and offer a smile when showing us to the table. Secondly, the set dinner soup was pumpkin but I overhead later that it was finished and replaced with tomato. No one thought to inform us of the change. Thirdly, the wait for the main course was almost half an hour. We had to signal the staff to bring out the mains. They could have taken notice and apologised for the wait, both of which was expected but none of which was done.Luckily, the food was the saving grace, but we will think twice before dining here again."
French,Paul,Poor Quality / Below par Service,10,21 July 2017,"The service of this Paul outlet is below par. I don't fault the service personnel but the management of the establishment for not providing sufficient training for their staff. Ordered Magret de Canard - Medium. And it came well done. Can you imagine duck breast well done? Tasted like pieces of leather. Fail. And the gratin: burnt. Another fail. The sauce, too thick and starchy; tasted more like gravy. They do dress up their failure with lots of salad over the top though. The mains were also not serve at the same time to the table. My colleague waited more than 30mins for her grill fish. No one came to inform us of the delay. Only upon several prompting did they finally serve the dish. Avoid this outlet at all cost!! "
French,Paul, always love this place...,50,13 July 2017," me and the Mrs were here for a late lunch.. we both tried some new dishes on the menu.. i had the oven baked beef bone marrow with seasalt, served with tartine bread (check out my pictures) while the wife ordered the rack of lamb with rosemary. both are amazing. the bone marrow was excellent, rich and full of bovine goodness. i just wish the bread was slightly more toasted n crispy for the marrow to be spread on!! i would highly recommend the marrow...damn delicious!! "
French,Paul,Waiters that behave like headless chickens,10,6 July 2017,"This restaurant in Paragon should just close down. For me, good food goes with good service because I'm paying for the bill that includes a service charge. I've never been to a so-called restaurant where the service was so atrocious. The waiters were rude and arrogant. The menu looks great but so what when you don't even get served in the first place? Why is it with some of the reviews about their terrible service that this restaurant still continues to operate? The previous restaurant Begazin, was one of the most efficient restaurants we've ever been to. It was nice stopping by for a cup of coffee especially with its great location next to Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. It's shameful in a country like Singapore where efficiency is paramount that this business continues to exist."
French,Paul,Loving it,50,26 June 2017,"Good coffee, good croissant, good sandwiches and macaroons if you are sweet tooth person. Black coffee with croissant, your best teatime buddy!"
French,Paul,Worst cafe experience ever,10,25 June 2017,"Very difficult to catch the waiters attention to take orders, get the bill, etc... get completely ignored, even when sitting in front of them. Food and drinks are alright but not worth the price given the bad service."
French,Paul,Loved It,50,23 June 2017,"Sometimes I just want a good bread roll filled with fresh 'stuff'. I loved this I went here twice, two lunches in a row while I was in Singapore. The baguettes rolls are chewy and fresh and I had the smoked chicken which was beautifully presented with a tasty side salad and nice dressing. The roll was filled with lettuce and tomato and had a really nice mustard mayo. The coffee...well the coffee is real coffee and excellent. Nice staff, great service and very relaxing. Good work."
French,Paul,Very disappointing,20,22 June 2017,"Looks good, but service was really slow and the pastries not that great. A real disappointment as it looked promising."
French,Paul,Worst restaurant in Orchard road,10,13 June 2017,"We had afternoon tea time at the paragon outlet. There were only 3 tables occupied and already been served. We ordered pancake and sandwich. We waited 40 min for our food , our coffee were lukewarm and diluted. Waiters were not interested even if we waved and called 'excuse me'. This is my worst experience in Singapore, bad service and food quality."
French,Paul,Too long,30,8 June 2017,"Our third visit to this place, and this time we waited almost 25 minutes for our beverages. End of the story ☺"
French,Paul,Pretentious,30,4 June 2017,"Went to grab a bite after some shopping, and was throughly disappointed by the service and more important the quality of the food served. For a patisserie, the bread and desert tasted pretty poor , average at best. Service was remarkably poor with staff not cleaning the previous dishes before serving the next one , even more disappointing as I prompted them.... When I got in, most of the tables were empty, but it seemed to fill shortly after with lots of families with children You would expect better service as this is not a cheap place If in the area I would look for better options "
French,Paul,Afternoon tea break ,20,3 June 2017,"Was looking for a rest point in the middle of my shopping and came to Paul's at Ngee Ann City. The tarts was marvellous, we ordered the lemon, raspberry and chocolate flavoured. The lemon tart is slightly sweet with a tangy sourish after taste and was the first to be gobbled up by my kids. Next was the custardy raspberry tart, the custard filling was just right and not too sweet with a generous serving of raspberries on TOP. The Chocolaterie tart was quite thick but good. The cappuccino however was a tad too milky, can't really taste the coffee. The ice lemon tea was ok and nothing much to rave about. The food overall was good with. 3.5/5 stars but the disappointment was the lack of service. Every order we had, the food came without cutlery. The drinks took forever to arrive including a bottled drink which we felt doesn't take much effort to prepare. We ordered a serving of fries and the request for The ketchup did not even arrive even after we have finished. I would recommend a take away cos the place doesn't deserved charging its customers for any service charge. "
French,Paul,Food is very good but slow service. ,20,20 May 2017,"ambiance is very nice. relaxing. but could have been better if they play some french music. Food is sooo good. we tried salad grilled beef and beef tartine.I ordered this chocolate drink topped with whip cream @ $7.90. I requested for it to be served cold. but it was not served with whipped cream.it looks different from the picture on the menu and nothing special on the taste. the server insisted that it does not have a whipped cream. but how come it says on the menu. and when I asked for the whip cream. i was charged additional $1.50, it should have been included on the 7.90 as its stated on the menu!! on top of that I was charged additional $2 because it was served cold and I was not informed when I ordered. I was so upset. i will keep coming back to paul as I like the food but im not coming back to this branch. i dont recommend. try other branch."
French,Paul,"Great place for coffee, crepes and eclairs but the service is poor",30,19 May 2017,"I like the eclairs, crepes and salads but the service is slow, often irritating. It tends to get busy due to the location. Great for takeaway and I love the caprese panini (tomato and mozzarella). I think it's an old favourite boulangerie and patisserie."
French,Paul,Bad Service,10,18 May 2017,"I have been to Paul three times and all those three times has been unpleasant.
Seems like the staffs are always busy and ignored customers, although there are not many customers at that moment."
French,Paul,An Oasis,50,17 May 2017,"I stopped for a late morning coffee after some frenzied power shopping. Paul is an oasis of calm in the busy centre. The coffee is good, as is the range of European cuisine on offer. I will definitely be back."
French,Paul,Lunch,40,16 May 2017,"Roast Rack of lamb , well cooked , tastes good, 3 pieces , just right for light lunch. Cappuccino with dash of hazelnut sauce was fragrant and slightly sweet."
French,Paul,First visit to this outlet,20,13 May 2017,"let down from its name sake. well known in the cafe industry with outlets across the island, this outlet was so poorly staffed and managed and the manager staff who finally showed us a table did not even smile once at all not to us alone but to all who were there. "
French,Paul,Extremelty good service at the Tanglin Branch,50,12 May 2017,I really really loved the service staff at their Tanglin branch. All of them are unassuming and sincere. They don't judge what you order or what you do not order or if you request for free water. Wait staff at the marina bay link outlet are not friendly and pass judgmental look when you do not order drinks with the food
French,Paul,Badly Managed ,10,10 May 2017,"We waited for almost an hour for a cup of coffee, and our frappe did not even arrive because there was a ""shortage of glasses"""
French,Paul,Slow service/food served,20,7 May 2017,"Chipped teapot sprout. Took forever for food to be served and for a request of an additional tea set which eventually didn't come. I don't know, you tell me, I would expect better. Perhaps they need more manpower to run this. I need to commend on this hardworking spectacled server i observed though, he was trying to tend to the many customers as he could. Definitely need more manpower."
French,Paul,"Food as tad salty, but otherwise super yummy",50,3 May 2017,"My husband & I visited because of a promotion. I thought Paul's is more famous for its patisserie, but boy, was I wrong! I tried the lamb rack, bone marrow and escargot. They are perfect! The lamb is well marinated, a bit salty but very delicious. The bone marrow & escargot are perfect! My hubby tried the tenderloin. It's not too bad, but not as great as the rest. The atmosphere is quite good on a weekday, not too crowded - but maybe that's why there is a promotion. The service is also quite good. I'm totally visiting again real soon!"
French,Paul,Worst service,10,1 May 2017,"The service level is not what you would expect from Paul. The outlet at Takashimaya is great, but the staff at Paragon are inattentive, unhelpful and slow. What made my visit worse was that two of the staff started having a heated argument right inside the cafe, all the while ignoring me when I was trying to place my order. At least have the professionalism to have internal arguments at the back of house, not where it is in display to all the customers."
French,Paul,Not what I expect from this chain,20,22 April 2017,Having been to a Paul restaurant several times I thought I knew what I was getting but this experience has left me very disappointed.The service was very slow and we were first served flat Coke which we asked to be replaced. We then had an extra Coke added to our bill. One member of our party was served their main first and had finished by the time everyone else had received their meals. We chose to have a chocolate cake which has to be the worst chocolate cake I've ever ordered at a restaurant. So bad that we didn't finish it. Not to mention it was served upside down on a plate and we were given no cutlery to eat it with. We then had to wait a very long time for the sever to deal with our payment which seemed to take a long time after we had given over our credit card. Very disappointed and I now know I can't rely on this chain to offer good food and good service. 
French,Paul,Doesn't make the grade..,30,17 April 2017,"Paul at Takashiyama, SingaporeHad lunch here. Paul in Singapore, pretends to be a restaurant in its decor and furnishing but the bites served here are the French version of ""le pret-e-manger"" or fast-food +. The crepe Suzette my wife ordered was below average. . Overall I wouldn't rate it more than average. The service was not what one would expect in a restaurant charging the prices it does."
French,Paul,Nice drink; helpful and conscientious staff,50,14 April 2017,"Went in for coffee with a friend. Managed to forget my credit card behind. By the time I realized this, I called the place and was assured that my card was safe with them. When I went to pick it up, I wanted to offer a little thank-you gift to the person manning the register. But she declined saying that this is what they do for all their customers. Much appreciated, especially because I am flying out of Singapore just a few hours later."
French,Paul,Not up to the usual Paul standard,20,12 April 2017,"Took a coffee, sandwich and cake at this venue. The quality of sandwich and cakes was not up to the usual Paul high standards. Sandwich bread was hard and stale, cakes were dated and past their best by date. Disappointing visit. The staff were also unfriendly and not attentive. Needless to say that the prices are very, very expensive but hen again this is Singapore !"
French,Paul,Abysmal breakfast,10,11 April 2017,"The omelette was not cooked through and the sausage cold. It was served on a cold plate and we had waited ages for it. We told the waiter about it expecting him to take it off our bill or reduce it as I didn't eat it, but said he didn't understand and ignored us. Don't go there unless you want to wait a long time for food that should be hot but isn't and served on cold plates."
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and pastries,50,28 March 2017,This is my favourite new cafe to have a long black and palmier. Love the palmier and it's the best I've tasted by far. The set meal is reasonably priced and quality of food is good.
French,Paul,Normal Fruit Tart,30,26 March 2017,"Its my first time trying the fruit tart at Paul and I expect myself to go hoo haa, raving on how buttery and tasty the fruit tart was. Unfortunately, it falls under my expectation for a fruit tart. Of course, the nicest part of the tart was just the fruits, fresh and sweet.Outlet: Westgate (not able to locate Paul Westgate on tripadvisor, thus posting the review here)"
French,Paul,"Mediocre service , more than average food ",10,26 March 2017,"Went for lunch today to get quick bite , service staff should get trained or change they're job ! The food I ordered white and cheese sandwich with I think it's really basic , it was served cut in 2 Mc hot and with some horrible salade ( see pic) Won't go back and will not encourage people to go This is institutional in france or even in Japan but here is nothing "
French,Paul,"Lousy steak, horrible service. Avoid if possible",10,24 March 2017,"Ordered tenderloin steak. Taste horrible. I could get better steak at cheaper price elsewhere.What is even worse is the service and attitude of one staff who served us.We selected some pastries from the pastry counter to be served later. However, they first said that pastries ordered at counter is for take away only (when i been here few months ago and ordered from counter to have it at the table). Then, after checking at counter, they didn't know what we ordered. Lousy food and service.Will never patronise Paul restaurant again."
French,Paul,Typical Breakfast Fare without the Hipster Queues,30,12 March 2017,"I have visited Paul bakery a number of times with family and friends. They have a reliable stable of food options. The quality of food options are great, but not amazing. Their menu is rather pricey for the quality of food, but that is understandable since it is a foreign ""upmarket-ish"" kind of chain.My usual go-to's for a French breakfast are croissants or Pain Au Chocolat. On this occasion, I ordered a Pain Au Chocolat and a Palmier. The Pain Au Chocolat is lackluster and the DIY frozen options from the Tanglin Food Market taste way better. The Palmier is reminiscent of Tiong Bahru Bakery's Kouign Amann. It was good, flakey and buttery, but I very much prefer the Kouign Amann, although they are two different items.Overall, Paul is a good option if one wants a breakfast without the hype and crowd of a hipster place."
French,Paul,More interested in dealing with deliveroo orders than serving customers,20,4 March 2017,"Orchard road branch. A disorganised service team, a manager who spent more time answering online orders than monitoring the status of the restaurant. We were not the only unhappy customers. The food is tasty but the service is worse than it was the last time I went four years ago. Use the take out counter, avoid dining in less reason for disappointment. "
French,Paul,Nice place,30,28 February 2017,"Just looking for coffee, nice place to go, but service took ages and some people say the menu's overpriced."
French,Paul,Afternoon Tea,30,26 February 2017,"For our afternoon tea of today, we decided to go to Paul Cafe at Takashimaya Shopping Mall, Orchard Road, Singapore. Location-wise, it is easily reachable.Paul Cafe originated from France and in Singapore it is located at Level 3 Takashimaya Mall.Customers come in numbers, so prior booking probably advisable.Since it was fully booked, we decided instead to do take-aways. Services were quick and servers were also responsive.For a croissant, a madelaine, a pain au chocolat, and a ""sugar pizza"" we paid SingDol 13.70. I would argue it's reasonable, quality being taken into consideration.The surroundings were also nice and practically while sipping your tea or coffee you could observe the bustling Orchard Road.The cakes tasted good, classic European. I really enjoyed its choco pain.Overall rating is 3/5 as restrooms aren't available inside the establishment."
French,Paul,Overpriced ,20,10 February 2017,Looking for a coffee and sat here. I was prepared to pay $6 for a coffee and while we were there saw lovely smoked salmon baguettes for $7 so ordered two. When we received the bill those same baguettes were charged at $15 each plus 10%service plus GST. We questioned the cost and we were told that the prices in the window were for take away with eat in costing double. It would have been nice to know!Overrated food and coffee. Not recommended. 
French,Paul,Overpriced,20,5 February 2017,"Food was average at best. Chocolate tart was the only decent thing. Iced coffee was comparable to Nescafé 3in1 coffee.
Won't return again"
French,Paul,Food was decent but service a disaster!,10,23 January 2017,"Went for late lunch around 4pm in the afternoon. Only about 4 tables including us. Lady Staff who sat us looks really ""not in the mood today"". But I looked past that since this is the norm in Singapore these days. The male staff serving our table simply made me felt like I was dining in a funeral parlor. Avoided eye contact while serving and just brought the plate to our table without a word expecting us to make a space for him to dump the plate so he can go off. After we were done, he preferred to loiter around shifting forks on empty table than to clear our table. Big turn off and lost my appetite for dessert. When I asked for the bill, the lady just passed me the bill with dessert included. I told her I didn't get any dessert and she should remove it from billed. She just took the bill, cancel it then passed me the updated bill without asking or bothering what happened to he dessert. I will never step in here again and it is utterly disgusting for Paul to include service charge if this is the kind of staff that they can put in the front line. "
French,Paul,yummy pastries sandwiches and everything else,50,22 January 2017,"for orchard road this place falls somewhere between the cheap eat/moderately priced and is high on quality. pastries a must and its one of the few places you can buy proper bread in Singapore, lacks in ambience as well, its in a shopping mall."
French,Paul,Waste of time,10,12 January 2017,"Too much pretense! Service took ages, and the quality of simple breakfast was not good. To add insult to injury the coffee is really bad! It looks nice, but avoid; the are so many good breakfast places to go to as alternative."
French,Paul,"Nice food for a shopping mall, but a staff a bit chaotic",30,11 January 2017,"We ate at Paul in the Ngee Ann City complex on two occasions. The food was surprisingly good for a shopping mall restaurant. We shared a baguette with chicken and salad, with excellent fruit smoothies to drink. The desserts were also very good. However, the staff at the restaurant seem to be run off their feet, even mid afternoon. Whether this is due to lack of proper training or coordination, or understaffing is not clear. It was hard to get waitress' attention to procure a table, order, or pay the bill, and orders seemed to be lost or mixed up some of the time. This restaurant is still worth visiting if you are on a shopping expedition, but it could be so much better if properly managed"
French,Paul,It was okay,30,3 January 2017,"Got a coffee and some dessert, it was pretty average and very pricey for what it was. Coffee was mediocre and cakes were nothing fantastic. Good ambiance and service but food served was just boring."
French,Paul,Decent food but chaotic service,20,2 January 2017,"The pros : classical Paul products The cons : is there someone managing this restaurant ? All staff seem to be running around without any coordination. Tables aren't cleared quickly, causing people to queue even with tables available (albeit not clean). Delivery after order is erratic at best, water was delivered after main dish was eaten !"
French,Paul,Defines horrendous,10,1 January 2017,"This local franchise of the ubiquitous French chain is truly horrendous. Known in France for reliable quality fare, here the brand is going to hell. Firstly, the service is slow and gives new meaning to the word inattentive. A table next to us was heard speculating if they should just leave without paying because getting a bill was taking so long. We also waited forever to be served and to receive our orders, all at a time when the place was far from busy. Then there's what passes for food -- soggy inedible macarons, a moelleux that was stale, hard and dry (the antithesis of the meaning of the cake), and one of the worst cappuccino's I've ever had (how does one mess this up!?), I could go on... It's hard to put a finger on what exactly is wrong here. Is it lack of proper management, is it a belief that a well known brand can prevail over thoroughly mediocre product? Whatever it is, the succession of accurate and bad reviews here should be a wake up call to pull up their socks. And prices are not exactly bon marché. All it has going for it is the location and view."
French,Paul,Promises Promises,30,1 January 2017,"Busy, understaffed, SLOW service.....the coffee was off, the meringues were hard and SOGGY, the matcha frappe was oversweet and odd, and you have to ASK, and ASK for a glass of water. Food does not show and any questioning is answered...you are in the queue. Indeed.Try somewhere else. The promise of standards like Paul elsewhere is...where?"
French,Paul,Awful food. Not worth a penny,10,31 December 2016,Bakery to go maybe ok. But the food is totally crab. Food doesnt look like what was described in the menu and look awful when it landed on table. Cheesy food and not even french nor western. It seems that the outlet has come with its own interpretation as to prepare it. Purist beware! My recommendation. Pls do not waste ur money except u purely eat the bakery. Dont try anything else which are totally horrible.
French,Paul,Bad bakes ,10,31 December 2016,"Horrible bakes, over priced... When there for breakfast, regretted big time... because food TOTALLY SUCKS!"
French,Paul,"Overpriced, Over-rated and terrible",10,30 December 2016,"The header simply says it all. I was with the wife. We have had a long day of christmas shopping. And we were there on a not so busy weekday afternoon.So, no crowd, no one in line for seats, not even packed. In fact, it was fairly empty. We found a table we liked, and told the waitress. It took them 10 minutes to clear and clean the table. Ok ok ok ok... 10 minutes .. I am too demanding you say. My wife went to the display glass cabinet to look at the 'sumptious pastries and other deli offerings' . I sat, and waited for the waiting staff to come back and provide menu. I was thirsty and wanted to at least order a drink while awaiting for my wife to come back to the table. I look around, no staff. Finally saw 2 of them walking around. And I waved my hand, but it seems like I was invisible. Finally after I stood up and walked towards them, they noticed me. I am surprised. Not even a crowded afternoon, and it seems like they were not wanting to have eye contact with the patrons. I saw an elderly couple also (like me) waving for their attention. Oh well, maybe my hand was short, and maybe my skin complexion blended into the background and they didnt notice me.So I ordered 2 coffees, 1 capuccino. I waited for about 30 minutes before the coffee came (and it was LUKEWARM). I asked the waitress to change the coffee for me as i told them it was not even hot. It must have been sitting on the counter for awhile. We ordered a sandwhich, of which I couldn't be bothered to remember now because it tasted dry and horrible. Overall conclusion, give this place a miss. Terrible service, poor quality food."
French,Paul,"Bad service, overpriced, poor preparation of food",10,28 December 2016,"Bad service, unattentive, and poor food. Slightly better than MacDonald
Dont go. Not worth it. Go to subway."
French,Paul,Ridiculous seating,10,23 December 2016,"Went to the outlet at MBFC link mall for lunch where they served reasonably priced lunch sets. My colleague and I were showed to a tiny round table fitted into a right corner of the wall with hardly any leg room for both of us. I am super furious and gave the staff a stern short lecture that I felt embarrassed for PAUL for even thinking of putting a table there for customers. These days seriously, it is clearly revenue over service even for old renowned retail establishments like PAUL. Will never visit again till they clean up their act. A great pity and a big black stain on PAUL's reputation. Hope their parent company revoke this franchise rights!!!"
French,Paul,Nice cafe w a good location but the service is sad,30,22 December 2016,"The brand and location attracts shoppers to stop for drink and bite. Place is nice , food is the norm. However, the service is really making me think twice about coming back here. Either this outlet is super under staff or they just are so busy and worn out look.. - there are empty tables but yet they took a long time to find seats for the patrons in the q - I had to actively look out for staff and asked 3staffs before order is taken- slow in taking order- slow in serving the beverage and cake -both plates actually are pretty worn out with stains on them  Perhaps they can have service staff to just serve some ice water/ warm water and let the guests know they be with them in a min to take order.. conclusion is Come if u got a lot of time to just wait and wait"
French,Paul,Awful service,20,19 December 2016,"We had lunch there, ordered a baguette and a burger. The baguette was old, I almost lost a tooth trying to eat that. The burger was good. They brought our beverages almost when we were finishing our food (after we complained twice). No apologies and no smiles. It took them another 15 minutes to bring me back the menu for some dessert.I wouldn't recommend it. I've been to other Paul's in other countries and they were great, but this one was a complete shame."
French,Paul,"Good food, appalling service",20,18 December 2016,"It seemed a good place to stop and enjoy a typically French snack and coffee. In a way it was. The coffee, tarte au citron and crepe were authentic. But OH DEAR, the service in Singapore is usually exemplar, not here! . We were left waiting to sit down as nobody seemed interested. Then we waited about 20 mins for coffee and longer for food. The same went for the bill. Then my Visa card disappeared for at least 10 minutes while they took it for payment. No smiles, no acknowledgement and hence, no tip. Shame, good food!"
French,Paul,Was better before & overpriced.,10,10 December 2016,"The service really got worse. We have been waiting for a glass of wine for half an hour. Even after 3 reminders still nothing happened. When I informed the manager, the staff even complained ""...we do not have a wine glass, what can I do, is it my problem...?"". Also there was a family first in line of the waiting-que when 3 girls just passed them by, came inside and the staff gives them a table... how can that be? Because this staff was playing with the mobile phone and didn't recognize that the family was first... mamamia..."
French,Paul,Busy at times average coffee,30,23 November 2016,"At times there are long queues, likely due to position and exposure. Nice layout area however the coffee taste average. Good place to park a moment in between shopping."
French,Paul,bad service,20,19 November 2016,"i personally dont come to a restaurant just to eat but also i come for the experience and service, which this place has lack of. most of the waiter were so obnoxious, especially the one who serve us (young local guy with thick framed glasses). the food is just okay for the price, not perfect and a bit pricey for what the serve."
French,Paul,Great Price for 3-course + drink,40,19 November 2016,"Visited the outlet at Marina Bay Link Mall. The set dinner is really very worth it as it comes with a salad or soup of the day , a main (salmon or chicken), a dessert of the day and a drink (iced peach or raspberry tea) for just $15.80++. The portion is generous for the price too. However, it's only available from Mondays to Fridays from 11+am onwards. Public holidays excluded..."
French,Paul,"Great for breakfast and coffee, but...",30,19 October 2016,"Had tried Paul before for coffee and breakfasts before, and certainly their croissants are excellent (if you get them early in the morning when they are freshly-baked), but a recent visit for lunch was somewhat disappointing. If I remember correctly they used to have a pretty good lunch set in the past. But that is gone now. The food is still okay but it's quite pricey for what it is. Though if you want a quick place to grab a decent lunch - even a causal business one - its still okay. "
French,Paul,Very good food. Not just pastries.,40,18 October 2016,"Paul @ Tanglin Mall looks like a normal bakery with a small seating area for those who wants a quick bite. I never knew they have a full selection from breakfast to dinner until my sister introduced us to the place. With a 50% discount from Eatigo, our party of 6 shared 2 salads, 6 mains, 3 desserts and 2 pots of tea for about S$144 only! The food was fresh, nicely done and well plated, desserts wonderful. We had the mushroom and seafood salads, the beef, cod and lamb as mains. For desserts, the bitter chocolate cake in a mound with gold leaf topping (forgot it's actual name), coconut flan and lemon meringue tart did not disappoint. My only small gripe was that the wait staff though competent, was a tad quick to shush us out of the cafe around 8.45pm, granted the closing time is supposedly 8.30pm. Go early if you want a leisurely dinner. The usual pricing is a bit high for the lack of ambience and space but becomes a good deal with the promotional pricing. I would go back again if the promotion continues. I do think people will go back if they reduce their normal pricing slightly to compensate for the lack of ambience and very cramped seating. "
French,Paul,Love this restaurant but not in Singapore ,20,15 October 2016,So this is my second visit a Paul restaurant. The first in paragon. I waited 25 mins for a simple cappuccino and the second here in ngee Ann city. My ears are still sore. Please tell the staff to life the chairs and tables or else put piece of felt on the bottom. It is so sore on my ears. Some of the staff are au fait with what is going on. The rest forget it. The salad was dressed beautifully however. 
French,Paul,Good Selection of Pastry and Sweets,30,23 September 2016,My friends and I have some pastry and sweets for dessert as a take away after our dinner in Ngee Ann City.Some of the food that we had are the chocolate eclair and chocolate mousse. The food are packed nicely into boxes to take home.Taste of the food are of acceptable standard. As the sweetness and pastry are done nicely.
French,Paul,Ok food but useless staff!,20,23 September 2016,"Stopped by here for lunch with a girlfriend. We ordered 2 glasses of champagne to sip whilst deciding on what to eat. The waiter informed us that they didn't serve champagne, only beer! I ordered a cappuccino and my friend opted for tea. We started to browse the menu and surprise surprise, champagne by the bottle or the glass. We called over the same writer & showed him the menu, he looked very vague and said he would see if they had any.The champagne arrived, hooray! The food was fine, nothing exceptional but it was ok.I wouldn't bother visiting again due to the waiting staff who really should grasp the knowledge of what is on offer on the menu - it's not even a vast menu! I guess you get what you pay for & suspect this establishment pay a very basic salary & therefore attract total muppets, shame."
French,Paul,Terrible service and ordinary food at Paragon outlet ,20,22 September 2016,"This review is for the outlet at Paragon mall, which is not in TripAdvisor. Terrible service, we ordered an omelette and a cold sandwich when we arrived and amazingly, the omelette arrived first. I even had the time to eat it before the sandwich arrived, and that was very bland and fairly ordinary. Otoh, the fresh lemonade is really sour and refreshing.The waiting staff are pretty useless and various patrons were constantly having to wave them to their tables to correct mistakes with their orders. Will definitely avoid."
French,Paul,Paul is my fail-safe place. But in SIngapore we were let down.,20,13 September 2016,"I had to ask for the complimentary bread basket, which is otherwise promptly given at Paul, everytime. This was my first visit to Paul in Singapore.Even the food we ordered wasn't upto the mark. Took an unduly long time for the food to arrive. The waiter made a mistake in placing the order. Everything that can go wrong, went wrong that day!But I will still remain a Paul fan."
French,Paul,Service could be better,30,12 September 2016,"I was at Paul @ Westgate with some friends. This was my second attempt to dine here. When I came here the first time, it was for a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't crowded. However, we couldn't manage to get the attention of the staff to place our order. After a while, we left and went to another place to have lunch. This time around, it also took us a while to get the staff's attention despite waving at them and raising our hands to get their attention. We ordered the all-day set. When I asked the staff if they serve hot beverages, she curtly said ""No"". I knew the set came with iced tea but I was hoping I could upgrade and pay a little more for a coffee because I know Paul does serve coffee. Unfortunately, the staff was only interested to taking the set order without any variations. Food was ok and portions were good given that it was a set meal. Unfortunately, I noticed that customers on other tables also had a hard time getting the staff's attention. I noticed that several reviewers here also commented on the service. Perhaps this is something Paul's management should take note of and work on improving its service so as to enhance the overall dining experience for its customers."
French,Paul,Ordered food never arrived inspite of reminders,20,7 September 2016,I had visitors from London and took them around 3 pm for a cake and coffe to PaulsWe ordered our drinks and a few dishes. The waitress repeated the order twice and then left.The dishes my visitors ordered arrived. I had ordered a hot chocolate and a croissant.It was over 45 mins and I had not received anything. I nudged a waiter who was passing by and said that I had ordered a hot chocolate and a croissant. Soon enough my hot chocolate arrived. I waited another half an hour and asked the same waiter again and he said my croissant was on the way. Another 15 mins went by and it was well past 4.30 pm and I could wait no longer. I asked for the bill . When the bill arrived I told the waitress that my croissant never arrived inspite of several reminders. She then ran in and got me the croissant.I could not eat it and just left. Very disappointing service- Infact they were not even busy
French,Paul,Will be back again!,50,18 August 2016,"Recently I was at Paul bakery located at paragon shopping mall. The food was beyond expected, good portioning and was presentable. All the staff had their smiles on definitely very welcoming! Kudos to the team! Will be back again soon!"
French,Paul,Cosy Ambience Diner,40,16 August 2016,"2nd time back here at MBLM. Dinner is much more tranquil as compared to the lunch. Food didn't disappoint again, service staffs are friendly but a little more attentive would be lovely. However, recommends the dishes well. Had the Confit de canard and a dinner set (Mushroom soup, Chicken & Creme Brûlée & Raspberry Ice Tea). Portioning's decent yet satisfyingly filling. "
French,Paul,Excellent food and Good service.,50,15 August 2016,I was at Paul(paragon) last week. The food was amazing really worth the price. Service was great! Good coffee and pastries. A good place to chill. Definitely will back again!
French,Paul,Bad service ,10,14 August 2016,Very Bad and slow service i was waiting for my toast 45 minutes. and very expensive prices.I Think all Pauls work this unfortunate way.
French,Paul,Convenient location,40,10 August 2016,"Paul at takashimaya orchard. Right in the center of shopping area overlooking orchard road. Standard french cafe with coffee, teas and cakes. As expected, price is on higher end."
French,Paul,Arrogant and Rude Service,10,6 August 2016,"Was at the Paul's outlet in Marina Bay ( I did not want to even add the place to Trip Advisor). Service crew there was really not interested to do business. Food was so so and the soup really too sweet. There were no baby chairs and it seemed as though they did not know what they were doing. When the kid with us was babbling , they gave dirty looks and shook their heads especially the manageress. Was disgusted with this level of service so we we paid and left without finishing the food - just lost our appetite. I give this the worse rating I've ever given to a food outlet ( never thought it would be a Paul's outlet though) - ZERO thumbs out of Five.... AVOID EATING HERE !!Honestly if you don't have the crew business, please stop expanding cos you just lost credibility with me and my friends. "
French,Paul,Delightful find on the spur of the moment,50,25 July 2016,"My husband and I were in Singapore for the first time a few weeks ago. We'd been on the hop on hop off Duck tours, and we had done a lot of hopping on and off! We were famished by about 1:30pm, and had no idea where to get a good meal. We were shopping and happened by the Paul Restaurant. First impression was it was very clean and neat. Check! The waitress was knowledgeable. Check! The food was served quickly. Check! And it was delish.....hubby had soup and a sandwich, which I tasted and both were excellent. I had a nice mixed greens salad and cream of mushroom soup. Both also delicious. Oh, and the iced tea was as good as what you get at McAlisters in the US. And that is GOOD tea. All in all, I have to give them 5 stars. There was nothing we didn't like, and if we can remember where we were when we found Pau, we'll be back to eat there again in the future. Great job, Restaurant Paul. Oh, and we also took an eclair to go. Boy was that good. Its a little pricey, but nowadays you get what you pay for, and we don't mind paying for tasty food."
French,Paul,Great dessert place ,40,25 July 2016,"The eclairs never fail to deliver but we decided to try something different. Check out the waffles, chicly decorated and tasted great too. Always a great dessert place!"
French,Paul,It's alright for a start.,40,21 July 2016,"Visited with my Dad for for lunch. They had a Bastille Day promotion on; it was a four-course menu which we absolutely loved. Escargots on toast, roasted cod, asparagus soup, I wish it were on every day. Food is Halal as far as I know it, just that they don't have certification (yet, I heard) as they serve alcohol. To get a four-course meal for the price it was at was a nice deal. Main course portion was too small for me though. Guess it's a norm, but because it's delicious, you'll still find yourself too stuffed for dessert.  Some of the staff could do better in terms of service though, it doesn't hurt to smile, guys!Overall, a wonderful experience and I hope to visit again soon."
French,Paul,Loved it! ,40,11 July 2016,Loved their food. Went there 4 times in a span of 7 days. Had lunch the first time. Chicken ratatouille was super juicy. The breakfasts were excellent. My complete omelette with the smoked salmon was delicious. Fresh orange juice was refreshing. Mom in law and wife had the seared Mediterranean fish which was excellent too. Will try their fancy dessert items next time.
French,Paul,Poor Service,10,9 July 2016,Went for afternoon tea. Not happy with the service as the waiter seemed to be in a bad mood and it showed in his facial expression and actions. Was rude while serving as well as clearing our table. Will not return nor recommend to others.
French,Paul,Good for a snack or meal,40,7 July 2016,"A great place for taking a break from power-shopping. The coffee is very good, as is the comprehensive range of French cuisine. I thoroughly recommend it."
French,Paul,Lunch ,50,6 July 2016,"Paul is never a disappointment no matter which country you're in.We've always found their service and food to be exceptional. Always fresh and great in taste. If you haven't tried Paul, you're missing out. "
French,Paul,Paul @ Tanglin Mall: Service needs improvement,30,4 July 2016,"We decided to go to Paul at Tanglin Mall for brunch on Mother's Day. Being a family of 3 (2 adults and a baby), we didn't book and didn't need to as there were tables available. We ordered a croque madam, eggs, and waffles for dessert. Strangely, the dessert arrived first followed by the croque madam. My husbands savory dish didn't arrive till 10 minutes after the first dish so we weren't too impressed with the lack of coordination of dishes. We also had to get the attention of the wait staff a few times to ask for a second spoon for the dessert, milk for our tea and to enquire about the timing of arrival of my husbands dish. Overall, while the food was good, I wouldn't choose to return unless the service shows some improvement. "
French,Paul,paul paragon branch,40,26 June 2016,"ive visited the paragon branch. you will never go wrong with their pastries, burgers, salads . its heavenly. its slightly expensive but the food is superb. its not even crowded. when you wanna have a quiet and not crowded place, this is the cafe to visit. "
French,Paul,Sunday tea,20,20 June 2016,"A nice cafe for a late lunch. The sautéed mushrooms on French potato pancake was good, but the same can't be said for the pastries. Service staff was a tad non-chalant bordering arrogant. Given the many choices of premium cafes in Paragon, we will give Paul a miss the next time."
French,Paul,Nice place,40,18 June 2016,"If you are in a need of some good pastries and tea, then Paul is the place to go to.I am sorry to say but you can't compare to the Paul restaurants in Europe but you are definitely on the right track.The service needs improvements and also the cups and glassware.Overall the pastries are good and the tea is good.Hope you will change to a better coffee in the near future."
French,Paul,Long waiting...,10,7 June 2016,My last try... And definitely poor service. We have tried a few times and decided no longer coming back due to quality of service.
French,Paul,Great pastries... Service indifferent,40,5 June 2016,"A great place to stop for a break, tea and pastries lovely service was average. Tarts normande was light and delicate. I'd definitely go back for the food"
French,Paul,One of my favourite places,50,19 May 2016,"London, Dubai or Singapore this place never goes wrong. I love everything here - the food, the coffee, the hot chocolate, the desserts, it is all amazing."
French,Paul,"Hate to say it, but I much prefer the Starbucks next door",30,18 May 2016,"Less than ordinary coffee, ordinary service, reasonable Danish pastry, high prices. Title of review says it all really."
French,Paul,Preserved long-life UHT milk used in Paul's coffee?,20,16 May 2016,"When we visited the outlet, the coffee tasted odd, which we later found to be caused by the use of UHT rather fresh milk. We asked the staff about it, but they said they were instructed by their management to use UHT (we're guessing it's because it's cheaper).But they charge coffee at premium prices, so why use cheap, preserved milk? So don't expect a nice-tasting cuppa from Pauls. Resign yourself to that horrible aftertaste of UHT milk."
French,Paul,Food is good but service is poor. Expect to have to chase them to serve you.,30,15 May 2016,"The menu is quite good and similar to cafe styles found in Paris. Food itself is tasty and presented well. Great location and comfortable seating. However the service here is virtually non-existent, the staff seemed to have been trained not to make eye contact at all. They breeze past your table not seeming to notice you are trying hard to get someones attention. Getting the bill is a challenge, you literally need to stand and start leaving to spur anyone into action. Overpriced but not for the food or location just the service is really well below what you would expect for a premium location."
French,Paul,Don't bother,10,7 May 2016,"As per other reviews, the service is so poor and to add insult to injury, on advising the staff that we'd been waiting for a long time with only one meal placed before us, they were rude! I noted that it took less than thirty seconds for the bill to come out. Will find an establishment that is happy about my custom next time. "
French,Paul,Completely forgot my order,10,30 April 2016,"Waited for more than half an hour. Other tables that came after me was served. Really disappointed. No apologies, they just go about their business. Not recommend to any of my friends.
Sickening to the core. Made my visit very unpleasant."
French,Paul,very average,20,25 April 2016,"been to few paul beside singapore.. here is no service
have to call the staff couple of times
food was ok but typica other paul
in the area there are other venue that much better.."
French,Paul,Zero customer service,10,23 April 2016,Service staff need to be trained how to manage customers. 7 customers served by 3 staff - completely indifferent and rude. Had to walk out.
French,Paul,Pathetic service!,10,15 April 2016,"Rude, grumpy, inattentive staff who act like they are doing you a favour. They are gruff. I had to ask 4 times for ice water and they still did not bring it! In exasperation I went and helped myself. The waiter did not know what a flute was-which is part of their breakfast choices.Later, when they served the omellette they forgot the bread!They don't ask if you want anything else.The lady working behind the bar making coffees and juices and serving out the pastries to wait staff is wearing 6 inch heels! Any wonder the coffee takes forever.Ridiculos service-on par with the other sub standard service at Paul's Takeshimaya.ps. The restaurant is not full!"
French,Paul,"Average food, high prices, poor service ",20,3 April 2016,"Moody staff. The kind that greets you as if in pain for giving them more job to do. Waiting to order, two waitresses passing by rushing answered me with ""hold on!, eh?"" ""Gimme a minute! Eh?"". You should train your staff to answer ""one moment please"" (while smiling) not difficult to do so. Upon ordering coffee with macaroni we were told that macaroni flavors are upon availability, meaning, we cannot choose. Can there be more non-sense? The food was ok but overpriced."
French,Paul,Check your salad for big bugs!,10,28 March 2016,"Last Sunday my wife and I had lunch at Paul in Ngee Ann City. We have eaten there maybe 15-20 times in the past already, and although the experience has been mixed, we keep coming back because of the European-styled menu and foods. However, this time was really different. To make a long story short, there was a gigantic insect in the salad my wife had ordered. She had already started the salad and only noticed the big bug when she was about to eat it... needless to say she didn't want any other salad. The staff apologized and said that they buy their salad from an external party and that the Paul staff should have washed it more thoroughly. Anyway, we were both disgusted and after having another dish and a small dessert, we left and will never eat a salad there again. I mean, they prepare this nice salad with vinaigrette and all, really nicely presented on your plate, and they didn't notice the big bug??? So the lowest possible score for this visit. So sad for their reputation, but this has to be the worst thing that can happen in a restaurant."
French,Paul,"Poor Service, Poor Product",20,27 March 2016,"Went to the Paul cafe at Paragon - staff were poor, had to keep chasing to get order. Bring cakes but no drinks, then eventually bring drinks after finished our cakes, then have to ask for milk for the tea...can't even do the basics right! The food and drinks were also poor, so all round it wasn't good and won't be back to this cafe again!"
French,Paul,Small portions,30,22 March 2016,"Portions are rather small and not very appetizing as what one pays for it. Strange that the recipes and food quality are not the same as in other countries. Service is nothing to talk about it .
Such a shame ."
French,Paul,Not bad ,30,19 March 2016,"There is not much to choose from their menu for me . I love multi fruit smoothies , sugar tart and Cesar salad from Paul , but I don't like the rest of my order ."
French,Paul,It's a shame ,10,15 March 2016,I tried this outlet many times. The quality of food is really bad. Either the food is cold or the waffles hard and the coffee is a nightmare.
French,Paul,Average!,30,14 March 2016,"Have tried Paul in London/Bangkok, hence will not skip a try in Paul Singapore Ngee Ann City just for a cuppa. But, a little disappointed, staff not so attentive. Order hot mocha, not at a great temperature, too hot. Macaroons were good."
French,Paul,Reputation is not enough...,20,12 March 2016,"Come on guys. Sitting there, alone, for 15 min, looking in the eyes of staff members at least 20 times, no coffee, no food, waiting to order - and yet no one (!!!) is asking what I need or if I want to order anything. Coffee is good and pastries are even better - very good. But as long as the service is cold and not friendly a cafe is can't be a good cafe. Cafe is an overall experience and this one failed. Even just a small cup of water or, better, a little smile, could grant a third star."
French,Paul,Great customer service and good coffee,40,11 March 2016,Coffee at perfect temperature and great taste - not too strong. Food was delicious. Really nice customer service.
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and snacks ,30,8 March 2016,"Located on the 3 rd level of Ngee Ann City .
Good place to rest and relax after shopping
Service is prompt
Coffee is nice
Nice ambience
Like any other places in Singapore for coffee and snacks"
French,Paul,Not going back there,10,27 February 2016,"I was not amused by the bad service in the first place, but even the quality of the food (breakfast) was extremely sub standard. What do people like on this place? You sit in the poor ambiance of a shopping mall chewing on an uncooked waffle, sipping fresh juice which contains 60% ice cubes, or a cappuccino without even the taste of coffee.I visited ""Paul"" in Jakarta as well, and out there they know what service is, great quality of food and good ambiance. Maybe the singaporean branch should go for a week training in Jakarta how the job could (should) be done."
French,Paul,Overrated and poor service,20,25 February 2016,"Was quite disappointed with the service at Paul. The waiters seem To be disorganised and didn't pay attention much to our needs from the moment we had to sit to our order. We ordered salmon salad which was so so an then had to wait almost an hour for our waffle order to appear (was good but maybe because we were so hungry by then). Not sure what happened because we kept asking about it and the waiter checked, then we asked a couple times and he said it is gonna take 5 min more and do we mind waiting (???)"
French,Paul,"Undercooked, tasteless and doughy crepe champignon (Ocean Financial Centre branch)",20,24 February 2016,"Ordered two mushroom crepes,they came out undercooked and tasteless and badly presented. The crepes were more like thick layers of undercooked flour, with very little mushrooms and cheese. Disappointing and extremely overpriced meal."
French,Paul,Paul (Westgate) - service has improved,30,23 February 2016,"It has been a long while since we last went to Paul at Westgate Mall at Jurong East, after experiencing bad service more than once. So we were pleasantly surprised when both the waitresses were actually friendly and smiley when we had dinner there last night, although service was still slow. Seems the bad reviews did work! The food was not bad, although the serving size could be slightly bigger, especially for the soup. The grilled chicken and baked sea bass were tasty. The dessert was bread pudding, which was apparently very popular but was so so only. "
French,Paul,What is Happening Currently,30,20 February 2016,"It is indeed sad that a cafe of this reputation is not able to keep up to the expectations of customers. With the shortage of labour every food and beverage establishment is facing, it does not seem like improvements to the lack of quality service are going to happen anytime soon. What a shame.Despite the situation, we have always wanted to try out this name brand since we missed the opportunity back when we were in Paris a few years ago. Now that we have, we are somewhat satisfied.The queue did not take long to subside and we got to sit at a table along the passageway. We could peer through the glass panel straight at the cash register. Perhaps it would be wise to have a ceiling-to-wall curtain to block off the view from customers. The menu was comprehensive and had photos to aid the customers and the portions are fairly large for their prices. My partner and I had a turkey ham and cheese sandwich to share and ordered separate mains. Desserts are the highlights here and we ordered the strawberry mille-feuille, light and fluffy. Sweet endings!"
French,Paul,"Poor service, and so so food",20,14 February 2016,"I wonder what is the fuss about this place with the long queue? Decent place, but so so quality food and quite non existence services, left this place much to desire. Will not return."
French,Paul,It's Paul after all.,40,9 February 2016,"Friendly and helpful staff, with a relaxing atmosphere, good for chitchats.We were looking for dessert and the colourful tarts and pies attracted us. There, we were treated to a colourful array of yummy treats, so many that we took a long time to decide what to have. My friend went for the Mandarin orange tart, which is really good - sweet succulent canned oranges on a crunchy tart base, not too sweet and not too tart. With it she had the rosemary lime tea, which I tried and was not very impressed. It is too herby for a coffee lover like me.I had the almond and apple tart (flan Normandy), which was a bit sweet for my preference, but still tasted good. It had roasted almond flakes on top which I loved.. The coffee I had is Cafe Glace, which is fancy terms for an espresso shot with a nice vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate. The coffee is a bit sour in the beginning, so so let the ice cream melt and do its magic, which became very good."
French,Paul,couldn't have lunch :(,10,9 February 2016,"true story worst experience ever . we sat with husband and d 3 kids at Paul Paragon ( restaurant half full) . waiting time to to be seated 10 minutes , to get a menu 10 more minutes . To have a waiter looking at us 10 more . finally , and that the comic part , one lost waiter among many comes to our table and say "" let me talk to the chef , i am not sure to place your order (12:30 pm ) ... 10 more minutes waiting ... waiter comes back and informs us that waiting time is 30 minutes .. we say ok but please take our order now . my husband orders 2 omelettes , cannot finish talking and waiter replies , let me talk to the chef ...seriously , why ?... and comes back , well 35 minutes .. if I were you i woud go somewhere else he says ... best part now , we are preparing to leave , hungry and a little bit upset after 45 minutes for nothing and we see 2 cookers coming from the kitchen , laughing and making their phone calls .. .."
French,Paul,Lot of History but bad service,20,23 January 2016,"I was recommended very highly of this place but my experience was very different. They must choose the most unappealing staff and servers. Our server was very rigid with our requests. I mean you are going pay premium prices so you expect the waiters to be a little accommodating. Besides that, there was only 2 servers which made service very slow. The environment of the restarant and set up is very chic and European and the presentation of pastries, macaroons and pies at the counter is mouthwatering but that's where it ends. Food was average at best.It reminded me of a phrase I learnt many years ago. All that glitters is not gold."
French,Paul,Poor Poor service !,10,23 January 2016,"This so called manager of your paragon outlet has really disappointed us with her level of service . We were seated by your waitering staff at a table and offered a menu. After 10 mins, I waved to this manager for an order , she walked pass and said she will be with us shortly . However , 10 mins passed and she was serving another walkin customer . After which , she went to the kitchen and make her bread?!?. Leaving us stranded for another good 10 mins. Finally decided not to spend my money here and walk off after I gave her a telling off. She seems to realized she forgot abt us!"
French,Paul,"Food is good, service is horrible",30,20 January 2016,All of our dishes came at different times and one was completely forgotten. Not pleasant to have everyone eat at different times!! Couldnt get anyone's attention for a long time. Definetely not a pleasant experience. Sad because the food was good. Service leaves a lot to be desired.
French,Paul,A short break,40,14 January 2016,"We ate there a few times for lunch, you could have a meal or as we did more a light lunch which suited us."
French,Paul,Do not deliver what it pretends!,10,9 January 2016,"A real disaster!
They had no wine, the beer was warm and the meat was of poor quality: nerves and grease on the ""tartine""
I don't recommend this restaurant."
French,Paul,Poor food and Shocking Service,10,4 January 2016,"My wife and I are visiting Singapore to visit family and today chose this outwardly appealing venue for lunch today. It was without doubt the worst mistake we have ever made concerning restaurants in the many years we have been visiting Singapore as the food and service was bad and bordering on Shocking!!Apart from having to wait at least 10 minutes to select a dish, when the meals were served they came up to the table - not together as you would expect but separate with a fair time between each dish being served which made it hard to dine together as we intended.We ordered two seafood salads plus simple dishes of cheese & salad bagette and a meat platter and although the dishes were edible they were far from the standard we were expecting. For example the salds were swimming in viniagette, there was no dressing on the Bagette's salad and the meat platter was smothered in onion (far too much).When it came to personal service..it was literally non-existant even though there seems to be plenty of staff 'running around in circles' achieving very little.The only thing that arrived at the table was the bill and to cap it all they had the audacity to add 10% Service Charge' God know what for.Given our experience today I would advise anyone to steer clear of Pauls in Singapore."
French,Paul,"""Lunch with friends. .",20,23 December 2015,"Lunch with my girlfriends is always a event lots of fun and exciting moments. .And we diced to get lunch in the one of Paul restaurant. .The food is good no question about it. . The bread is so delicious! ! W hen we there the place was busy, and the service was very poor and the staff lost in place ..so sad !!I'm normally calm and friendly to other people, I have to confess I lost my cool side many times ...Looking forward to another visit and im hoping for a better service. .."
French,Paul,Appalling service for mediocre food,10,16 December 2015,"Went for lunch with 4 colleagues. We were seated quickly and ordered fast. From there it was all downhill. Our orders arrived about 20 minutes apart with the last dish to arrive a very simple baguette with some lettuce and cold meat on it. Why did it take so long? One colleague gagged on a piece of cling film not properly removed from his chicken roulade. We advised the Chef who simply lifted the piece of plastic off my colleagues unfinished plate with his none to clean fingers without apology, offer of replacement or to strike the cost of the dish off the bill. We then ordered pastries for dessert. Despite the staff only having to lift them from the display counter literally right behind us again they arrived over a period of 20 minutes and again one by one. My cold cappuccino arrived last after everyone had finished. For this dreadful service and average food we paid a hefty 236 dollars. I noticed many other dissatisfied customers but astonishingly there was a queue of people waiting when we left. Never again! Paul management this place is severely damaging your global reputation!"
French,Paul,Poor Service at Westgate branch,10,13 December 2015,"Yesterday I experienced the same poor service experienced shared by this post in tripadvisor, https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlI wonder if it is the same waitress. Her attitude was the worst. First, no one attended to us when we first entered the restaurant. Then one of the staff indicated a seat. We sat down and this waitress told us the seat had occupants that went to the rest room. We moved to another empty seat and she told us we couldn't seat there because it was a seat for 4. These were obviously two circular tables of 2 placed together to make a 4 seater. The restaurant wasn't even crowded but she insisted for us to move. I left the restaurant and I'm never going back again."
French,Paul,Poor customer service,10,10 December 2015,"We visited Paul with my family during lunchtime. There was lots of customers. The customer service is very poor, we requested the waiter to check the espresso & the strawberry pastry after the rest of food out. It took 10 minutes with 2 & 3 different waiters to assist this small matter. I suggested that the management should educate the waiter that 1 waiter should finish their task, but not 2 or 3 waiters finish 1 task. Besides this, bill payment also took 10 minutes & let customer to wait & wait. Actually all the pastries are ready-made, they need to take & serve customers directly. The pastries are nice! However, the attitude of the waiters draws the customers away. "
French,Paul,"Poor service, would not return (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",10,8 December 2015,"I've visited Paul internationally so was excited to find one in Singapore as I usually enjoyed visiting. However after seating down (ourselves as no one was free to greet us at the door), we waited for 15 minutes and literally ignored, even after glances by the staff members in our direction. The restaurant wasn't even busy but others were being served before us. I had enough after waiting for so long that i approached a staff member at the counter and asked why we were being ignored. They made excuses and said we should have put our hand up, but they weren't looking in our direction enough for us to call out for service. I didn't realise I had to keep my hand up for an extended period to get service. All i received was apologies, and the pastry and coffee was sub-par. Would not return as this place has left a sour taste in my mouth. If you want to be treated poorly this is the place to go"
French,Paul,Excellent food,50,30 November 2015,"The food is very nice, the pastry as much as the hot dishes, try the tourte provençale. A shame about the poor service that drag down the experience."
French,Paul,Perfect Lunch-time break in Orchard,40,25 November 2015,"Easy to reach and to meet at, Paul has a perfectly simple menu that caters to a quick and comfortable lunch in a Bistro-like atmosphere inside a mall."
French,Paul,Poor,10,16 November 2015,"If you like poor coffee, average food, clearing the table yourself, having to go in to order and pay because everyone is too 'busy' then this is the place for you. Otherwise....avoid."
French,Paul,Perfect for a quick and simple lunch!,40,16 November 2015,"At a break time of meeting, I went to Paul and bought a duck sandwich for lunch. I haven't tried this when I was in France and I was surprised for its good taste! A little bit sweat which differs with other tastes and the duck is very fresh."
French,Paul,Nice brunch with very good breakfast options and good French sandwiches,40,10 November 2015,Very good sandwiches and breakfast options including eggs and coffee. Sandwiches and salads are fresh and service was very good. Found it to be a bit pricey though for the quality of food.
French,Paul,a great French dining,40,5 November 2015,"I usually prefer to patronize Paul before noon for a hearty brunch, a time when the crowd is thinner and the queue more acceptable. I prefer a seat within, admiring the interior decor reminiscent of European styles but sometimes I can only get a seat outside of the cafe, staring at patrons of the mall and get stared back in return.Sometimes I get myself a choice from the usual caffeinated suspects, and if I am not up for a cup of tea or coffee, then I would choose from their other beverage selections. I loved their Chocolat Frappé à la Menthe from its Ice Blend section for its menthol sensation mixed well into the rich chocolaty taste, and I feel the urge sometimes to get to this restaurant for a cup of refreshing Lemongrass Iced Tea, its acquired taste a tang against my taste buds.Their menu is quite varied and, of course, very French. So far my favorite remains Roulade de Poulet, a dish of stuffed chicken with pumpkin puree."
French,Paul,Afternoon delight,40,2 November 2015,PAULs do seem to be popping up everywhere. Lovely to relax and have tea and cake in between shopping
French,Paul,Not Good,10,28 October 2015,I ordered a simple sandwich and it was served to me looking old. The cheese was hard on the edges as if it had been sitting out for a few hours. I had to ask several times for the drink I ordered only coming after I was done eating. I expect more from. Pauls located in Singapore. 
French,Paul,Comparing to Paul in Paris,30,26 October 2015,"Been to Paul in Paris and thought just give this one another shot. My second outing to this outlet, first time was when they had the French crew running operations assisting the local guys during their launch and food was replicated superbly well but now I felt it is not as great. Service was struggling to cope but then again it's about the same at some other establishments. Sorry to say this but I'll stick to Paul in Paris. "
French,Paul,Good resturant,50,19 October 2015,"The service they offer in this restaurant was good, even we need to queue for few minutes but they try to make it fast. the food was served quite fast, although they missed my request to have separated sugar for my coffee. overall, I satisfied with this restaurant..."
French,Paul,Classic European afternoon tea ,40,19 October 2015,"With a wide range of places to eat and drink in the Orchard shopping district, here is an ideal (relatively less crowded) place to bring mom and sister for a nice chat. Macarons were not remarkable but coffee and ambience made up for it."
French,Paul,Watery Coffee & Average Baked Goods,10,9 October 2015,"After trying Paul's in Tokyo, which we loved, we were eager to try one of the branches in Singapore. We were at the one in MBFC for coffee and cake. Got a Capuccino, Marochino, croissant, and a fruit tart. Wanted to try some of their other cake but they were out of everything else.The coffee was just rank bad - watery and tasteless. They didn't heat the croissants so they tasted quite faintly of stale butter. The fruit tart was average, nothing to write home about. And, it was quite pricey to boot, which isn't acceptable for this sort of insipid food. Paul's was very disappointing and there was nothing really that could salvage this for us."
French,Paul,Service is just to cry for,10,4 October 2015,"We did not even get to try the food. Sitting for 25 minutes before a staff member even noticed we were just occupying a table.
We could have sat the whole day there without being noticed. Not sure whether they pay their staff actually."
French,Paul,New Paul at Paragon what a mess,10,28 September 2015,"Went to try the new outlet on Saturday September 26 we waited 10 mins to get a table and we waited 15 minutes and waved many times to different waitress to get some attentions and the menus and maybe our order, after 4 times of listening coming and spent 20 minutes we went away.No service attention and I guess reading many other comments from other customers quality and taste of food is not where we expect to be for a restaurant bakery like Paul...Need to improve service in each of the Paul in town"
French,Paul,Worst experience in Singapore ,10,24 September 2015,"My husband and I met up with family here although they'd finished their meal by the time we arrived. We waited in line for a table for a few minutes and nobody acknowledged us just to say ""won't be long"" etc. we were shown to our table and decided what we wanted. I had to ask a member of staff to come and take our order as we'd have been there much longer if I hadn't. My husband ordered a tuna baguette with roasted potatoes and I ordered a pesto and mozzarella flat bread item. After some time my husbands baguette arrived. Ten minutes later the potatoes... I asked a member of staff where mine was and she simply said ""later"" I then asked why we hadn't been given a basket of bread like everyone else around us... She said ""oh you want bread"".... Well yes as everyone else has it! The bread arrived then another ten or so minutes my food arrived. The food was ok but not great. When I asked to pay the bill, the waitress handed it to me then stood over me waiting for me to pay!!! We paid and left then within about 15 minutes we both became unwell with severe stomach upsets! Neither of us had eaten anything else so I can only assume it was down to that meal! Appalling service! Expensive prices! Mediocre food! Never ever again will I return! "
French,Paul,Perpetually crowded,30,24 September 2015,"Food is alright, but dine in experience wasn't that good. Then again you may be better off just to grab and go. Ultimately its standard bakery stuff, above average quality."
French,Paul,You can do better Paul,30,17 September 2015,"I have visited a few of these outlets around the world. When it turned up the food was very good. The issue was it kind of came as and when, rather than hot meals for separate guests turning up together. Unfortunate apparent use of microwave added to the disappointment. The confit duck was lovely, the sides though were lacklustre and you do pay a premium in Singapore so I wont let that go. The layered potato bake sauce had separated, it was lukewarm and had been microwaved. The mushrooms on potato rosti that my friend had appeared to be OK, just OK. Then to dessert. The dark chocolate tart was awesome, so nice that it had to have an opposite to go with it. The lemon meringue tart looked like a properly made meringue on the menu, the reality was piped soggy meringue hit with a blow torch for a minute. Then ordering coffee, the coffee was OK, in french style though I requested cream, was told OK and then milk arrived. When questioned, no cream was available, so why say yes twice...Again, just not good enough. So, not rushing back and lots and lots of options in this shopping centre as well."
French,Paul,Delightful French style cafe (Tanglin Mall branch),40,9 September 2015,"I spotted this quaint little cafe in the mall next to the hotel I was staying in and decided to try it out for breakfast, in lieu of the uninspiring breakfast buffet I had in the hotel that day.Arrived at about 10 a.m. and the place was almost empty, guess I arrived after the rush hour and had most of the place to myself, except for 2 other tables. Had some really nice and thin French style pancakes, an almond croissant and a hot mocha, all very nice and better than most comparable places in Hong Kong and was pleasantly pleased by the experience."
French,Paul,Newly opened Paul at Paragon,20,7 September 2015,"We ordered waffle, crepe, hot chocolate and flat white.Waffle: hard and cold, definitely not freshly made, ice cream taste weird;Crepe: hard and cold, not freshly made, lousy;Hot chocolate: not hot, super diluted, tasteless;Flat white: diluted, not enough milk or not fresh milk. Worse than Starbucks.Total cost: $43P.s. We asked for warm water, waitress even came back to confirm again and eventually we got 2 cups of ICE water.We will never come back again. "
French,Paul,This one for me is a no brainer... plain hype and fluff,10,3 September 2015,"1) Cramped2) Really awful service and incompetent staff3) Not worth paying that much for food; you're paying just for the location(One the other hand, I say the complete opposite of Paul in Dubai JBR location, that one was worth looking forward to a Sunday brunch!)"
French,Paul,Lunch,30,26 August 2015,"I had a late lunch alone at this resto. Not much people when i came as it was not a normal lunch time.I ordered the following1- lemongrass iced tea- almost flavorless. Lemongrass is smell present though. Not recommended - SgD7.52- chicken roulade- ok. not something that i will make me crave to come back - Sgd23.903. Creme brulee- this is my fav anywhere i go! Here is also average. Sgd-7.9Total paid- 46.26SgdService- average--- i needed to call a staff to order, and even to pay bill.Ambiance- okFor the quality of food served, it's too expensive!"
French,Paul,"Food is less than average, coffee is just milk",10,25 August 2015,"I came for lunch a few years back when it just opened amd the food and service were really good. So we decided to go again this time, unfortunately it was not the same anymore. We ordered the pie, salad and chicken leg. The pie was cold and dry amd tasteless, unlike any pie i've ever eaten that are warm and runny inside. The so called nicoise salad was very dissapointing, the tuna was so overcooked that it becomes so dry and again tasteless. The chicken leg was not that bad the first few bites, but once you ate the outer skin, the meat on the inside was again, tasteless. I ordered cappucino which only taste like nothing but milk, couldn't even taste a little bit of coffee in there. Did I mention the guy who serve us was either on the verge of dying or he completely hates his life? When we ask for water he sort of sigh and glare then slowly walk away. Too bad, i used to really like this place now its just like a fast food fancy restaurant, the food came out less than 10 mins after we ordered btw."
French,Paul,A Real Patisserie in Orchard Road,40,24 August 2015,"There are quite a few 'ordinary' places for afternoon tea in Orchard Road but Paul's looked better than most so we tried it, and were not disappointed. There a pleasant, upholstered armchairs, dark, polished wooden tables and, being a couple of floors up, there was a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere away from the bustle of the shopping centre. The patisseries and cakes taste as good as they look and are typical of some of those you might find in Paris or in a good German konditorei. The coffee is good, without being exceptional, but enjoyable nonetheless. Service was good, though not always as attentive as in other cafes. We will go back next time we want a pleasant break from Orchard Road."
French,Paul,A delicious French bakery/restaurant,40,3 August 2015,"Tanglin Mall, which has everything from clothing to toys to groceries, was close to the hotel in which my husband and I stayed on a recent trip. While in the mall, we had a wonderful lunch at Paul’s Bakery. I had salade carpaccio with zucchini and rocket salad (arugula) with balsamic glaze. Wonderful. My husband had Tourte Provençal - a tart of eggplant, zucchini, tomato and Parmesan sandwich, which he enjoyed. The French bread was as good as it gets. For dessert we split a Palmier (elephant ear), and each had a cappuccino, topped with a beautiful design made in the foam. The service wasn’t what we might have liked, but we thoroughly enjoyed the lunch, attractive to both the taste and the eye. A delicious bakery and restaurant that we recommend."
French,Paul,Paul Offers a Wide Choice of Food in Singapore the Service Disappoints,30,26 July 2015,"Paul is a well established restaurant. From France to China to Singapore you can find their outlets. The food is generally good and the seating area comfortable. All this is true in Singapore until the pleasure of the visit suffers problems with delivering the service. It is not intentional but it is noticeable. While this may have been a flat patch in their service at Tangling Mall and just been an off day, it did detract from the visit. Would we visit Paul restaurants again, very likely."
French,Paul,Pricey food,40,25 July 2015,"Food has quality and good but the service was lousy. My daughter and I were standing in the Q waiting to get a seat however the staffs walked past me seem do not bother to serve me. I have to walked inside and get someone who can find me a seat. To my surprise, there are few available seats outside the restaurant. The staffs are not friendly and helpful when I have a friend who joined me later. The waitress simply told me there is no empty chair available which is not true. There was no service standard."
French,Paul,Really 2.5 is more accurate.,30,20 July 2015,"Hmm, the food is good, the atmosphere is nice, even the ""outdoor"" seating, but the service and policies really bring it down, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.This a popular restaurant and the long queue waiting to get seated shows that, it also calls out for a better managed system, maybe a waiting list and SMS when there is an available table, something better. There is also a take away counter, like a traditional bakery with many tasty items calling out to be taken home. This take away counter presents another odd policy/system that should be better thought out. There are items at the take away counter that aren't on the menu, and you can't order them if you are dining in. This is such an odd decision, it is the same restaurant/kitchen the food is already prepared, sell the item for a dollar more and laugh all the way to the bank; yet they would not serve it. Speaking of serving items, our drinks arrived much after our food, and many follow up requests, even a freshly baked waffle came before Ice Lemon Tea. Even the second round of tea took so long to arrive, very disappointing."
French,Paul,Pricey food without quality!,10,17 July 2015,"Food: They gave me burnt wedges! the salads was normal, the sauce was normal, the food tasted almost like something from Fair Price or may be its from the BBQ section of Cold Storage. I ordered earl grey tea which taste like normal tea which doesn't have even a slight hint of citrus! Totally not worth the price! Service: The waitress doesn't really care to serve you even though there's no crowds."
French,Paul,Piece de Boeuf - a masterpiece!,40,14 July 2015,"At first I was only interested to try their pastries. But then when I saw people sitting to have lunch, then I decided to try their meals.One of the most recommended menus was ""Piece De Boeuf"" - Beef sirloin served with salad and fried potatoes and shallots.The taste was superb! I never tried anything like it. The steak was very soft and felt like melted in my mouth. It's a must try ;-) The price was not cheap but it's totally worth it."
French,Paul,Great sweets,40,11 July 2015,The macaron and the chocolate tart were good. Will definitely go back to try some of the other things next time!
French,Paul,The quality of food is average only,30,6 July 2015,"I happened to dine in this restaurant with my mom on Sunday July 5, as all the other restaurants in Takashimaya are fully booked. We had the mushroom soup, which was not too creamy, and not too fattening. However, the bread that came with it was really hard, that my mom nearly cracked her teeth with them. The garlic bread was also no better, as they used the same texture that made the bread. My mom and I shared a club sandwich. Seriously, they are a bit too bland and tasteless, that even the sandwich made by my maid at home is better than theirs. They are obviously short of staff too, as it takes them a while to clear our plates. May not go back again, as maybe their food is not to us the taste of the Asian people."
French,Paul,"Poor service, obviously shorthanded",30,30 June 2015,"I enjoyed my food at Paul, they are well known for their croissant. The fragrance is irresistible. However, they are very shorthanded. Their water is served after being reminded for 3 times. To take order, I have to ask for service twice as well as getting the bill.Would not go there during peak hour."
French,Paul,Cafe,30,28 June 2015,"Godo place where to ha e a break and take a cup of coffe. Available also pastries, salad and more. Service very care and very fast."
French,Paul,Afternoon Coffee 14th June. ,40,14 June 2015,"Had to wait for around 10 min for table which was ok because of the free wifi in Taka. Ordering was simple and fast and the food came quickly. The drinks took 5 min longer. I am impressed with the taste of the Nepolian not over sweet and the apricot tart was tart because if the fresh apricots. The pastry was crispy and thin. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant. Ambience ⭐️⭐️⭐️Menu Selection ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️Food Quality ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Portion Size ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Value for Money ⭐️⭐️⭐️Average Rating: 3.5  "
French,Paul,Lacking,10,7 June 2015,"Came to the Taka outlet for a Sunday brunch, and as Sunday brunches go, one simply would like a perfect meal on a warm sunny day to prime up for the melancholy Monday soon to come. Sadly, Paul requires more work in this aspect and is nowhere remotely close in offering a palatable experience. My girlfriend and I had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated, which, I must add, is absolutely normal for a fully packed cafe. However it is slightly discerning, and a tad bit infuriating, when one waits for 10 mins when there are empty tables within, as with the case today. But that's not a big deal cause it could have been worse and far longer than 10mins. So we finally gets seated and I ordered a beef tartine to satisfy my morning cannivorous urges while my gf gets her daily dose of good ol anti-oxidants in the form of a crepe champignon. After a decent wait, the waitress came with the crepe and a salmon tartine. With no inkling how beef could have sounded like salmon, I immediately informed her that my order is wrong. Instead of an apology, I got a dirty death stare in return. But she went to change the order nonetheless. So I waited and waited, until my gf is almost done with her food and my beef tartine was still nowhere in sight. I have to qualify that I do see a couple of beef tartines heading out of the kitchen, but were served to other tables whose patrons came after me. Isn't it typical common sense to serve it to the disgruntled customer whom you've gotten his order wrong first? Subsequently, after this arduous 20min wait, I decided to ask the waiter to check on my food. Albeit unlikely, perhaps my English was not clear and he brought the bill instead. Nice. And when I clarifed, he skipped to the kitchen to check and disappeared with no response on the status of my order.To sum up, my food did come after this tormenting wait and to be honest, it wasn't great - definitely not worth the wait nor worth the trouble nor worth having the excitement of a Sunday brunch desecrated. For all the gourmet food that Singapore offers, for better or for worse, Paul simply does not cut it."
French,Paul,Good food albeit slightly pricey,30,24 May 2015,"My colleagues and I went to the Paul branch in Takashimaya for a quick dinner. We ordered the tapas plates (beef, shrimp and avocado and chicken) and one pastry (hazelnut croissant if I'm not wrong). I found the shrimp and avocado tapas as well as the hazelnut croissant absolutely delicious! Service was mediocre though. May need to come back to try a heavier meal."
French,Paul,Relaxed,30,17 May 2015,I ate breakfast on Saturday. It was quiet and I could be relaxed. The taste is good. It might be difficult to find this shop.
French,Paul,"Good Food, Nasty Staff!",30,25 April 2015,"I gave it a ""3"" for the food was yummy though pricey. Old lady staff named ""BELLE or BELLA"" was just too nasty that we felt like we begged her to get a table. Good thing I was full of patience that time or else I might have walked away."
French,Paul,Beautiful cafe let down by sloppy service,20,19 April 2015,"The Paul's restaurant in Ngee Ann City, Orchard Road is set in a beautiful location. Set within Takashimaya department store, the restaurant has views looking onto Orchard Road or within the store itself. The standard Paul's menu has crepes, salads and other delicious meals. We have been here 4 times now for lunch or afternoon tea. While we enjoyed the food, each time we left feeling annoyed and disappointed with the service. Orders were half delivered, items were forgotten, we had to ask for milk for tea several times."
French,Paul,French Restaurant,40,8 April 2015,Visited Paul's for Lunch.Tuna Sandwich-Multigrain bread was excellent.The other dishes on the menu were mouthwatering but not being very hungry just had the above.They have varied choice for the not so hungry to the very hungry.
French,Paul,Disappointing,30,4 April 2015,"yes its a franchise, but goodness me it's dull. The food is not exciting, with no flare or attention paid to it. Paul is a popular chain in the UK and feels much better. This place was average"
French,Paul,Nice place but disappointed ,40,3 April 2015,"Great patisserie, we've been here many times both sit in and take away, but today we ordered a couple of simple sandwiches and soup. The soup was cold and the sandwich order incorrect - they took ages to fix it, nearly 30 mins despite our complaint. They could do with sharpening up their service to come in line with the premium prices they are charging before they will be deserving of an ""excellent"" rating."
French,Paul,Delectable but a bit high-priced,40,1 April 2015,"Food is delicious especially their dessert but the price is a bit on the high side. Good ambience, service is average as the waitress need us to remind her of our order."
French,Paul,"Good dishes, although portions could be bigger for the price we pay",30,24 March 2015,"We have been to several of their locations in SG and worldwide. In Singapore, their locations are nice, and the dishes quite varied and tasty. The only downside is that you pay the same price, if not more, for typical French items (croque-monsieur or crèpe complète for ex) as you do in a real French restaurant in Singapore. So since this is actually a bistro type of place, their prices should be cheaper."
French,Paul,They can do better,30,21 March 2015,Business lunch with the Boss. His tuna was overcooked which is a disaster if you a tuna eater. My cod fish was soft and juicy. Breads provided was good. Drinks ordered without ice came but it came with ice. Service was pleasant on this occasion. Overall was a good experience but the overcooked tuna does not help customers coming back. 
French,Paul,Paul first timer,30,8 March 2015,"I came to this lovely pastries shop last November. This place is really happening back in my hometown Jakarta, so as a pastry lover i should give it a try. I tried peach danish, chocolate mousse, lemon meringue tart and mango tart. So sorry but for me, tiong bahru bakery's pastries are better than paul's but maybe it's just me and my common palate :)"
French,Paul,Bad service,10,28 February 2015,Very bad service. Staff was rude and were inflexible in accommodating requests. Went at 2115. Half the tables inside was empty. But staff was unwilling to let us sit inside. It was a good hour before last orders. Very bad experience.
French,Paul,Letting the name of paul down with terrible service,10,14 February 2015,The kitchen just do not seem to understand that two people eating want to eat at the same time. Went here 6 weeks ago and my wife was served her food after I had finished mine. We tried again today and to make it simple we ordered the same simple meal. Hers arrived and I was assured mine was on the way. 15 mins later my wife had finished and mine still not arrived. I eventually got up and told the waitress to forget it as I was going to eat somewhere else. When she came with the bill it still had both meals on it. Will never eat here again and I think paul head office needs to sent someone quickly to sort this place out.
French,Paul,A Taste of France,40,10 February 2015,"We went to this place last night for our monthsary dinner. Surprisingly there was no queue because most of the time it's fully packed whenever I pass by. We had a table reservation and we got a table outside the resto. These are the dishes that we tried:Confit de Canard - this is a classic dish of the Perigord region of France. It's a slow roast herb marinated duck leg with roasted vegetables and cranberry sauce. The meat was so tender and complimented well with the cranberry sauce. This is a must-try at Paul.Saute' de poulet aux champignons - these are roasted chicken chunks in mushroom sauce with Paul's country bread. I like the mushroom sauce, it's so creamy. They give a generous serving of the bread too.Pistachio Macarons Frappe - this made from macarons blended with vanilla cream and milk. I actually tried this because I was curious on how it would turn out. It was good and you can feel the macarons as you take a sip. It's not bad but I just realized that macarons should just be eaten as itself and not as a drink. Tartelette Citron Meringueé - this is a lemon cream tartlet with soft meringue. I absolutely loved this! Usually I judge basing on how it looks like on the menu and It was my partner who actually ordered it. But when I tried it, it was divine. I ended up eating most of the portions. HahaPure Jee - its a chocolate mousse blob which is considered the darkest chocolate pastry at Pauls'. I'm not an avid fan of chocolates but it's still good. The chocolate mousse inside the blob is rich, thick and at time crunchy. I would say that I would definitely come back to eat here as there are still a lot of nice listings in their menu like the crepes, éclairs and tarts."
French,Paul,Good coffee and great desserts,40,5 February 2015,"Nice, quaint, European style cafe. I've tried Paul's Boulanger Patisserie in Bangkok and now Singapore. Good coffee and great, freshly baked bread and Pastries."
French,Paul,Expensive lunch,30,28 December 2014,Great looking place with a big queue. The whole concept seems based on keeping you waiting to maintain the queue. After fifteen minutes waiting we eventually got a table. The waited ten minutes to get served. The menu was good with a wide array of breads etc. the omelette I had was good and the salad excellent. They had ran out of small macaroons and the desert seemed to be missing components. Unless you like queuing to be with the incrowd best avoid! 
French,Paul,A piece of Paris in Tanglin,40,27 December 2014,Nice breakfast menu. The sides of salmon was well worth the price. Coffee was excellent. And of course pastries that are so delicious.
French,Paul,Great food and lovely cakes and tarts,40,21 December 2014,"I first experienced Paul in Paris many years ago and I was delighted when they opened in Singapore. I have been here many times, but in my most recent experience I felt that they had expanded the menu and improved the food. I had the Croque Monsieur for breakfast and I think it is one of the best Croque Monsieurs I have had in a long time. Their breads and cakes and tarts are always delicious. And their dinner menu seems to have a lot more choice than before. Good place for comfort food."
French,Paul,"Nice location, good food, slow service.",30,2 December 2014,"We enjoyed a nice lunch once it finally arrived. Paul's is nicely located for shoppers. Our experience was not stellar. We are ok with waiting for a table, but once seated, I really don't enjoy people having their order taken who arrived and sat down at least two groups behind us. The food was good, and their baguettes are excellent. I would try it again, but why when there are so many other great restaurants in Singapore."
French,Paul,Place with a view,30,30 November 2014,"When you need a coffee break during your shopping at Takashimaya you will find the coffee and cakes cheap because you just spent so much at this paradise of luxury. It's actullat not and the quality is average but the location runs the show. sit next to a window and watch the world go by and dont be angry about the steep prices, you are in a choice location where the rent is probably as high as in NY or London. "
French,Paul,When all you need is some good scrambled eggs . . .,50,29 October 2014,"As the title said, sometimes you just need to have some scrambled eggs on toast, Paul offers this every time, good service and excellent quality food. A simple choice of venue that always delivers."
French,Paul,Business Lunch,30,20 October 2014,Quite cramped although decor looks chic and the place is clean and new. The beef tartine served on bread was weak although the salmon baked in puff pastry was enjoyable. Nothing particularly outstanding though and pricey considering that.
French,Paul,Very crowded restaurant,40,17 October 2014,Served good pan cake however very crowded on weekend many peoples waiting for table staffs rushing to clear off the plate on the table while we are not done yet.
French,Paul,French Afternoon Delight...A Quaint French Bakery in the heart of Singapore,50,30 September 2014,"Was wondering where to have a quiet and interesting afternoon tea when we stumbled upon this French bakery. Fresh French breads, tarts, baquettes, macaroons & cakes...for a weekday afternoon, it's almost full house. Everyone seem to have something interesting on their table. Menu looks interesting with different salad, appetizers, sandwiches with your choice of bread, croissants. It was hard to choose as everything looked interesting. We settled for an afternoon tea set that comprises of a cappuccino/latte, 2 mini macaroons (lemon & caramel), a mini creme brûlée & a chocolate cake. This set costs a decent $12. I wanted a scrumptious looking lemon raspberry sponge cake (Moelleux citron framboise-$7.40), however it was sold out. French jazz was played in the background with crystal chandelier on the ceiling..we had a corner table that overlooks the busy Orchard road..Overall, it was a great time spent with a scrumptious afternoon tea."
French,Paul,Not even close to any Paul in France,20,8 September 2014,"Forget the real Paul in France. Since here you'll find only the same name on the door, nothing else.Pricey place inside the famous Takashimaya shopping mall. Service quite rude, no smiles at all and food not well presented, especially when you pay 9 SGD for a slice of cake you don't expect a broken piece thrown on a plate. When you pay 17 SGD for ONE coffee and ONE slice of cake you'd like something more.Wasted money."
French,Paul,Almost perfect,40,29 August 2014,Delicious food and good tasting coffee. We had sandwiches and a croque Monsieur. Everything was very well prepared and tasted delicious. The sandwiches were baguettes and came -as the croque Monsieur - together with a side salad. Overall good value for money and authentic French taste!Could not give 5 stars since no wifi available there (strange for a café in the midst of Takashimaya-Mall)
French,Paul,Best pastries in Singapore,40,26 August 2014,Went there for breakfast. They simply have the best pastries in town. The breakfast is actually a good deal by Singapore standards.Zero atmosphere specially if you're sitting outside. It is in a huge shopping centre where the shops open at 10:00. Paul opens at 09:30.
French,Paul,Paul - worth a second shot,40,30 July 2014,"It was my second visit here, this time for lunch with a couple of lady friends.I started with a Tartine Saumon (SGD$19.90) - smoked salmon, avocado, leek , mixed herbs and cheese. The smoked salmon was succulent and not too salty, and I love the combination of this cold, slimy delicacy wrapped around buttery avocado, nestling atop crispy slices of toast. It was a healthy but satisfactory concoction of all my favorite things, done in flavors that danced across the tongue.*Chantal had the Omelette Complete (SGD$14.90) - omelette with slices of grilled turkey ham, mushrooms and cheese served with salad, Provencal tomatoes and potatoes. It was a flavorful piece of culinary art, with the eggs beaten well and taste was well-accorded with a nice balance of the fillings within the protein-rich omelette.I had the Raspberry Tart (SGD$7.90) - Tartlette Framboises - classic fruit tartlet made with a crispy, buttery pastry crust, filled with creme patissiere and topped with raspberries. Contrary to its glossy, syrupy-looking photos, the real tart came with raspberries powdered with sugar / icing instead, giving the sour fruits a sweet guise. The pastry crust was delicious though, and the creme fillings was silky smooth with a light, lovely flavor.*Chantal had the Millefeuille Fraises - crispy golden puff pastry, strawberry creme-filled Napoleon cake topped with light apricot glaze. The combination of textures - crispiness, soft creamy sweetness and juicy bits of real strawberries embedded within this pretty pastry was a sinful necessity in itself - lovely!For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/lunch-at-pauls-bakery-restaurant-cafe.html"
French,Paul,dessert heaven,40,24 July 2014,"*THIS IS FOR THE WESTGATE OUTLETlocation - westgate mall @ Jurongpremise - quiet and nice. very good for dates, coffee get together n just plain relaxing on your ownstaff - good and polite greeting and prompt servicefood - we didnt try the mains as they looked quite basic to us but the desserts? heavenly. they all were good and made very well!!verdict - good place to go for desserts and here @ WESTGATE, there was no crowd so it was easy to get the seats on a weekday evening (645pm)"
French,Paul,Good food. Average service. ,40,12 July 2014,"But good ambience. Nice location for shoppers or business people. During peak hours be prepared to queue. Queue will move slowly as food does not come out of Kitchen quick enough and service is slow. Once they even forgot our order. But when the food did arrive. It was like wow. Great cod. My boss eats elegant foods and he enjoyed it. I've been here about 5times in 2 yrs and enjoyed the food every time. I also learned that in restaurant service in general is average and I do not expect too much. This way you can still enjoy your visit, the food and just nudge your server to do a good job. I will visit Paul's at Ngee Ann City soon. "
French,Paul,OK Price for Orchard - Nice Food - Always Busy,40,10 July 2014,"Place is always busy however they always manage to find a spot for you.I attended with three work colleagues for a quick lunch and was light and easy, Prices are what you would expected for Orchard around Takashimaiya so if you don't want to pay S$ 20+ for lunch then head back to ION Food Court."
French,Paul,Tanglin mall restaurant.,40,7 July 2014,"Excellent service. Great food. An authentic atmosphere and menu. Particularly impressed with real bread after days of steamed ""toast"". Will look out for their other sites"
French,Paul,Good atmosphere and food. ,50,29 June 2014,"Paul in Ngee Ann City is a comfortable space to put up your feet, sit back and relax. I had the fish meal which was delicious and the raspberry and creme éclair for dessert. Yum. Main was $27.00 so two courses around $50. My only feedback was that they were so busy that service was lacking and we had to constantly call staff over. The staff were friendly though. "
French,Paul,Not to recommend,10,20 June 2014,I was extremely disappointed that the food menu distributed on Every table as a set was only available as of a certain hour and I was told that I have to wait 20min until I could order it. Very strict timing; not really French.
French,Paul,Staff more concern with her personal agenda,20,20 June 2014,"Visited the outlet at Takashimaya on the 18th June 2014 together with my wife and I, we were attended to a somewhat distracted hostess, no smile, not a care in the world. I politely told her that we would prefer to sit outside as I felt we were slightly under-dressed for the inside of the restaurant.The hostess, with funky hair highlights of her fringe walked to the end of the restaurant, placed the menu on the table and just left. Ok, maybe because we look like a couple of 'can't afford kinda people'. Realistically, I don't care about that. What really irks me was the fact that that hostess was moaning to I guess would be her supervisor about how she was not granted her leave of absence to go for her holiday.All my wife and I wanted was a peaceful meal and we can't help but to merely eat and 'watch' our comic relief. My advise to the supervisor and the moaning hostess, please take your personal issues away from your PAYING customers, you are an international restaurant, not a void deck coffeeshop. On a side note, the tomato soup was good. We basically ate our dinner, paid and got out of there. This was my very first time to Paul @ Taka, probably also my last."
French,Paul,Pauls (Tanglin Mall),10,19 June 2014,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. We had lunch and it was over-priced, the food was very so so, and a the waiter was so rude (from start to finish). They had a basket of bread on the table and we ate a few pieces. I ask for a bag to take the leftover bread home. The waiter rudely told me no this is not possible as it is free while you are in the restaurant only. So we ask - so you reuse this bread and he replied no we throw it away. I don't believe a restaurant would be so wasteful. I think they reuse the bread in the basket which is absolutely disgusting. I will not eat there again and do not recommend it."
French,Paul,Bad service! Paul @Takashimaya,10,5 June 2014,"my friend and I went to this place mainly to find a place to feed our babies. One of the lady staff prepared a sitting place for us to include 2 prams which was much appreciated. But another guy staff asked me to ONLY take 1 pram and leave one outside.Obviously, we're not happy because our babies need to sleep inside the pram after feeding.my friend and I insisted that we really need the two prams to be in.Well, If it's too limited space to bring in the pram, he can actually ask us to wait for another sitting area instead of give that bad suggestions. *which I can see there's other tables already cleared.We almost want to leave but then we choose to stay because the lady helps me push the other pram in while my friend can start to feed her baby first. Good service from the lady staff.We ordered ice latte and the taste just average and the chocolate cake taste alright but not delicious. Given a choice, we wouldn't want to choose this restaurant anymore."
French,Paul,"Yummy Bread, but service a bit slow",40,29 May 2014,"I have been to Paul (Takashimaya Shopping Centre)twice in the last 3 months, and I have not been dissappointed by the food, nor the yummy bread which I always love. It is a little expensive but worth getting away from the norm in Singapore. Try the Mango salad, before you finish the free side serving of bread. Avoid peak hour like over lunch time unless you want to stand in a line. A little ahead of lunch time say 1145 is better. only negative is the service which can be a little slow, like we had to ask for water, the bill, food took awhile to be served but the wait is worth it. oh and yes take some bread home from the baker!"
French,Paul,could be so good but staff are poor,20,24 May 2014,"Having been to Paul in the UK and France i was expecting more from the Paul in Singapore. The food is as you would expect, French and expensive but more boring than in Europe. The selections are often lacking in imagination but the contents are mostly delicious especially the desserts.The refusal to service the full menu before 11.30 is just annoying and the staff are not at all accommodating or service orientated. The breakfast menu is sparse and they refused to serve separate bread to my partner even though being vegetarian she had limited options and despite their being bread served with other non-vegetarian foods.Not impressed."
French,Paul,pretty packed!,30,28 April 2014,"Paul is huge in Western Europe as far as I reckon. When I knew they open several chains in Asia, I was a bit skeptical. But hey I got it wrong. This Paul store in Singapore is the next big thing. So packed during brunch-dinner. Loving their Caesar salad and their bread of course. Bravo, Paul! :D"
French,Paul,Breakfast ,20,26 April 2014,"came for a quiet Saturday breakfast. Place is okay. Not wonderful experience. First the waiter said that we could only Sit in passage because the management is saving electricity by not running the AC. when we asked door a plug point, we were told that they have no plug points. When asked if there was internet, there is none. It just felt like a breakfast full of excuses. The only good thing from this place is the view."
French,Paul,Cold coffee and weak tea,10,1 April 2014,Lousy weak tea from a tea bag and cappuccino was cold. Tat and pastry was good though. Request to change the tea was denied. I felt this was denied
French,Paul,"Grand European cafe style, great for a light lunch",40,27 March 2014,"This is a nice grand cafe style restaurant which is quite different to the Paul style in Europe. The location is impeccable and the restaurant nicely decorated, light and airy. There were many staff and service was prompt if a little curt. The food was as expected, simple, fresh and nicely served. As always the bread and pastries are a particular strength of Paul and this Singapore incarnation is no exception. Great for a simple lunch in above average surroundings. Quite pricy but not much above the norm for this quarter of Singapore's shopping district."
French,Paul,"Good food, lousy service",30,21 March 2014,The food at the cafe is good. The bakery is outstanding. The coffee is not good. The service is not good.
French,Paul,Pastry dessert not as tasty but Steak was good,30,19 March 2014,"Went with colleagues last evening for dinner at Paul's Takashimaya (Halal restaurant, went with muslim colleagues). Service staff seemed untrained and didn't have the proper knowledge to make recommendations. Drinks was pricey at $7.50 for Lemon iced tea (just a slice of lemon and has a bitter taste). Desserts we had was a strawberry tart (not as good as we thought) and chocolate part (texture was very dry)We ordered a main course Steak medium well for me that was the only saving grace for this restaurant, pretty good tender steak that I would recommend. For the price we paid, I think we were only paying for the parisian decor."
French,Paul,"so so food, poor service",20,12 March 2014,"Went to Paul at Trader’s twice lately because one of my son was not with us in the 1st visit and wanted to try. Both times the bread was way too hard. Another thing that disappointed me was the restaurant’s apparent habit of dumping a basket of bread without offering plates or butter. It happened in my 1st visit and in my 2nd visit, I had to ask the Chinese waiter twice after waiting 10 minutes before he nonchalantly gave us plates to eat our bread; that was before our main course. I don’t know if its customary in French restaurants of this range, but it would take very little effort for the staff to ask guests if they wanted butter or plates (if one has to ask for plates in the first place) rather than dump the bread and disappear. Such dampener at the beginning spoil the mood for the whole meal and I wonder how the restaruant earnerd some of those praises"
French,Paul,Mediocre pastry and service,30,9 March 2014,"Having heard raves and good reviews about Paul's Bakery and always seeing the long queues, we were eager to try it, thinking that it must have been very impressive. However, our first experience left us with much to be desired.After a tough mental battle between Hot Chocolate and Tea Gourmand, I decided on the latter, which came with three pieces of Macorons as well. While I sipped my hot tea, I nibbled on the a-tad-too-sweet macarons, glad to be able to swallow the saccharine tiny cookie-like pastries easier.No worries there, the tea and macarons were not the highlight anyway. We patiently awaited our tarts to be served.I had the Chocolate Tartlette- a small name for a rather good-sized pastry. The crust was solid and not crumbly like how some tarts fall apart the moment it is put to the fork's test. The chocolate was .... nondescript? There was no rich strong aroma of good chocolate or the bittersweet-ness of my favorite dark chocolate; the taste was pleasant, but nothing that blew me away. It was a rather normal chocolate tart, in my humble opinion.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/tea-at-pauls-bakery.html"
French,Paul,People Queue for This?!,30,4 March 2014,"Very expensive food that makes you feel that you're paying in Euro. Elbow to elbow seating, ala Parisian cafes. People Queue for This?! Maybe the fengshui of this place is really good."
French,Paul,"Really Bad Service (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",10,3 February 2014,"Couldn't find where to write specifically for the Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall. For those who do not know, Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall is the latest branch. The Paul Bakery at Westgate mall is yet another cafe who has such bad service until I simply cannot tolerate. As someone who has written and edited many customer service guidebooks as well as an easy-going person in general, never in my life did I expect to be CHASED out of a cafe/restaurant as soon as I tried to sit down. Let me explain what happened. My friend and I decided to have our lunch at this Paul Bakery today. We saw the queue sign outside the high class bakery and we were wondering if we should even queue since there isn't ANYONE queuing. We waited for a while before deciding to just walk in since no one came to attend to us and also because we saw quite a good number of empty seats. So we very happily walk in thinking what a nice place it is, with all the beautiful French decor. Note that no one even bothered attending to us. So we thought it's pretty straightforward that we can just choose our seats FREELY (which person wouldn't do that you tell me? It doesn't matter that no one bothered to attend to us since they probably are busy. Although i don't see how busy the staff were) . So we chose an empty table for 4 and I sat down. Then this waitress came up to us and said loudly, ""miss, that table is for four persons, you cannot sit there. You must sit at the 2 person table."" I immediately thought to myself, ""You never even attend to me and ask me how many pax do we actually have and you tell me I cannot sit so loudly. The 4 pax table is made up of 2 small tables and can definitely be SEPARATED if NEEDED."" So I said, the extra table can be separated if needed. Now, there were only 2 other 2-pax tables in the whole cafe. One at the entrance but the table was damn small (okay, we wanted to order more food. So they expect us to sit at a freaking small table just because there were only 2 of us? Honestly, if we are going to order a lot of food, we should just choose a bigger table which can contain all our food items isn't it? This is really common sense. If I am just ordering a COFFEE, fine, I squeeze. I think I AM FAIR in this aspect). And so, I spotted a nice looking spot which has a better table at one of the corners and requested for it but the table was not cleaned yet as the previous patrons just left. Guess what, the honorable waitress actually told me ""that table cannot sit because we need to clear the table first. You have to GO OUTSIDE and QUEUE."" I asked my friend if I heard wrongly or did that waitress really ask me to get up from my seat and go out of the door and queue? Yes, I have to open the freaking big door and go stand outside. Everyone in the cafe suddenly just turned and looked at us. Please note that we still did not make any unreasonable request or became unreasonable. The only thought was unbelief with the sucky attitude. They could have first come up to us and ask us how many pax do we have, is it only 2 persons, if so, is it possible that we choose a 2 pax table instead so they could offer the table to customers who are in 4s if they happen to come in. As a high class cafe, they should expect that patrons may walk in anytime to reserve a table while waiting for other friends. You cannot deny this is a common culture in Singapore and probably anywhere else in the world. They could have ask us to take a seat first while they clear the table since there really isn't a queue. We have already obliged by relocating to a 2 pax table. So we were asked to GO OUTSIDE and stand. Not wanting to make a fuss, we simply went out to stand under the scrutiny of the whole cafe. I must say that was a ""very nice"" send-off by so many people. Meanwhile, there was a Caucasian lady who stepped into the restaurant at the same time. She was also not allowed to sit. I don't know what was the reason but she was obviously astonished with the attitude as she walked out and the three of us actually look at the cafe with a ""what is wrong"" glance and we decided to walk away at the same time. We actually met the same Caucasian lady at the next cafe. My point is, I am pissed not because I can't have lunch there. I am just damn pissed that I am getting such a bad attitude and service when I actually obliged. I don't mind obliging to your request to queue OUTSIDE if you have told me politely that you would like us to queue outside while you get the table ready and that you will come get me once the table is ready. At least, you can definitely just allow me to SIT at the empty tables or hand me the menus first. But I mind it freaking A LOT when you tell me to go outside and stand and that I can't sit at any empty table. You are a high class French cafe with very good branding. But you have very bad (probably non exist) f & b service management. Instead of keeping your customers and making them feel welcomed, you actually turn away not one but 3 customers who are willing to eat at your cafe!"
French,Paul,Not French Cuisine,20,22 January 2014,"We visited the restaurant in Ngee Ann City in Singapore last night. All we wanted was a quick dinner so we thought we would give the outlet a try. We were here 2/3 years ago when it opened and walked out due to the total lack of service. Tonight the greeting was quicker and more professional. I ordered the beef steak. It had almost no flavour and very little to commend it all. The gravy tasted as if it was an instant gravy mix and had just been mixed with water and poured over. The saute potatoes were soft and soggy. The speed with which the meal arrived should have set some warning bells ringing. I sense the possible use of a microwave.My partner went for seafood meal which consisted of 2 mussels and 2 prawns in a bechamel sauce. He tells me it tasted of wallpaper paste, but I am not sure how he knows this.To drink we had Orangina which I imagine it would be difficult to mess up. The total bill was SGD77 which was very much overpriced for the food we received.I noticed at a nearby table that the main course of the diners meal arrived before they had finished their starter. The restaurant needs to do something about timing. Most of the staff looked totally bored and they didn't seem as though they wanted to be there. I know how they feel!!!If you find yourself in Singapore this is one eatery to give a miss. However, to establish some balance I have to tell you that the breads and pastries in the takeaway shop looked excellent. It may be case of a touch of diversity in the products on offer going a step too far."
French,Paul,Not that different,30,19 January 2014,"I went there for a brunch. The service was nice but everything was cold. I asked the waiter if there products is Halal and he said everything is Halal but after that there is people say it is not, I hope they do not lie about these things."
French,Paul,"Paul, at the moment, is NOT HALAL",30,3 January 2014,"In ""reply"" to Anneayesha's review, at the moment, 3rd January 2014, Paul is NON-HALAL French bakery. If you need further clarification, please check the MUIS website or their twitter account: @halalSG. Thank you."
French,Paul,Great start of the day,50,31 December 2013,"Just went to the Tanglin mall outlet for breakfast and it was excellent. Great service, great food, good coffee, good atmosphere good prices. Would come again."
French,Paul,French bakery,40,27 December 2013,"Paul, is a French bakery and restaurant chain that was first set up in Croix in 1889. They now have many branches all over the world. I have been to some in the Middle East. They now have 5 branches in Singapore.Some of their food is quite nice, their desserts nice but look better and their bread very nice. If you're in the mood for a nice evening with a bottle of wine and some runny or smell delicious French cheese, get the bread from Paul. Their bread is ideal for eating with soft French cheese."
French,Paul,Nice place to chill,50,17 December 2013,Chose this cafe for breakfast meeting and we love the breakfast selwction. The menu has quite a wide choice and price is reasonable. Service staff is attentive and great too. Will definitely be back
French,Paul,Good place for lesisurely for tea and pastries,50,16 December 2013,We used to go for tea at Kinokuniya Coffee Club. This is an excellent find very near the bookstore with good ambience. Get a window seating. Enjoyed the pastries and macarons
French,Paul,Not bad at all....,40,30 November 2013,"Can get crowded at times. Comfortable seatings though. Staffs can be a bit slow and inattentive sometimes, maybe due to so many patrons. The food, excellent. Really enjoyed our lunch there."
French,Paul,Halal French Restaurant: Just Average,30,27 November 2013,"Nice decor however not as competent as other french restaurants i have been to. Service was pretty bad as waitress was not very polite in getting orders as well as not prompt in service. The food was nothing extraordinary. We had beef steak ($28.90) and seafood gratin( $24.90) and salmon croissant ($17.90). The seafood gratin is too cheesy. The bitter-ness from the emmanuel cheese does not help in making it taste better at all. The salad which comes with it taste so much better. However, the beef steak (can't rmmbr the actual name) was good. Sauce and dressing complements the meat well. The deserts were good (ordered the crepe -$7.90, the strawberry tart - $6.90, and the chocolate eclair - $6), the french baguette was tasty, soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Bill totalled to about $130 inclusive of GST."
French,Paul,An excellent find,50,18 November 2013,"Good food, nice décor, above average service by Singapore standards.
Large portion sizes, (the salmon salad contained a large portion of salmon)
The lemon meringue pie was amazing, possibly the best I’ve ever had.
I nice venue for afternoon tea"
French,Paul,French illusions,20,21 October 2013,"To be fair the pastries to go are good. However the restaurant food is poor and the price expensive. As others have said it is just not French food. We had the steak. It was the antithesis of a French steak. It was tough, skinny and stuck in the mouth. The accompanying potato was over cooked and did not seem freshly made. The deserts were varied. The creme brûlée was ok but burnt on top. The crepe with sugar was terrible. It was cold and pasted to the plate. i could not scrape most of it off. The chocolate waffle was the winner for the day no complaints there.The service was fair. The staff were pleasant and helpful once you got their attention. Little things such as refilling water could have been better but I have had much worse. The decor and setting is good and it is a shame that the standard of food does not match the ambience and price. Stick to the takeaway pastries."
French,Paul,Bad French Atmosphere,10,4 October 2013,"I visited Paul@Ngee Ann City on two occasions, the last visit was a few months ago.This outlet has NO ATMOSPHERE on both occasions that I visited. The staff are mostly local Malays and Chinese. There is a complete absence of any French atmosphere. Cooking is uninspiring.Serving is haphazard.Service is poor.With the small portions, it makes for extremely poor value overall."
French,Paul,Best raspberry tarts in my life,40,3 October 2013,"Coffee, tea, hot chocolate so so. Really love their raspberry tarts, sweet and a bit sour fruit, big raspberry too. Think tiong bahru bakery has something similar but raspberry smaller andmore expensive. Paul is a nice place to go for afternoon teas. I think the croissant ($1.80 exclude gst and taxes) is nice when they heat up for dine in. It's certainly worth when they served you cheese butter and yummy jams with the croissant. But the better one ($2.50) is at the bakery shop right inside taka basement besides cold storage. The one just at the entrance of basement is $1.30 when you heat it up just like any nice croissant. Paul's sesame bread they gave free for group dine in is only $2.50. Where to get such superb quality at this price at bread talk. Paul only accept walk in. Happy queueing."
French,Paul,Very average.....,20,18 September 2013,And the price is high.....not French food by any standard .....we went for lunch and and we're very disappointed .....my husband ordered cod fish which came with a little salad without ant dressing and steep at S$ 27......I had a Provençal tartain ....which was served on soggy bread....not a what i expected........very little cheese ....shavings of outer peels of vegetables ....very average.....
French,Paul,Late Tea at Paul,30,10 September 2013,"It was like 5pm+ and we passed by here. I was attracted by Paul's beautiful cakes and pastries. We decided to have a cup of tea and few pieces of cakes here! The environment was great, very comfy and relaxing. I liked the raspberries tart we ordered. Freshly touch but not too sweet. C'est bon! Paul is def. one of the good places for afternoon tea and cake in Orchard areaCheersD"
French,Paul,Opens for breakfast yet no typical breakfast items available!,30,17 August 2013,"Paul a French patisserie opens for breakfast at 9am (different to whats advertised) and has an extensive section in their menu of different drinks with a breakfast item. This item includes a croissant or a pain de chocolate, typical for a French breakfast and what's on offer at Paul's. Yet it's not ready and this isn't the first time it - happens consistently that these items as stated on their menu are not ready. The staff then offer you to go to the counter to choose something else all more of the cake variety, morning or afternoon tea or sandwiches. For a European like myself I come here to have a European breakfast after all that's what they are selling, so don't bother - go somewhere else, as it wasn't just me complaining the table next to me too (a French native) as well, therefore this must be consistent service down falls. The staff just look and apologise not sure what they are trying to achieve with this! At 930 I asked again if they are ready, was told another 15 minutes! So apart from breakfast, their breads and pastries are nice, fresh and in season. "
French,Paul,Fantastic food!,50,9 August 2013,I enjoy every bite and every sip of every menu I ordered. Great food and coffee. I will definitely be a regular customer.
French,Paul,Mediocre food and service,20,2 August 2013,"The cafe au liat has no coffee taste - i compare it to the 2 other cafes in the same building - this is of poor quality. The blueberry tart was ok - nothing fantastic. While i was there some other customer, who were there before me, got irritated at not receiving one order of food, which seemed to be just an order of toast. My order was served earlier than theirs. Since there are 2 other cafes there, i would not step into this one again"
French,Paul,huge disappointment,10,29 July 2013,"Over the past years we ate breakfast at Paul Dubai regularly. Furthermore, we had good experience at Paul outlets in France.We must agree with most of the points raised from those who reviewed Paul. Customers who have patronised Paul certainly know what to expect. The cafe decor and sitting are impressive. However, the food and service need serious improvement.Coffee was normal but came only half cup full. Most of the menu dishes are served with toast bread rather than something ""french"". Omelette, mushroom came cold and looked pathetically cheap. Most of all, you had to ask for butter and jam! And they ran out of strawberry jam, which is the hallmark of Paul.If they want customer to return, they have to put their act together and bring back the real Paul's quality and image."
French,Paul,"Take away, don't waste money dining in",30,20 July 2013,"We have heard from friends and colleagues how great Paul is...the real french bakery in SIngapore, a must visit!First experience was with takeaway - perfect. Real good bread, amazing pastries, nothing to complain about, just great and we will be back again and again.Today we decided to go there for breakfast. Please, if you think about doing the same, don't bother. It really is not worth the trouble and the money you leave there.The line outside was not too bad, we only waited about 10 min. Service was fine, neither good, nor bad, quick and to the point.The worst thing is the actual food. Not what you expect from a French bakery with their prices. They make great breads and pastries, so I just cannot understand why they must serve such mediocre food. Croque monsieur for $17 with cheap turkey ham and tasteless cheese and few sad salad leaves? Salad was actually the best thing on the plate. A very big disappointment. Coffee was another disappointment. Honestly, you will have a much better breakfast at Toast Box with great coffee for a good price.We are sticking to takeaway at Paul, pastries are the best we have found in Singapore so far."
French,Paul,Atrocious service...,10,16 July 2013,Been here several time.. Always have a problem with service but never as bad as today when I have to walk off. I don't know whether if it's because I have 2 kids in tow that they don't take me seriously or I am not dressed to the nines like the other customers. Sat there like an idiot waiting for a staff to take my orders but they seem to conveniently ignored me and took everyone's order who came after me. Decided to leave because no matter how much waving got me no attention... 
French,Paul,Nice lunch at Paul,40,3 July 2013,"Not sure why I found so many bad reviews here. Because for me personally, the food are quite good. Yes, the coffees are weak but the bread selections from their bakery are really nice. A bit pricey for a light meal, expect to spend around S$30-35 for a meal and drink. Avoid long queues by coming early for lunch or dinner."
French,Paul,Worth a visit if you are looking for lunch in the Orchard Road area,50,28 May 2013,"Really good food, good service and very friendly staff who really looked after us. Tables a bit close together but not enough to spoil your meal."
French,Paul,Not Impressive,20,20 May 2013,"Price paid not worth for the service & food rendered. Servers not attentive, food took way too long to arrive even when the restaurant is not packed. $8 for a small cup of orange juice? But we all agreed that the best dish had to be the beef tartine :) "
French,Paul,Go for take-away,20,7 April 2013,"""Fresh"" orange juice diluted with water, a tiny tiny jam pot when you take a basket of bread to share, scruffy waiters that do not pay attention to you and 1:40 min to get served. Where are your French standards Paul?! This is the typical example of a low-cost, low-class excellent value-for-money shop that tries to export a luxury ""look"" just because they are French. You clearly failed! You are better off sticking to what you do best, Paul: nice, tasty boulangerie. Quit trying to copy your brother LaDuree, you have not gotten the same name and experience!Positives: Cooked-from-frozen croissants don't taste that bad..."
French,Paul,Poor service and attitude,10,2 April 2013,"Had afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon... long wait for a table.Ordered tea... Tea came in a teapot which had too much water for 1 teabag. Found that out when I poured my tea, it was like dishwater .And water was not hot enough. When asked for a another teabag was told had to pay for it. I pointed out that they had put too much water in the pot for one bag and that is why I wanted another bag, we asked to speak to the manager, waiter walked away, eventually we flagged down the waiter that took our order and spoke to him about the problem with the tea, I asked for a replacement pot with a lot less water, which he obliged he then proceeded to tell me not to put so much milk in my tea!!! I usually visit Paul when in Singapore, on my previous visits the service has been good but this time will be the last time. But does it matter to them...I doubt it.. judging by the line waiting to go in and the attitude of the staff."
French,Paul,Paul's @ Nee Ann City,30,1 April 2013,French Patisserie with lousy coffee - again - my beef with restaurants using UHT milk - what's up with that? Puhlease...I know in France I would get proper quality milk with my Café Au Lait...and why not with quality French pastries and brunch? I'm not going back until they do something about the coffee - oh - and the service.
French,Paul,Excellent Meal,40,30 March 2013,"Had a really good breakfast at Paul's. Salmon, with turkey ham and eggs were were really great. It can be considered pretty pricey as they charge $8.80 for freshly squeezed orange juice, but the ambience is pretty good. Its a must try for me. :)"
French,Paul,Ticked off the 'to do list',30,18 March 2013,"My husband and I went to Paul for a Saturday breakfast. I had been planning on going for months after salivating at the wonderful array of pattisseries in the take away section. We had an egg, turkey ham, tomato and 'soft' bread plate. The food tasted fine, but it was nothing special. Price was OK at just under $10 for the meal. I had a cappucino which was very good. The carrot and ginger juice ( a bit pricey at $8) was nice. The service was fine - prompt and obliged us moving tables - but this was before the obligatory queues mid morning. The front area is very a bit cramped - not sure what you have to do to get an inside table. The pastries looked wonderful and I wish I had chosen the croissant and coffee."
French,Paul,Worst meal I have had in Singapore,10,15 March 2013,"Our experience was so poor, I am not sure where to start. Surly, disorganized staff - dirty cutlery - ridiculous wait for a server to bring menus and to place an order. As if that was not bad enough, the overflowing garbage can was too much until one of the staff sorting clean cutlery stopped what he was doing and proceeded to pick up garbage from the overflowing can and push it down before returning to sort more 'clean' cutlery. Needless to say, we had seen enough, got our check and left....never to return. The positive thing about Paul I can think of is its location on Orchard Road."
French,Paul,"Nice food, poor service",20,3 March 2013,"We went to Paul to have a quick dinner recently. The food was good and it was served quickly although the selection wasn't quite as large as in Paris for example.However, the whole experience was let down by the poor service that we received. We arrived there close to 9 PM and the restaurant wasn't busy. We stood in front of the restaurant and waited for a wait staff to find us a table. There was a group of staff that was just standing around and gossiping and one of them (a short, Chinese auntie-looking staff) saw us but just ignored us and continued to gossip with her colleagues. Another wait staff (a Chinese guy) also saw us but also ignored us and continued to sashay past us. We must have waited for close to 5 mins before a Malay waitress greeted us and showed us to a table. We were also ignored again during the short time we were in the restaurant.I understand that this is Singapore, where service is horrible and basically non-existent. But somehow I thought it would be different given the type of establishment this is. Clearly I was wrong. We won't be back, I don't think the food is phenomenal enough to make up for the poor service that we received."
French,Paul,PAUL - French Bakery Restaurant (Le Restaurant Du Boulanger),50,25 February 2013,The service was fantastic as was the food. Holy wow on the food here. If you can't make a trip to Paris at least you can cure a craving at Paul in Singapore.
French,Paul,Absolutely terrible and not worth it,10,18 February 2013,"I visited Paul on a Sunday close to lunch time. There wasn't a line when we got there but it was relatively crowded. We got a table immediately. Then it all went downhill. We ordered water, and my glass had a smell. I asked to change it and the waitress brought another glass back and put it on one corner of the table, further away from me, when she knew it was my glass that had the smell. We ordered one Boeuf Tartine and one Crepe Complet. We had to wait for a while for the food. But when it did come, it was not hot, not even warm. It also didn't taste good. Dessert was waffle, which we shared. Again, it took a while to arrive and we had to chase for it. When it did come, it wasn't hot as well! if it took a while to come surely it must mean that it was just cooked and should be hot? It also tasted rather stale. Service staff, while not rude, hardly said anything, and merely gestured. They were however surprisingly friendly and chatty to one table away from us, probably a regular customer. All in, a really disappointing experience and I would not go back again. Neither would I recommend anyone to go there to eat. I've tried their cakes and pastries before, and they are decent. Perhaps visit if you only want cakes, but not for a meal."
French,Paul,Yummy French Pastries,40,4 January 2013,"If you are craving for French pastries plus a coffee, then Paul is your place. It is not cheap but the quality is very good and the service is fine. We didn't have to wait at all."
French,Paul,Overhyped,30,31 December 2012,"We were in Takashimaya and we decided to try Paul. First, the queue to get a seat was long. A combination of reasons we guessed - lots of first timer diners trying out, diners were taking a long time to decide and service was slow. Yes, service was a let down. That was a combination of factors too - possible new waiters/waitresses, cramp seating space and the kitchen can't get the orders out at the same time.The food was nothing to shout about. I believe there are other pastry eateries/bakeries with equal or better baquettes, macaroons, lemon tarts and crepes and without a famous name and/of a popular location like Paul.If you have lots of time (as mentioned the queue is long), a couple (if your group is more than a couple, your wait will be longer) and no place to go in Takashimaya, then Paul could be your place. The service may continue to be poor. After all, as long as the queue is long getting in, Paul is still happy."
French,Paul,Eat here if you shop at Takishamaya,50,1 December 2012,"This cafe has a nice view from the windows overlooking Orchard Road and has very comfortable furniture and pleasant decore. It is always busy and we've had to line up on occasions but it is worth it.The food is French cafe influenced with crepes. beautiful crisp bread and pastries, but also has beautiful salads with lovely fresh and healthy ingredients.You can get freshly squeezed juices or iced tea to go with your delicious salad or just go for the decadent tarts and desserts with a well made coffee. There is an excellent book shop next door if you're after something to read on your plane trip, as well as a money changer. The cafe is on the 3rd or 4th floor from memory and you can enter from the middle tower on Orchard Road."
French,Paul,Tom O,50,19 November 2012,"While walking through the Takayeshama shopping center we thought we would look for a restaurant to eat lunch. Remembering what Anthony Bordaine said on his travel food show that usually where there is a long line, the food will probably be good we started looking for the long lines. At the same time, I was looking for a money exchange place and on the 2nd floor, I found the money exhangeer and a long line waiting to be seated at the restaurant Paul Bakery. I think I was also attracted to the great bakery smell wafting through the walkways. After being seated, we ordered and split a bowl of broccoli soup and two outstanding sandwiches. The soup was exquisite and the sandwiches were wonderful. We sat in the outside walkway and were able to wach people as we ate. Of course after eating lunch, we had to take a box of two bite sized macaroons with us for later endulgence. This is a French boulangerie/patisserie at it's best and it was packed with customers."
French,Paul,Pastries still the specialties ,40,17 November 2012,"Went to Paul for a breakfast at around 10.30am Sat, already crowded with a lot foreigners and tourists, constantly having Short que. I ordered their breakfast set with sunny side up eggs and ham, and cafe mocha. My wife ordered the Grand Cafe with bread, The food were good, but not spectacular. The mocha was rich but too much chocolate, but this is their way. Later we order a peach cinnamon tart, which is excellent, but we were too full to order more pastries. So I would suggest stick with their pastries. The "
French,Paul,Bad and unfriendly service,20,3 September 2012,"My family and have been to Paul twice now, and twice it has been disappointing for exactly the same reason: Paul seems unable to make sure that everyone around the table gets their food at approximately the same time. The first time we had our three kids having to wait half an hour while my wife and I got our meals after maybe 10 minutes. And last time it was my wife who's breakfast hadnt even arrived when my kids and I were already long finished. Its not such a large restaurant, nor are the dishes very complicated, so it shouldnt be so difficult for Paul to serve everyone relatively quickly and at the same time.A friendly apology in such a case would go a long way, but the staff is very disinterested. They couldnt care less it seems. We had to cancel my wife's meal.It's a shame, if Paul could train their staff better, it would be a great (though still very pricy for such simple dishes) place for breakfast and lunch."
French,Paul,Excellent experience,40,22 August 2012,"Paul is on the 3rd floor of Ngee Ann building ( better known as the Takashimaya building) smack bang in the middle of Singapore's main shopping artery, Orchard Road. I just dropped in for a coffee and croissant and while the food was quite good, what really impressed me was the superb service. The lady who served me,Jennifer, was courteous to a fault, prompt and extremely efficient, qualities which are quite rare in the service industry in Singapore. She made my day, what more can I say!"
French,Paul,Excellent breakfast,40,19 August 2012,"I moved from France to the UK and then to Singapore. Singapore has a lot of western food out there to not forget your home country. Paul Bakery (which used to also be in Edinburgh, Scotland) is to me a very good place, where you can enjoy some really good pastries. I go almost every weekend for breakfast, where I order usually a Grand creme with a basket (croissant, pain au chocolate, half a baguette tradition and a briochette). My wife prefers savory food such as eggs, or salads. The pain au raisin (escargots) are fantastic. My daughter loves the macaroons. Fresh juice are also greatIt's a great bakery, where I am always looking forward to go.Having said that, I think there are some limitations, such as the bread choices. Bread is an old type so-called tradition which is harder to eat, because tougher and heavier. Then there is no choice between butter ie salted/unsalted. The fruit juices are sometimes too much loaded with water/ice. The portion are not consistent between the tables. The prices are rather high, but in line with western prices for a value for money ratio. More specifically to the Ngee Ann City's Paul, one of the major drawback is the queue to get in, the turnaround of the tables (some tables remains available but are not given) and the service can lack of efficiency.Anyway, I would recommend this place."
French,Paul,Nice European Style Cafe and bakery,40,8 August 2012,"This is a really nice café, right on Orchard Road, next to Takashimaya departament store. They serve light meals with the most exquisite cakes. Very busy on a Sunday lunch time, service a bit slow. Not cheap"
French,Paul,Nice environment,30,11 July 2012,"Went there for breakfast as the breads, pastries and tarts look tasty. The place was very nice though but the breads are some how a little disappointed. The baguette was a little under proof as the result for after baking, the bread was soggy on the inside, very chewy. The other food wise was so so. Service wise was excellent. Good service and courtesy."
French,Paul,Breakfast,40,10 July 2012,"Went there for breakfast, breads were not great but good pastries and excellent services"
French,Paul,Middle of the (Orchard) Road...,30,23 June 2012,"I spend some time with friends sampling food at Paul's...it's located, conveniently, right in the middle of Orchard Road at Ngee Ann City, better known as Taka!In short, it's a salad place, the service a little of an afterthought and the name more of a hype. The queue is long and the food is just not great. The tables are placed close together and an overall sense of claustrophobia is prevalent. However, try the salads, they are fresh and creatively mixed with prawn or chicken and make for a good healthy stop-over break from luxury shopping."
French,Paul,Good food; service can be improved :-),30,28 May 2012,"The last time I headed down to Ngee Ann, I noticed that there was a new restau. I was quickly intrigued by the new place upon seeing from afar that 1.) the interiors looked very nice, 2.) the place was packed (a good indicator that it's a must-try), and 3.) there was a queue just outside the dining place. Some friends and I recently tried Paul for a Sunday brunch. Because we arrived at the place around 1130, we didn't have to queue for long to get a table. Our table was very near the bakery of the cafe, which gave us a good view of all the baked goodies. I was more excited about the breads rather than the brunch menu. Hehe!I ordered the Crepe Complete - turkey and cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. It also came with a small portion of greens. For dessert, we got a fruit tart, a lemon tart, Napoleon, and macarons. I must say that I enjoyed dessert more. While the crepe tasted nice, I would have added a few more dollars to what I paid and I could have had a bigger brunch plate at one of the other brunch places around the island. The desserts (and most probably the breads) would be the main reason to head to Paul. Just beside the restau, the bakery would be found. The few hours we sat there, there wasn't a moment where there was no customer buying baked goodies. Really nice. What Paul can improve on is the service. It's kind of challenging to get the attention of the wait staff. Sure, the place was packed but that has never been an acceptable excuse for me. Nevertheless, I think I will go back to Paul to try the mains or if I happen to be in the area, and I'm craving for some nice pastries or freshly baked bread."
French,Paul,Up to Expectation,40,21 May 2012,"I have always been a fan of Paul in Paris. The one in Singapore has lived up to my expectation although the food seems priced compared to those in Paris. While the Paul in Paris is a common bakery, the Singapore one looks too posh for the common people. The food is just as good. Overall, I am contented that Paul finds its way to this Southeast Asian ""little red dot""."
French,Paul,"Tourist don't go, Singaporean don't bother, Ngee Ann basement offer better food",10,6 May 2012,"I heard of this restaurant from my friends 8 months back. Decided to try it.Initially I thought that the restaurant was very nice with the queue. Only to realised that they actually kept the tables empty to create the queue.Google ""Paul Bakery Hungrygowhere"" you'll probably find more negative comments on the Paul Bakery.Things that went really wrong:- coffee was way too acidic- chocolate cake was worse than me making a brownie instant mix. I'm not kidding- creme brulee taste worse than instant mix as well- crepes was average- service is really badSummary it's a place that looked European but serve really lousy desserts. Menu looks nice but it don't taste nice at all. Totally disappointment, spend SGD 42. I'll probably feel happier spend that amount in Ngee Ann City Basement.I'm writing this review because it's definitely NOT worth the visit and the high review on Trip Advisor is totally misleading. If I'm the tourist, I'll be totally pissed off if I tried this place. Singaporean, please just go to basement, the food there MUCH better than this place."
French,Paul,Best bread and pastries,40,29 April 2012,I was looking forward for the opening and Paul meets my expectation. Bread and pastries are the best in town. But I found the restaurant too pricy to seat and take away is a better deal.
French,Paul,"PAUL, Maison De Qualité 1889 [Singapore]",40,27 April 2012,"For full story, please go to www.epinosh.comMy story with PAUL café has began. It was a delayed encounter with the renowned boulangerie from the Northern France. Since its inception in 1889, it has franchised more than 400 bakery café world-widely and Singapore seems to be the latest venture in Asia.Speaking of the crowds at PAUL, I was terrified. I have heard of people making a beeline at the café entrance and that the restaurant waiting service has been poor, kitchen almost went into retardation, food quality didn't match up and the negative response goes on. That was probably 3 months ago when it first welcome its diners in Singapore. I am not totally surprised by the teething issues they faced,  given the outlet is the first in Singapore. For dinner, I ordered Croque Saumon Poireaux. The roast salmon and leeks married well! Embedded between those cheesy toasted bread, they are so moist and delicious! The whole dish was not overly bready.Another came along; Crepe Complete. It is turkey & cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. Interestingly, the oozing cheese fills up your oral cavity while its aroma chalked up your nasal concha!I decided on Hot Vanilla Milk to interact with my food. I have to admit my ignorance.. I have thought that ""milk is an unsweetened drink"" and it turned out to be sugared? Levelling up my knowledge, I owed it to PAUL. The vanilla milk was a real classic; nicely infused and not artificial.    "
French,Poulet,Decent food however not worth the price.,30,21 September 2018,"Visited this place with my gf for dinner. The service was good however the portion sizes werent exactly large. Even though the food tasted pretty good, I wouldn't return because of the price. I feel the price they charge isnt realistic for what you get, there are far better options out there for that."
French,Poulet,Affordable Lunch,30,2 December 2016,"Been years since we last visited. We ordered their set combo for 2 pax. Very satisfying and filling combo set which includes 2 choice of drinks, 2 x mushroom soup, 2 side dishes, Salad de Paris and Poulet Roti.The chicken was deeply flavoured with a tint of citrus taste in the meat. We felt the mushroom chardonnay sauce was unnecessary because that would actually cover up the aroma from the meat and made the chicken skin less appetising. Overall experience "
French,Poulet,Most tender,50,21 November 2016,"This place primarily serves roast chicken. However, unlike most of the dry bland roast chicken served in most places this restaurant has the most tender chicken I've ever eaten. On top of being perfectly cooked the chicken was served with two of the most flavorful sauces I've ever eaten. Side dishes were good but the chicken was perfect and merits a return trip! "
French,Poulet,Perfect food and very good people,50,20 October 2016,"I eat several times here as i stay long in jurong east, it is hard to find a place if you dont book in the weekend so only by this you can see that it is a good place, i advice the mushroom soup, paris salad and lamb hank"
French,Poulet,Affordable French Cuisine,40,26 March 2016,"I had the Poulet Roti with Mushroom Chardonnay Sauce, the Tiramisu in a bottle, and the Creme Brûlée. The price was not too pricey yet I could smell and taste the truffle mashed potato that I had along with the entree."
French,Poulet,good food,40,29 February 2016,we were really just walking around the place looking for somewhere to eat and i'm so glad we came across this restaurant. their escargot was so good and the roast chicken with chardonnay sauce was excellent! everything else was good too.
French,Poulet,Great dining experience,50,2 October 2015,We stumbled across this little restaurant and Oh my gosh I'm so glad we did. What an amazing meal!! The food was cooked to perfection. We had the chicken and lamb shanks... the meat just fell of the bone and the chicken was so tender. We enjoyed it that much we went back the next night and it was just the same. Absolutely exquisite!! A great meal for a great price. This place is an absolute must on your dining experience in Chinatown! Well done Poulet and compliments again to the Chef! 
French,Poulet,Worked For Us,40,21 September 2015,"Our hotel was across the road from the Chinapoint Mall so it was the obvious place to look for a meal. We stopped over for just one night, and thoroughly sick of the heavy meals in the UK, we were looking for somewhere to have a decent light salad for lunch before heading to the airport. It is difficult to find salad in Singapore but Poulet had three different choices. We chose smoked duck, which was melt in the mouth stuff; the various components of the salad that went with it were lovely and fresh, with a very nice raspberry oil drizzled over it. It was a quiet day with only one other table being occupied, and being lunch time I had an iced tea and my husband only had water, which was offered as soon as we were seated. The service was friendly (a staff member offered to take a photo of the two of us at the table) and immediate - we couldn't fault it, and the price was what we expected - quite acceptable."
French,Poulet,Could have been better,30,14 July 2015,"Poulet occupies a choice location on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Point. It's normally packed at lunch time and on weekends but it was relatively quiet on a Monday night. I decided to order their signature dish, the poulet roti (rotisserie chicken) which came in a shallow dish of mushroom cream sauce with some spinach leaves sprinkled around ($15.90 for half a chicken). My dish arrived incredibly quickly, possibly within a minute. The cream sauce was quite nice and the half portion of chicken was more than enough for one person. However, it was clear that my chicken had been left for too long on the rotisserie as the breast meat was a bit dry and the thigh meat was alright but not juicy the way freshly roasted chicken should have been. The thigh meat had also darkened in colour, indicating that it had been heated for a while. I also found the dish a bit salty. The marinade had penetrated the thigh meat, but that meant it was also on the salty side. Perhaps if it had been a busier day, the turnover of dishes would have been faster and I would have received a more tender and juicy chicken. My glass of water was, as other reviewers mentioned, 50 cents, although to be fair, the waitress did highlight this to me beforehand. However, it was a nice, quiet venue to catch a quick dinner and the staff were quite friendly and attentive."
French,Poulet,Thirsty? We don't care.,20,8 July 2015,"This one gets a 2 because the food was good. We asked for 4 different dishes and all were well made, better than expected for such a restaurant. But a restaurant is not only about the food. There is more pleasure in eating good food when the service makes you feel welcome, and Poulet did not make us feel welcome. What irritated me is that we had arrived feeling very thirsty and we were not offered a glass of water. I could see a jar of water by the cashier and waited many minutes to see a waiter on site. When I finally got a waiter, I asked him for cold water to which he replied that they had no cold water but only hot water and that the glass would cost us 50 cents a piece! This is something I've never heard of: restaurants charging for tap water. Water is a basic need, especially in hot places like Singapore, and it should be common courtesy in a restaurant to serve it liberally. I only did not get up to leave because we had 2 hungry kids with us. We ended up asking for mineral water because we'd not pay for tap water, much less hot tap water (Yes, I know this is exactly what they wanted us to do). Poulet really lost me there. I'll never return because I see this as pure stinginess. Considering their high prices (you've got to ask for a few side dishes in order to get a complete, balanced meal with your expensive half chicken) and the fact that customers do pay for service charges, it's really bad and absolutely unreasonable that they would not serve cold water; therefore, I'd rate it a no-no for customer service friendliness, which -- let's be frank -- is all what a restaurant is about apart the food itself."
French,Poulet,Quick lunch in Bedock Mall,30,3 July 2015,"French style chicken place, very resonably priced lunch in a Mall.Simple fast and good tasting food, service was Ok i had the Belly pork, a little on the small side as portions go, especially as they are serving half a chicken for teh same price, one of our group had an open sandwich which more resembled a Pizza nice all the same."
French,Poulet,Uncomplicated French lunch,30,24 June 2015,"The three things ambience, food and the services make together a great dining experience - of which service is made finitely a strong point at least for this outlet. I had poulet roti half for the lunch at sgd 15.9 and topped it up by soup and ice lemon tea for another sgd 5. The mushroom soup was good - liked the bread crumbs. The chicken came in a pool of mushroom cream sauce - slightly salty but ok to my taste bud. The half roast quantity was generous - can easily be shared. The ambience was interesting with the open kitchen - overall overpriced for local standard but underpriced from French dining perspective - overall average and uncomplicated. "
French,Poulet,A cuisine is not just assemble ingredients in a plate,10,21 June 2015,"Went to the Chinatown Point branch.First time I tried a ""French"" cuisine, and it is disappointing. We order half a roasted chicken that they are famed for. The chicken tasted bland, and at most, it is only warm, not hot. I suspected it was micro wave before serving, (the chicken skin is soggy as well). It was served on a big plate of mushroom cream sauce, but, when dipped with chicken, the cream overpower the chicken taste. you are effectively eating cream.Second dish is Duck with red wine. There is no taste of red wine in it. Again, the duck thigh is lukewarm, soak in the so called red wine sauce. The duck taste bland too, and it is too dry and hard. and quite an obvious smell of frozen duck. Both dish is a typical example of, just assembling ingredients together in a plate, and called it a dish.Where has all the culinary goes?Paid about S$16 (before +10+7 %) for above each dish. Though the ambient is ok, but not worth the eat. For foreigners, there is a food centre just right behind Chinatown point mall, plenty of good food there, get a half chicken, or half a real roast duck, and eat your heart out."
French,Poulet,quick!,30,5 May 2015,i had the duck and my friend had the lamb. both dishes looked pretty much the same. however the meat was fall of the bone kinda good! Had the Rasberry lemonade which wa snice but the creme brule was really nice! Tiramasu is served in a canister and its alright.
French,Poulet,Quiet Ambience amidst a crowded mall ,50,16 January 2015,"Signature full chicken with mushroom cream sauce was simply delicious. Goes perfectly with their chestnut rice. Tiramisu dessert was a nice end to our lunch.
Would definitely return again."
French,Poulet,Salty and costly food,20,10 January 2015,"Maybe it's our taste buds. But both my wife and I found the food to be rather salty. We both also had a feeling of wanting to throw up after the meal. Customer service was bad. Before clearing the used plates on the tables, they brought in another set of food and there was no place to put them on the table. Water is chargeable at 50 cents per glass. Came with high expectation but going off with dissatisfaction. Total bill was rather costly for two pax. "
French,Poulet,Not the second time,20,10 January 2015,"I visited this place as I was craving for French food but it is not really serving the ""amazing"" French dish. The poulet rôti and baguette are just too local."
French,Poulet,Westgate Poulet is the branch that we will stay away!,10,21 December 2014,"Having dine in many different Poulet, never had major issue with other branch. When we dine in the Westgate outlet, their food was below expectation, some of the dishes were too salty. Service was horrified, they are under staff with poor management. This is one Poulet our family will stay away. "
French,Poulet,Reasonable price. Good quality food. ,40,13 December 2014,"Recommend their signature roast chicken and the mash potato. Definitely suitable for families of all ages. mash potato could be serve to the kids, yummy and average portion to share. Another to try is their escargot. I liked the way how it is served and most importantly the salsa sauce. Flavoursome! Will definitely go back again. "
French,Poulet,Tasty French cuisines with a decent setting,40,1 October 2014,The signature roast chicken with cream based sauce was amazing. The staff were pretty friendly and the food came in within a reasonable time. All in all it was a very pleasing experience and we would go there again for a nice and pleasant meal which doesn't cost a fortune.
French,Poulet,Best Poultry Meal,50,13 August 2014,"Together with my wife and daughter we had great, delicious and affordable lunch @ Poulet. Must try their mashed potato and mushroom soup that taste just heavenly. Must try!Poulet Diane Half $17.90Salad De Canard Fume (Smoked Duck) $12.90Mashed Potato $4.90Mushroom Soup $5.9010% Service Charge $4.147% GST $3.20Total for 3 pax only $48.96 (If you have a bigger appetite please order a full bird) Enjoy!"
French,Poulet,Amazing food,50,6 August 2014,This place is incredible! the food and deserts are delicious... If you go to Singapore you have to try the roasted chicken with mushroom and the tiramisu! Love it!
French,Poulet,"For the price, very good.",40,26 July 2014,"Both chicken dishes are great. The pork belly is great. The tiramisu is fantastic. Each main course range from 15 - 20 dollars, and for that price the food tastes pretty good. The roast chicken is supremely tender with a stunning sauce to go with it. Highly recommended for casual diners."
French,Poulet,Inexplicably popular below-average restaurant,20,30 June 2014,"This seemed to be hugely popular with locals so we gave it a try. Sadly I can't understand for the life of me why it's such an attraction.The signature dish, chicken, is OK. To western tastes the standard cream & mushroom sauce will likely be far too sweet (I'm pretty sure it was mostly condensed milk, not cream) and although the chicken is OK it's nothing special and needs the sauce as the breast can be a little dry.The sweetcorn potato side order was tiny and tasteless, the fries were fine (though it's hard to screw those up) and the overall experience felt like bad hawker centre fare.Service wasn't brilliant, our starters were completely forgotten and when ""they"" arrived they had forgotten my order. In the end, looking at 4 limp frankfurters on a plate and thinking they were far from French garlic sausage I just let it go. Condiments have clearly just been scraped onto the side of the plate from the jar and left a lot to be desired on the appearance front. At least we were only charged for the one starter that was delivered.In a nutshell it wasn't dreadful but against the competition I cannot for the life of me understand why this place is still in business and, seemingly, so popular. Even bog standard chicken rice is nicer."
French,Poulet,Tasty cuisine but no alcohol licence?!,40,29 June 2014,"This place is SUPERPOPULAR amongst the locals .... It is crowded with huge queues outside... Admittedly it is tasty French cuisine, consistent quality (we have eaten at the branches in Vivocity and Chinatown Point), small portions ... My 14 yr old daughter loves it. My biggest gripe as an adult is that it has no alcohol licence. Seriously, French food and no wine? Come on ..."
French,Poulet,Worth the try!,40,28 June 2014,It was my 1st french food experience Finally had the courage to give it a try at the Westgate outletStaffs was friendly and attentiveWaited about 20mins on a friday eveningThey took our order while waiting for our seat to be readyWe ordered1) Oxtail2) LambShank3) Their signature roast chicken4) Saute Mushroom5) Peach Clafoutis6) Apple TartThumbs up for all the dishes except I find the Lamb Shank abit tough but the Oxtail was my favoritePay slightly more than $80 for the above 6 itemsWill definitely go back again !
French,Poulet,French Roasted Chicken - worth the try!,40,17 June 2014,"Noticed this restaurant in several places, finally took the effort to try it at Westgate. Since roast chicken was their signature dish, I ordered a half portion for myself. You can choose Chardonnay sauce (which I had) or cranberry. Staff was attentive even though it was on a friday evening. Waiting time was reasonable. Chicken was cooked yet moist. The sauce had a nice balanced flavour to it, although I think some may think it a bit salty to taste.Tried the mash potato as a side, very creamy and enjoyable. Worth the try if you love chicken or just want to have french food at reasonable price."
French,Poulet,Poultry at Poulet is magnifique,40,6 May 2014,"Was my first time to Poulet (T3 outlet) at the invite of my friends. He was raving about the dishes, especially their poultry dish with mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Other than the poultry dish, we also had the french onion soup, the oxtail stew, some fries for appetizer and another friend of my ordered the brisket. The review: true to the recommendation, the poultry was very tender and moist. Apparently it was soaked in brine for a whole day before it was slow roasted. However, it did not go well with the mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Simply put, it was more like Carbonara sauce from a bottle off the supermarket shelves . There is no taste of mushroom or Chardonnay, just heavy cream. The french onion was average. Another dish worth mentioning was the oxtail. My wife had a few atttempts at making oxtail stew at home and the lesson learnt to a good stew is slow cook or pressure-cooking. Poulet did just that and the result is a tender, beefy oxtail stew. Though i did not taste the red wine in the red wine sauce, the oxtail itself was good enough. As for the brisket, forget about it as the meat was dry. Overall, i would recommend Poulet to my friends, though i would ask them to skip the ""Mushroom"" ""Chardonnay"" sauce and go for the poultry itself."
French,Poulet,fabulous!,50,12 April 2014,"A french style restaurant, very clean and fast service. the food are all good with affordable price. this is recommended restaurant."
French,Poulet,Poulet at Bedok Mall,20,21 March 2014,"Poulet - the Amazing French Roast Chicken .... as the name suggests, this should be the place for chicken lovers..... but somehow, the taste, presentation etc suggest otherwise. Recently I went to the branch in Bedok Mall, and I order the latest signture dish which is half rosted chicken served in ""freshly home-made orange sauce"" with bacons and purple cabbage, and also ordered a garden vegetables...The moment the food arrive, found that the chicken seems ""hot"" and when tasted the sauce.... feel terrible.... the sauce is COLD... normally we would expect the sauce also comes in hot.... then mixing the chicken with the sauce is really a bad idea... On top of that, since it comes with ""bacons"" in the sauce we would expect also manage to eat the bacons..... but imagine in the whole plates, I only manage to find 1 bacon ..... and the size..... 2cm by 1cm... that is how TINY the bacon can be!!!! Paying such a price for this kind of dish ???Then comes the fresh garden vegetables..... and I would say it is so salty and the presentation really cannot make it... look at the pictures and you will know what I meant.The food was nowhere near French. The service was below average. I wouldn't recomment this to anyone. So far this is the worst western food that I've had in Singapore. that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing..."
French,Poulet,Quite nice overall,30,14 March 2014,"Heard of the rather new Poulet opening in Singapore, and heard mixed reviews, so Edison*, Katherine and I decided to scout it out for our dining pleasure over lunch one day.They have many outlets, we chose the one that was closer to our workplaces in general - 133 New Bridge Road, Level 2, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413. The number is 6538 3595. There was no queue, so we snagged a comfortable booth seat.The interior of Poulet is relaxing, done in light hues and cushy seats, setting the perfect ambience for casual comfort dining of classic French cooking techniques. The contemporary concept of wooden tables and modern classic chairs made the place ideal for friends, family, colleagues and dating couples alike.After some escargots and soups, we had the Poulet Roti - their signature roasted chicken in homemade Chardonnay Mushroom sauce. The golden brown skin was crispy, and the inside was tender and tasty. Infused with the very delicious gravy, we all understood why this dish tasted divine enough to be the restaurant's signature dish.Served alongside the Poulet Roti was the Pressure-cooked Oxtail in Red Wine Sauce with Carrot and Onion. The oxtail was very buttery tender it floated into the mouth and just disintegrated smoothly, we were surprised. The taste was heightened by the impossibly delicious red-wine based gravy.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-poulet-restaurant.html"
French,Poulet,"If there is a 0, I would put it .",10,23 February 2014,Poor food poor service . Food served cold . Over staffing but they still cannot give me some attention.
French,Poulet,French style food,40,14 February 2014,"The food here is what I would call ' version"" of French food and not bad at all, whilst not being fancy at all. French style roast chicken is the signature dish here.The menu is neither extensive nor sophisticated but there is plenty to choose from and I was pleased with the choice.Portions are small-ish but I prefer it that way -- and for the price I paid this was a well cooked, tasty meal at a good price, in a pleasant little restaurant."
French,Poulet,Nothing Special,20,13 January 2014,THe name suggests that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing special or distinct about this place except for the name..... would not revisit again..... too many good options abound in this lovely city of ours to waste time and money on this.
French,Poulet,"Good food, good value",40,28 December 2013,"After watching a movie at GV, we came across Poulet so we decided to try it out. It's reasonably priced (about $15 per dish), for nice ambiance and good food. I ordered the mushroom soup and Salad de Paris and my husband ordered the oxtail dish and a side of baguette. The soup was very creamy but delicious and the salad was good but only consisted of tiny amount of avocado and slightly too much dressing (a little too sweet), but it was fresh and good. My husband's oxtail was incredibly soft and flavorful, but the slices of baguette (for $5) could have used a bit more butter and toasting (only the top one came out a little browned). Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will be back to try a few of the other items on the menu that looked good!"
French,Poulet,Love the roast chicken!,40,26 December 2013,"It's been a while since I ate at this place.... So perhaps my review's abit outdated?I went to the outlet at Bugis + in 2012 and then the one in Great World City early this year 2013...I really love the roast chicken.... Both times, the roast chicken was done just right... very tender and juicy yet the skin is crispy... I also had the escargots and loved them...We tried the tiramisu the 2nd time we went and was delighted with it.... Recently, it seems that everywhere I go, I can see Poulet... At the rate it's popping up everywhere, I hope the quality of the food will not drop... For the not so cheap pricing, the food better be good to justify it....I will review here again when I visit it the next time round..."
French,Poulet,"poor food, lousy service",10,3 November 2013,"Ordered 2 lamb shanks with 1 chips and 1 gratin potato sides along with 2 latte's.Lamb shanks arrived after only about 5 mins, and though nice and tender were only warm. Had to start eating these as they were going cold and had to ask 3 times for our side orders which eventually turned up over 5 mins later., the fries were nice but the potato in the gratin was over cooked. got asked 3 times while waiting for coffees which were average if we wanted to order anything else. I also refused to pay the service charge for such bad service and food quality."
French,Poulet,Good food,30,1 November 2013,"Good environment, it was not full so the service was good.I had the ox tail stew. It was very good , maybe a bit salty but the taste and the portion size were good enough. I have tasted the lamb in another occasion, it was good also. I just don't understand the policy of not providing water, we need to buy whatever we want to drink."
French,Poulet,"poor food, worse service",20,30 October 2013,"This is actually about the Great World City branch to which I went with my wife before seeing a movie in same shopping mall. We chose to share a whole roast chicken - their signature dish, which they call poulet roti. It certainly wasn't worth anything near the S$38++ they charge. While the cooking was acceptable, although possibly slightly underdone, the chicken itself was of battery-hen quality, and tasteless. We asked for what they described as a baguette to go with it - but it turned out not to be a loaf of French bread but instead just four thin slices of toast, each no more than a few square centimetres. The drinks were similarly expensive - and even glasses of warm water were priced at 50 cents each. But the poor quality of the food and the inflated prices are not the main complaint. The service was outright nasty. We were treated in an offhand manner from the start, the waitress making no explanation of what was on offer. When the food arrived we asked for extra napkins, so she brought us a plate. We asked for mustard; but she had evidently never heard of such stuff, although she managed to bring some after going off to ask for advice from colleagues. Then - oops! - I upset a glass of Coca-cola, drenching the table and seats and soaking my trousers. There was no one around to help, so I stood and up shouted out; when nothing happened I shouted louder - ""someone, anyone, bring a cloth!"" The waitress was standing at a nearby table, chatting. I shouted louder, my wife stood up and shouted, and customers at other tables stared at us. The kitchen staff stopped work and stared at us, but the waitress stayed in her position, still chatting. Eventually, after what seemed like an age, but was probably less than a minute, the manager came over, helped clean up and took us to a fresh table. He didn't seem surprised when I said I wasn't going to pay the 10 per cent service charge."
French,Poulet,Nice dining environment and service,40,24 October 2013,"Did not know that there is an outlet in Jurong Point, just was looking around in the mall for dinner venue, and came across this restaurant. I did not know about this restaurant much until recently my friend went to dine in their Bugis outlet, and was praising the food was nice. Therefore, my husband and I went into this restaurant to try as we trusted this friend's taste very much. First the environment, we were led into the restaurant by a waitress, there are outdoor seating and indoor seating and we chose indoor ones. The place is bright and tidy, with some photos of food on the white walls and some trees indoor. Nice and neat. Staffs were very courteous too. Food wise, I do not know what is the taste of Authentic French food, but all I know is that the food are nice, chicken are well toasted. The staff recommended me to try their popular Cranberry sauce chicken, which I think is not too bad, the mushroom soup is nice too but I do not like their French onion soup. My husband ordered the pork belly, which I had tasted and is better than my cranberry sauce chicken. Escargot is normal, nothing fantastic, but I like the dessert Tiramisu. Sweet on the top where the cream is and bitter at the bottom where the alcohol is. Price wise, is affordable, much cheaper than most French restaurants. It cost us about $75 for a plate of cranberry sauce chicken(half chicken), a plate of pork belly, a plate of escargot, one tiramisu, one onion soup and one mushroom soup, a few slices of baguette and a bottle of mineral water. But one thing many not happy with is the charge they imposed on water, they do not provide cold plain water instead they sell mineral water at 1.80 each bottle which can be shared between two persons, and they will provide warm water at 50cents each glass refillable. Well, some may think is unreasonable but I think it's a trend now as more and more restaurants are practicing this.So, if you are not so particular about getting Authentic French food and want a nice place to sit down and dine, this may be the one suitable for you. If you want to try very authentic French cuisine, this may not be one. It already called itself a casual French restaurant. As for me, I will go back again to try other dishes. Heard their mushroom and tomatoes not bad too!!!"
French,Poulet,French? Really?,30,23 October 2013,"This new eatery seems to be highly recommended by many friends on my Facebook so I thought will check it out at Great World City. We had the Sautéed mushrooms, french onion soup, roast chicken in champagne (?) sauce, the lamb shank and tiramisu for dessert. None of them were particularly fantastic. Mushrooms were ok, the poach egg added an interesting twist but that's about it. The soup and chicken are too salty for our taste and the white sauce that comes with the chicken taste milky to me - weird. The lamb shank is not bad, very tender and flavorful but Secret Receipts does a similar one. I was really looking forward to the Tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts. Again didn't impress me much, find the sponge a bit too dry but the cream is good! Like some reviewers said they do charge for water which I personally find it ridiculous - even if it's refillable. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon. "
French,Poulet,Quite a dissapointment,20,23 October 2013,"I had a quick lunch here. I tried the signature roast chicken and some mashed potato as side. The service and the atomosphere were OK, but the food is not great. The chicken was served with thick cream sauce. The sauce was too thick and I felt bit sick of it after having half of them. The mashed potate was creamy, but again, the taste is too rich. I did not finish the dish.I do not think I will go back there. For the price I paid, I could have something better."
French,Poulet,"So unlike French chicken
So unlike good food",10,23 October 2013,My wife who is French and I visited this outlet and was shocked by the lacklustre taste of the chicken apart from a sickly soy sauce it was disgusting the mash was a milky liquid akin to syrupUnseasoned and unedible the veg was greasy and over cooked in all after nine years here we agreed the worst food we have hadDoes not even deserve one star To be honest absolute crap
French,Poulet,Yummy! Value for money!,40,22 October 2013,"We had their signature chicken dish and it was tasty! The price is reasonable for such delicious French cuisine. The lamb stew was delicious as well, very soft and nicely cooked. The crews are friendly and fast. Overall it was a good experience. Will definitely visit again."
French,Poulet,Awesome salad and soup,50,28 September 2013,If you are on a restrictive diet then this is one of the places to go. Value for money simple meal but outstanding in taste. The soup and salad was excellent. A place to go often. Pleasant ambience and merits going often.
French,Poulet,Tasty. French Flavors in Chinatown,40,26 September 2013,"After feeling like something other than Chinese food we literally stumbled upon Poulet in china Point mall. The food was tasty, reasonable size and well priced. The staff were very friendly and we returned a few days later they remembered what we had ordered earlier. They changed a dish for one of our group who had special dietary needs. If you feel like a change when surrounded by a Chinese food give it a try."
French,Poulet,50 cents for water!,10,10 September 2013,This place is not cheap and even though our bill was over $50 they have the nerve to charge 50 cents for a glass of warm water. No class whatsoever. We will not be back and people should stop patronizing these small minded places. Is there no management?
French,Poulet,simply loving it. Nice roasted chicken.,40,6 September 2013,"Tried it without much expectation, just it turned out to be an ""eye-brown rising"" dish. we had the whole roasted chicken, it was so nice, the sauce wasnt too rich until you cant have a good taste of the chicken. It is a great combination between the sauce and the roasted chicken. We ordered tiramisu and the banana bread pudding. I will not say they arent nice, but i cant appreciate both of the dessert."
French,Poulet,Poulet Outlet at Chinatown Point,40,5 September 2013,The Oxtail De Bourguignon was tender and overall it was good. Portion is considered small even if you are a small eater.
French,Poulet,Not bad,40,4 September 2013,"A friend brought me to the outlet situated at Chinatown Point. The ambience was not bad, but pretty crowded on a weekday afternoon. The lamb shank was relatively soft as compared to other places, and the roasted chicken was quite well marinated. I ended off the meal with tiramisu, that was to my delight, not too sweet and a satisfactory portion."
French,Poulet,Well roasted delicious chicken,40,29 August 2013,"A friend brought me to Poulet at Great World City. We'd the signature dish - the roasted poulet and to my delight, it was well marinated and the sauce wasn't too rich. Definitely great price for a decent meal. I would certainly visit it again."
French,Poulet,Can't call it French but I loved the food,50,28 July 2013,"Everytime I pass this nicely decorated restaurant, but their menu seems nothing attractive. The menu lacks proper pictures and description, but today I was determined to explore their food. So, I choose mushroom soup, Chicken and Fig In-between sandwich and iced lemonade. I was really not expecting anything amazing, but when I tested the food, I just loved it. I will certainly recommend this restaurant to everyone. I loved the food, service, restaurant decoration,atmosphere and above all their extremely reasonable price."
French,Poulet,Less than mediocre; price does not match quality,20,28 July 2013,"I went here with average expectations - which unfortunately were not met. Everything on our table was sweet. The white sauce much-hyped chicken is much too sweet for our taste buds. The mashed potato is almost like creme caramel. For almost 30SGD for a main, side dish and soda, the price certainly does not match the quality. You have to pay 50cents for a warm water too - a disappointment considering that the food is already expensive as is. Do yourself a favor, and spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."
French,Poulet,Ce n'est pas terrible,30,24 July 2013,"We'd agree it wasn't too bad. The mains (duck, pork, lamb) were tasty. My baguette was a little stale and drinks were expensive. One of our party requested tap water (water is *recycled* in Singapore) and he was advised it's 50c a glass. We wondered how many diners would revisit after that lack of courtesy. Total cost was high, considering our order."
French,Poulet,Very tasy meal!,50,11 July 2013,"We visited the Vivocity restaurant and at first were a little turned off by the queue to get in but we were seated in 10mins. The staff were great. We went back twice as the meals were so fantastic and flavoursome as well as beeing a good price. On our first vivit we shared the Salad de Paris... AMAZING! and for mails the Poulet roti (signiture chiken dish) and the Iberico Pork Belly both were lovely! Mash potato is so creamy! The sauce of the signiture chicken is quite rich though. It was super filling and was under $45 for two of us. Tip: glasses of water are 30cents each and they are warm, if you would like it cold you need to ask for a cup of ice! We went back twice and I would go again! I highly recommend it!"
French,Poulet,Not too bad,30,10 July 2013,"I visited the one in Vivo City. I passed by it one day and there was a long queue, so I thought it must be good. Agreed with the previous reviewer that it could be too salty for some. I tried the Potato and Mushroom soup and the 'signature chicken"". I personally find that it's quite alright but not worth the queue i witnessed. The service was quite good though."
French,Poulet,Mass produced taste. Tries very hard to pass off as French.,20,2 July 2013,"Atmosphere is nice. Service is average. Price is very reasonable with good food quantity. However the dishes all tend to be on the salty side with their ""signature"" chicken taking the salt crown. Think of Poulet, think of Denny's."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Forgettable dining experience,30,15 October 2018,"A little french steak restaurant tucked away in tanjong pagar, this place serves my favourite combination of steak and fries.The portion was decent, the meat was tender and the fries that came with it was free flow. The wee burner that they kept our second portion of steak on did nothing, sadly. It was still room temperature The staff on duty made sure we got our second albeit small portion of steak, and also promptly topped up the sauce when we requested. In my opinion, there are other steakhouses which serves steaks that are just as good for at an even more competitive price and portion. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice and good price,50,10 October 2018,"This is my 2nd time visit, very nice steak with unique sauce, and the price is very reasonable, worth for money"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not worth if it’s a full price,10,9 October 2018,"The beef steak so so only, fries also normal with no dipping sauce. Poor service as staff seems more interested in giving their attention to foreigners than local!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great ambiance and excellent food. ,50,3 October 2018,"My family has been going here for years. The food is fabulous and the service is always excellent. Though they only offer steak and fries as the main dish, there are many appetizers and desserts. You can view the menu on their website. I particularly recommend the French onion soup. The French fries are absolutely delicious and all you can eat. Highly recommended. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One menu item is all you need!,50,19 September 2018,"Went here for a casual business lunch... what a great place.As far as I can tell, apart from the appetisers there is only one menu item which is steak and frites... and that’s just fine with me.Cute little place, reasonably priced with really great food."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money especially with time Chope voucher,40,18 September 2018,We got a good deal at 50% off with Chope vouchers . Steak was great and generous free flow fries even better. Only gripe about the place is tables were incredulously close ! I would don’t estimate at most 15cm apart thus no privacy for those looking for a nice quiet date
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Decent Steak!,30,17 September 2018,"The steak was well cooked but lady boss could be bit rude. We ordered a few mains to share, with a massive number of sides but she refused our request to top up for more fries as we were sharing mains *4 mains for 5 pax*. I'm sure the cost of our sides and desserts way exceeds the cost of another main. Don't blame her but it's just not very logical in our point of view."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Casual Business Lunch,30,9 September 2018,"Value for money due to promo, but steak didn't came hot , wish it was warmer,overall nice atmosphere."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very good value high quality meal,50,3 September 2018,"Very good value (coupled with Chope’s discount). Starters, mains and wine all very well priced. Will definitely visit again"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Desserts were great but steak is so-so,30,29 August 2018,"Steak was so-so, sauce was lovely and escargots too. Best were the desserts! The caramel lava cake was heavenly. Service was sparse, hard to get their attention."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sides surpasses the mains,30,25 August 2018,"Designed to be quaint, it resembles any steakhouse in France during the 80s. The place is very compact, like our Europe counterpart, so if you suffer from claustrophobic, get those few tables that are lined opposite to the stretch of tables with benches.We were promptly served complimentary rose white wine, and subsequently our orders taken. We took foie gras terrine, extra salad and XL steak fries. The staff kindly notify us that XL steak fries do not get fries and sauce refills.The foie gras terrine was so good, so yummy, it was the deciding factor for us to come back to L'entrecote again. The salad was fresh, so were the walnuts that accompanied it. On a side note, the portion of the extra salad was very generous, much bigger than the salad that comes with the steak. Then comes the long awaited steak and fries. We ask the sauce to be on the side as I am not sure if i would like the sauce. Sure enough, my palette does not feel comfortable with the taste so i use it sparingly. We ordered medium rare for the steak, as we usually would. It tasted quite raw and chewy. It was not what i expected at all. I guess its a simple cut with a mediocre grade. However, those killer fries will definitely get you addicted, like it did for my diner. Fortunately we do not have free refills because the portion of the fries were sufficient to fill us up.I would come back again for the sides, not their steak."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good Steak and Fries,40,18 August 2018,My steak was not the tastiest of steaks but it was cooked according to my request and it was lean. The fries were ample and very good. The sauce is also very good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and fries!,50,14 August 2018,"My husband and I have been here quite a few times, and the steak and fries is always excellent, and the sauce is the best! So we decided to go back on short notice last weekend. We forgot how good it is.. the steak is always very tender and the fries are crispy. If you order the regular portion, you get a few pieces of meat with lots of fries. Then when you manage to finish, you get more meat and more fries! For $35 (I think) this is just amazing. also, you get a salad with walnuts as a starter, and that's included in the price too. My husband always goes for the XXL portion, which is HUGE, but he somehow manages to finish it, this one is $55 I think. We love love love the place and will be back again soon!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing ,20,10 August 2018,"When you only have one dish cook it well!!Medium rare is very rare .... beware!Also why to restaurants bring appetisers and mains at the same time... school boy error, and then leave the main on the side to get cold before serving. Very poor."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was alright,30,6 August 2018,"Went slightly earlier before the dinner crowd and noticed that the staff were rather unfriendly and unattentive at first. Ordered the XXL to share and was informed that fries and sauce would not be unlimited since it was for sharing, which was fine as the amount of fries given was more than enough for us and they kindly served the entire dish in two plates. The tables in the restaurant were rather close to each other. So much so that another’s bum would touch our table while trying to get into their seat next to our table. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoy $50 Rubber Steaks Here!!!!,10,23 July 2018,"Absolutely terrible food. One of the worst meals I have had in DECADES. Steaks taste boiled. For those who truly know steak...Outback Steakhouse would be a DRASTIC improvement over this place-whats that tell you?. Food came out drenched in a gray sauce all smashed together with fries and a piece of steak that looked deathly underneath. After trying the food, we walked out laughing at what a poor attempt that was at being a restaurant and left to go to a legitimate steakhouse."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,What a surprise!,50,10 July 2018,"We literally fell upon L’Entrecote at Duxton Hill Singapore. We felt the need for a change & wandered to Duxton Hill just up from Maxwell Street. Such a surprise to come across an area without traffic and offering an alternate Singaporean experience. Loved loved loved our meal at this little French bistro. I am not a steak lover, but I cleaned my plate! Can’t rave enough about L’Entrecote and the Duxton Hill area. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Too cosy,40,2 July 2018,"This restaurant could be every steak and fries fanatic’s dream come true or not, it really depends on how much of a food snob you are.The tables and seats were too closely positioned together for my comfort but if you can overlook that bit during a crowded evening, then you have my admiration! Making a table booking was seamless, finding a parking lot is a headache.The no-brainer dish to order is steak and fries, and it comes served to you in two portions; the second portion of meat is placed on the tiniest candle burner on a side table. Do not succumb to your desires of wolfing the steak down because there is no third portion of steak. Do not get your hopes up! The fries are, however, generously rained down on your plate if you request for it. I found the steak dressing an overkill, but that is just my palate. Do book in advance, or just get prepared to be turned away. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food and service!!,50,22 June 2018,Food was great! Really liked that they left a bit of steak on a plate over a small fire to serve to us after we were about 15 min into our dinner so that the rest of the steak would still be hot. Good service too.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was good but felt cheated,30,14 June 2018,"Steak was great fries were even better.. However the staff asked me if i wanted water, and i said yes thinking it was non-chargeable.. before i could object she uncorked a bottle of evian water in front of my eyes. i looked down at the menu and was shocked to see it was $9! Foolish me for assuming water is free in an upscale european steakhouse, but still waitress could have been clearer and asked if i wanted bottled water."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy French Bistro,50,11 June 2018,"We met friends at L'entrecote for an impromptu dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant was full and buzzing when we arrived and we were welcomed warmly by the staff which set the standard for the superb service we received all night.The steak and fries were delicious (with the offer of unlimited fries being particularly dangerous!), as was the red wine and the three desserts we tried. A complementary Kir on arrival was a lovely touch too. We will definitely be back!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sinful steak & fries,40,2 June 2018,"This bistro style steak and fries place is a must visit if you want a relaxed evening without getting dressed to the nines.Just pull on your smart casuals and go there. Start with an order of buttered escargot. One of the best I have eaten. Dip chunks of bread into the butter sauce and enjoy the snails.For mains there are only 2 choices and of course you go for the steak & fries. The steak is covered in their signature sauce which you will definitely polish off with the fries after you are done with the meat. Admittedly my plate was as clean as Oliver Twist’s bowl. Greed has no limits and I enjoyed a House Dessert which was a white lava cake out of which oozed a whole lot of caramel sauce. Don’t miss it. Your visit will be incomplete.If you are in Singapore for a short trip or a long stay, do try to visit L’Entrecote. It’s worth it.Note: Go to the outlet at 36 Duxton Hill as it has indoor seating. The outlet at Orchard Road only has deck seating. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Always a nice French dinner experience ,40,29 May 2018,"Hadn’t been there for a while , but it didn’t disappoint at all. Still the lovely French atmosphere and the food was delicious and still big portions . We also had nice appetizer and the must is the desert, lovely choices. A wonderful evening and for my Duxton is such a lovely place that this is my favorite location ."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Almost in Paris,50,20 May 2018,"Very quaint little bistro for date night to reminisce of our time in Paris. Sure it was not the real deal but the food and ambience was a treat. Wait staff were superb, very attentive, service was fast despite the restaurant being full. We had the speciality, steak and fries, sauce was so yummy, we asked for seconds. The signature caramel lava cake and truffle brie topped the meal. Thank you for making our night special."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simply wonderful ,50,19 May 2018,"I visited with my family for a birthday dinner after a friend recommended. I am soooo glad we took her advice!Firstly, the service was awesome. We arrived quite late on a Sunday night, about an hour before closing, but there was absolutely no sense of being rushed by the team. The waiting service was super charming, and attentive without being “in your face”. But the steak and fires....oh my days! We chose the standard size for 35 bucks (with free flow fries). Steak was cooked to perfection just how each of us liked it. When it was served, I thought the portion was perhaps a little small...but after I’d eaten most of the steak, along pops the waiter with the other half of the steak that they had kept perfectly warm!! Such a nice surprise for a hungry boy like me :) And the fries kept coming as promised.The side salad and bread were fresh and delicious too. And the small Carafe of Bordeaux was an absolute dream!I honestly can’t fault this place. In fact we are going back for our last dinner in Singapore tonight!! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A evening dinner,30,11 April 2018,"Very good service from the beginning to the end of the dinner, really nice atmosphere and ok location. The food was ok but not special. The prices not too bad. But all in all a positive evening."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,BAD FOOD HIGENE ALERT!,10,22 March 2018,"BAD FOOD HYGIENE alert!!!!!!!!! My date and I went to this restaurant tonight, was suppose to be celebrating his new job. The starter Foe Gras Terrine was served with a big patch of Green Blue MOULD!!!the waitress apologised to us a few times "" I'm sorry, I think that one was EXPIRED!"" let me get you another one from a new batch, like anyone would be just fine with eating the animal organ gone bad!!! I better don't get food poison in the next 24 hours, Or I will definitely report you. if it wasn't my date insisted to stay, I would have walked out of that restaurant, My appetite was completely ruined, and they charged us for that dish anyways, that's how sorry they were! Sick to the stomach literately, I wonder if the food in that fridge are as fresh as the terrine! and the FRIES are served in whole big plate, BUT there's no ketchup, mayo, no dip! you must eat the fries DRY!! yes it was so fantastic $100 SGD dining experience that's disgusting!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Really disappointing,10,15 February 2018,"Was really disappointed with this place. I booked one week in advance for valentines day via Facebook. The restaurant confirmed with me and i even followed up on the day to reconfirn, When I arrived there was no booking under my name and we were ushered to the end of a 6 seater table layout with them pulling the table at the end out slightly. We asked to be moved. The steak and fries. Probably the worst version of French steak and fries I have ever had. Fries tasted like they had been dripped in fat and someone had clearly gone a bit heavy with the lemon mixed in the sauce that covered the steak.We were given a complimentary drink once we had to asked to move and explained this was supposed to be a valentines day booking (albeit no record of it at the front desk).This restaurant claims to be one of the most romantic in Singapore hence the Valentine day booking. Apart from the decor and Duxton Hill settings, not sure how they can claim this magical status."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Amazing!!!,50,15 February 2018,"Went to this place on Valentines night with my partner. We ordered the standard steak dish, medium rare, with fries. It did not disappoint! At only $35, this was easily the best steak and fries I’ve ever had. Melt in the mouth meat, crispy fries, and more food than I could finish.Really lovely atmosphere too, we sat outside and enjoyed the buzzing courtyard and music from next door.I highly recommend this place!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,meat& freeflow fries ? hell yeah,50,6 February 2018,"when i walkin down in duxton hill area i saw this resto and i decide to try they serve meat 150gr and 300gr and for the presentation they slice the meat into pieces and serve it with mustard sc and of course free flow fries!! great ambience ,good job!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Home made steak experience,50,29 January 2018,Great ambience and excellent food. Kept simple with the fact that you only order steak and fries. Just pick the appetizers if needed. Desserts were great. Highly recommend the caramel lava cake.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mixed feelings ,30,25 January 2018,I have been to this restaurant a number of times of the years. It feels like they still have the same ambitions but can’t really handle it. At the beginning of my dinner the service was top notch but as the place filled up I saw less and less of my waiter at the end they didn’t emptied the table before I got the check. Foie gras was ok the meat was ok the French fries was really good. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing steak,10,12 January 2018,"Went for the Christmas dinner menu with a friend and this is my first time there. This restaurant is supposedly special for their steak but it was chewy and bland. The very basic of salt n pepper rub prior to cooking the steak was not even reflected. The gravy was nothing to rave about either.Except for the fries and dessert, the meal was disappointing. Oh we had escargot for entree to share...again if there was no garlic butter cooked with the escargot the taste was bland. Understand you cannot get fresh escargot here but surely can be done better at this restaurant.We asked for tomato sauce for fries and they didn’t have...even the table next to us asked the same. Sometimes it’s not about what you want to serve but what the customer wants!!For the price they charge, I feel there’s better steaks out there.Decor was nice, French bistro feel but that won’t get me back there."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,steak could be more tender,40,9 January 2018,"i feel that for the amount paid, the food is value for money. the steak could be more tender but the sides, salad and sauce were good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Wine a Let Down,30,8 January 2018,"The food is great and of course who cannot resist those fries!!!! But the wine list is dismal and very over-priced. We couldn't drink the first bottle we order (it wasn't corked, it was just terrible), so we ordered a different bottle. Because it wasn't corked we were not looking for a refund, but I would have expected the staff to inquire why we were not drinking the first bottle and asking them to clear it and the four barely touched glasses. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Terrible steak,10,6 January 2018,Didn't expect to pay $50++ for this kind of bad quality steak... it's worse than what we can buy from any supermarket (discounted value)..
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good food, value for money",50,30 December 2017,"Food was good and value for money as the fries was free flow. Only complain if any is the space between the tables was very small, no privacy between other tables"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food with a great atmosphere,50,6 December 2017,"Steak and fries, two of my favourite food paired with an amazing atmosphere and excellent customer service :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A welcoming restaurant with great French Cuisine,50,4 December 2017,"We were there for the steak frites, which was rather good. The highlight was the French Onion Soup which our litttle girl loved a lot. Best highlight for the little lady was that they served her a complimentary nice non-alcoholic fruit punch and we had complimentary drinks too. A quiet relaxed ambience for a nice dinner, with excellent service which was not overly fussy. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great steak and fries,40,23 November 2017,"Good ambience, food was served quickly, unlimited fries, price was alright around 40+ per pax. Only downside was you won’t be able to bring your own dessert"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over rated steaks,30,16 November 2017,Steaks were not as tasty as we expected them to be. Over rated. Fries were addictive n good though. So was the bone marrow appetiser. The duck Rillete was a disappointment too.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very cramp restaurant,10,13 November 2017,My friend was made to squeeze in between tables with absolutely no assistance from the service staff. Horrible experience.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A pity they drastically reduced the portions ,20,12 November 2017,"Use to enjoy having a steak at the Entrecôte at Duxton every now and then but was bitterly surprised the other evening when we saw our steaks...considerably downsized! Really a pity because the location, ambiance and quality of food is good..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Delish!,50,8 November 2017,"The staff are brilliant, very efficient, very accommodating. The steak, sauce and fries are so delicious, that you continue to eat even if you are full from having a scrumptious starter. People wait for ages for a table without a booking, showing just how yummy the food is, but best to book in advance."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Big lover but too expensive ,40,1 November 2017,"I have always loved the entrecôte style of cuisine, and I haven’t been disappointed of the quality of the food. Although the prices are way too high for this type of cuisine. It is a shame because I’m sure that the restaurant could attract more customers by lowering their prices..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice steak,40,31 October 2017,L'Entrecote The Steak & Fries Bistro service one of the best steak in town.the fries are one of the best i had.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Rare find for a Saturday lunch,50,24 October 2017,Lucky to find this fantastic restaurant in Duxton Hill open for Saturday lunch when most other restaurants in the same area are closed.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Average steak; nice fries though,30,22 October 2017,"L'Entrecote is a restaurant with many starter and dessert options but just 1 main dish - the signature steak and fries. So non-beef eaters take heed! For steak eaters, you have the option of the regular (~190g) or XXL cut (~300g). Steaks were disappointing though. The issue wasn't with the doneness of the steak, but rather the questionable quality of beef being used. The fries were good though.Given the variety of steakhouses around, would probably not return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Steak, frites, house Bordeaux, what's not to like?",40,18 October 2017,"If a restaurant is going to only do one main course, it needs to do it well. I have tried similar establishments in other cities and after many times thinking about trying here we finally got around to it.We rocked up fairly early, sans reservation but got a table easily, however, had we been later it might have been different.No need for starters, straight to the chase. The only decision to make is how you want the steak cooked. I was surprised to see ""well done"" as an option - I went to a place in HK recently who stated they would only serve their steak rare or medium rare(!) - but we requested a point, and saignant (medium and medium rare) so that was fine. There was a fair wine list, but a bottle their own label Bordeaux looked the right choice and it was pretty decent.We toyed with our green salads with walnuts, they were OK, but salad is, well, rabbit food at the best of times.The steaks arrived after a suitable interval, plated up by the wait staff in the dining room and smothered in the Cafe de Paris sauce. And a few frites. Well, to be honest, a shed-load of frites. Verging on ""American"" serving. I would have preferred fewer and when we go back, as is highly likely, I will make the point of asking for less.Both were cooked well, and how I would have expected them outside France: in France medium rare is always closer to rare than say here.After making some inroads into the food, the waitress brought the rest of the steak and offered more frites: had I not eaten for a week I might have taken her up on it as they were good frites but having only the one stomach I passed.My only minor criticism was a slight lack of seasoning, but that is always to be expected in Singapore, the salt police have declared salt is A Bad Thing so I needed a touch more on mine.There was a dessert selection and having had the house main course, and the house red, we went for the house dessert to share, a salted caramel lava cake, a la mode. There was a warning that there would be 15 minute wait for said confection but that gave us time to reflect on the meal and begin digesting it.Dessert was quite reasonable and a good way to finish.Cost was pretty fair as well, $190 all in so as I say, somewhere to add to our rotation."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One choice,40,1 October 2017,"French to the core. Only one dish, steak frites. Both came out perfectly cooked as ordered. I would've preferred to forego the sauce on top, but my wife loved the sauce. Horses for courses. Massive amount of crispy frites. Feed two armies on them. Not cheap, would not want to spend that much every night."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So Parisien,40,27 September 2017,What was excellent is just how people can combine great quality with little choice. Good steak with excellent sauce. And no nonsense about wine. Not something like what kind of wine so you want? No Bordeaux otherwise go somewhere else. Had a very enjoyable evening with a reasonable bill. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Does what it says! French steak and chips!,40,23 September 2017,"Not sure why this place gets low ratings. You can see that it serves steak and chips with a lovely sauce and lots of lovely wines sitting outside in cool Duxton Hill.Service was pretty good, nice place to chill and relax and do some business."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak to my heart...,40,22 September 2017,"Ordered the onion soup, and for mains I had the classic steak and fries, which comes with a nice side salad so you get your greens too! Clue is in the name, for the mains your only selection is pretty much only steak and fries! You do get to choose between a regular or XL portion though. Go big or go home, full of yummy steak in ya belly... "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner with Friends,30,18 September 2017,"The atmosphere of the Duxton outlet was great, had pretty high expectations after having a fantastic meal at their Suntec branch (now closed) a few years ago.They wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived but did make allowances when we mentioned that it was a birthday surprise and we would like to be seated before the birthday girl made her grand appearance. Ordering and the delivery of food was fast. We were told while placing our orders that those who were sharing the XXL steak meal weren't allowed to have free flow fries, something that we understood and were absolutely okay with. What we were not expecting was that those who shared meals were not allowed to request for extra sauce for the steak, this was pretty ridiculous to us as we felt that we should at least be able to request for 1 extra serving of sauce per set meal - further more the steak was bland. Did not expect this kind of skimpy service from a restaurant that I presumed was more upmarket.Overall had an average night at L'Entrecôte."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,As expected,40,24 August 2017,"Very nice people, great steak and fries, good chocolate mousse.
This is a place that doesn't disappoint."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great ambience,40,23 August 2017,"Great ambiance, not over the top for casual dining. The steak wasn't exactly medium rare as requested (all of ours tasted medium well), but the sauce and fries were really good. Great service and we loved the rosé we had as a welcome drink!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Love the free flow fries!,50,23 August 2017,"This place is best for fries and steak. If you love your steak and fries, this is the place to go. They are very generous with the steak. You can always ask for top up for your fries whenever you are done. Good place for hangout with friends. Recommended to make reservations before heading down. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good service but food so-so,30,20 August 2017,"Guess the interesting thing about this place is that as the shop name denotes, you will have a Steak (done from rare to well done) and lots of fries as your main dish so no need to crack your brain trying to figure out what to order. They do have dessert and such. Service is fast and friendly."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unsatisfying Steak and Fries,30,14 August 2017,"This is the second time here, first time was a few years ago, however the quality and taste was a lot worser than the previous time. The sauce was more mustardy than the last memory there which didn't taste as nice. But the worst thing was that the steak was overcooked. Very light pink and no blood at all for a medium rare steak. And not to mention the really cramped seating :( This will be my last time visiting this place... "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,好漂亮的法式小酒館,40,14 August 2017,餐廳位於Duxton Street，很清幽，餐廳的裝潢就跟法國的小酒館一樣，不過晚上真的蠻嘈吵的。一坐下就有complimentary welcome drink。牛扒和薯條套餐有沙律和麵包，每人只是S$40左右，很划算。
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok,30,9 August 2017,Ordered medium well steak but it came well done - too charred and tough. Complimentary drink was good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cozy ambiance. No frills down right good stuff,40,7 August 2017,"Steaks are well prepared. Went for the XXL size and it's rewarding. Cooked just the way I wanted it. Fries I suspect were from the freezer, but still ok."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,quite good french foos in town,30,7 August 2017,"Food is quite good, do not expect the best at this price. Staff (filipinos) are warm, nice and efficient."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So so steak and poor hospitality,20,6 August 2017,"The taste of the steak was so so although it was nicely cooked according to our request. I am really disappointed with the super cramp space. The restaurant was actually empty but we were forced to sit at a table for two without no space to exit. The waiter refused to put us to a bigger table. When I asked why can't you push these tables so that we can have more space to get in and out our seat, the answer was simply ""this is our concept"". Then I replied...Oh it is your concept to torture your guest until we can't get out from our seat. If the restaurant was full, I would understand such refusal. However, it was very empty."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant experience,40,30 July 2017,"Had a pleasant experience dining at L'Entrecote. Ordered 3 appetizers (french onion soup, foie gras pâté and escargots) and the XXL portion of steak frites to be shared among us two. The soup was great, foie gras pâté was huge but delectable and the escargots were normal. The steak was tender but we were not fans of their special sauce which was a tad sour for our liking. Ambience and service were great though."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistent in their food quality and service,50,28 July 2017,"We frequent this restaurant often and the service and food is always good. The french onion soup is delicious. We normally get the steal frites and if not too full, we get a caramel lava cake. Be careful not to order too many appetizers or you will be too full for dessert. The house red is also very good. Highly recommended making a reservation if you plan to go as it gets quite busy. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Price for Good Steak,50,18 July 2017,"charming little establishment with friendly wait staff, the main draw here is the affordable steak that's for a pretty good standard, paired with free flow of fries and a starter salad. will definitely come back here again"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoyable experience,50,6 July 2017,"The steak was cooked quite well and the fries were addictive. The sauce, as advertised, was legendary and went well with both steak and fries. Desserts were good too."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Bistro on Duxton Hill,40,28 June 2017,"Great experience in Duxton, simple menu, great service and a good wine list. If you are looking for steak and fries this is the place, no frills no fuss and an easy decision making process. enjoy the food and sit outside on the street. Enjoy."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Below expectations,20,27 June 2017,"Was searching for a good steak house to celebrate Fathers day n since Lawrys only had available seating from 8 pm, i settled for this place after reading all the reviews.First of all for those driving, you must be prepared to wait as spaces are very limited.The place was small and cosy but aircon was very weak. Everyone around me was fanning themselves. Portion wise it was huge and they even came around with extras. But sadly none of us really enjoyed the steak. Maybe the meat was not of high grade so it was basically tasteless. Of course the sauce will cover it all but it was not enjoyable. Anyway wont be coming back any time soon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistently excellent food and service,50,20 June 2017,"My husband and I are regulars here, but we brought our two boys for the first time for Father's Day brunch. The food was excellent and a good size for two growing boys and the service was amazing as always :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Excellent food, service",50,19 June 2017,"The service was splendid, food was exceptional, both the steak and fries. Everything was just great."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Average,30,16 June 2017,"Food is average and passes the average standard, but below our expectations given its price. Better steak places out there."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent burger!,40,13 June 2017,"First time i had lunch in an outside place in Singapore but they have a very good ac-system. My food was really good but I missed a little salad with the burger. Other than that, reasonably priced, very friendly and swift service. Excellent for a quick lunch!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Delicious French Bistro fare,50,12 June 2017,Whatever L'Entrecote puts into their steak sauce it makes a to-die-for sauce! Simply the best steak & frites & secret sauce in Singapore. Topped off with a fabulous caramel sauce pudding in the style of a fondant au chocolat. Such a treat.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food,30,5 June 2017,"Space was abit too small. Tables were abit too close for comfort - would be great if they could distant them slightly. Nonetheless the steak definitely did not disappoint and we had a great evening. Not to mention, the staff were polite and sensitive to our requests. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Efficient Service, Food was great!",50,30 May 2017,"Very neat restaurant, fancy layout but simple yet delicious steak and fries just like their shop name. Love it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Once again a very good lunch...,50,24 May 2017,Have been here for business lunches on many occassions - the service is always very good and the food - although simple - is always great!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not the same,20,23 May 2017,"Lovely area and attractive restaurant, steak quite good, sauce nothing like the original concept, fries dreadful, being presented with the bill without having to ask is great except when you haven't even been offered a look at the dessert menu."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing this time....,30,16 May 2017,"We have been to this restaurant many times, the steak was very disappointing this time we actually left most of it - such a shame as it was a birthday celebration meal"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good for couple alone time on non-peak hours,40,14 May 2017,"Everything was wonderful except for the sittings. The tables were too packed closely to each other, didn't have enough privacy for talking."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,No Words,50,9 May 2017,"I do not need to say much about this place as many people will have visited at one of their locations and know their secret sauce. This is a franchise and I had previously visited in Canary Wharf. It was perfect for our first night in Singapore, good food with ample portion size. No one else in my party had been to L'Entrecote previously and they were impressed and will return to a home location. The setting is really romantic and the service was fabulous. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,quite decent French food,40,8 May 2017,Food is not bad at all. Some starters are good (foie gras terrine) and more interesting than main courses. The place can be very noisy at times.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not bad,40,8 May 2017,Food is good. Service is good. Just that the place is very cramp. Overall not bad. Will visit again if there's a chance. :)
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinning experience,30,5 May 2017,Not crowded when we go In the afternoon. Service so so not the typical Italian or French restaurant service. If there's lunch set would be good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,The steak!,40,5 May 2017,Loved the steak with the sauce. Sauce truly made the dish. Fries were nice and crisp. The salty caramel cake was the perfect way to end the meal.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent food and service,50,3 May 2017,There are no words that can explain the experience you receive in this bistro. The food is amazing and the service was perfect. I highly recommend this place!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistently Very GOOD!!,50,12 April 2017,Our go-to-place to get our Steak-fix. Always good quality and very yummy!!! Good value for money :))
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent,50,8 April 2017,"This was our second visit. As we both adore the vast arrangement of the desserts, we opted to share a main, and share 3 desserts ! The steak was beautiful, perfectly cooked to our requirements. We were advised that as we were sharing a main, that ""free flow"" of fries would not be available, but we could not finish the huge amount that was served to us! The desserts are stunning, great choice and a good size. A joy to return. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great,40,28 March 2017,"Had a high expectation on the Wagyu ribeye but it wasn't as good as expected, which wasn't value for the money. I requested for a small surprise for my Boyfriend's birthday and the staff assisted me for it. Service was excellent! And for those who love fries, they do top up fries for free!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good steak, not as good as the one in Paris",30,25 March 2017,"The sauce not as smooth, the beef was also not as good. However overall still nice. Love the fries. The seating is very close in between chairs. Not a good place to have conversations."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food and great service,50,22 March 2017,"This restaurant only has one main dish, steak and delicious unlimited, all-you-can-eat French fries, but they have several appetizers and desserts. I try to eat mainly vegetarian, so just had bread, cheese and salad and then French onion soup as my main even though it has beef broth. The only other two vegetarian options are endive salad (with blue cheese and walnut) and the classic Parisien leek & vinaigrette, which I have not had, so cannot comment. They are very child friendly and in a lovely location. Definitely recommended. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent food ... disappointing wine.,40,20 March 2017,"L'Entrecote have some of the best steak and chips in Singapore, and the prices are good. The formula is adjusted slightly from the original restaurants in Paris and London - they offer starters in Singapore, and the seating is less ""intimate"". However, it still works - the restaurant is a favourite for me.The wine however is awful. Super ordinary (and super cheap) French and Aussie wine is priced up to $100+ a bottle and it spoils the experience somewhat. It's strange as the L'Entrecote Wine Bar next door (which also sells steaks, and presumably shares the kitchen) has a good wine list. A new sommelier or wine buyer is urgently needed!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great fries & wine - steak okay - limited vegetarian options,40,20 March 2017,"We came here for an early dinner on a Sunday with our 3 kids - 2 are steak eaters, 1 is a vegetarian. It didn't occur to me to check the menu in advance but there are VERY limited options for vegetarians - basically onion soup, salad and fries.The meat eaters in our group enjoyed the steak, though it was a bit chewy and didn't seem to be a great cut of meat. However we enjoyed the ambiance, fries, and house wine. Welcome drinks were a nice touch. Service was great (though there were only 2 other diners at the time we were there).I'd come here again with friends instead of kids and soak up the ambiance. :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty,40,19 March 2017,"We went there early thus the service very attentive. Nice touch that they gave complimentary rosè wine. Ordered the steak with fries. Their steak sauce was a touch acidic (sour), too sour for my liking. The French fries was cooked well, well seasoned and crispy."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and good,40,14 March 2017,"Good ambiance, great food, nice service.
We enjoyed a drink before the meal, then we had the usual entrecote with fries, which was just right, then we finished with dessers which were real good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great place for steak,40,26 February 2017,"If you enjoy steak and fries but hate paying absurd prices... this is a great place to visit! The steak is more minute steak with a very nice sauce, fries are all you can eat and you feel like in a tiny French restaurant... Definitely a new addition to our regular places! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unlimited fries (and steak!),40,14 February 2017,"I've read everywhere online that this place is amazing for steak and fries - I mean how can they not be, if that's the only thing on their mains menu? I also read that they have unlimited fries, and not only did they deliver on that, they also gave everyone extra steak! Not sure if it was just the weekend that I went (which was the weekend right before Valentine's Day), but no complaints here!The restaurant itself is extremely crowded and you're barely 20cm away from the next table because they cram a table into every single area available, but their turnover is super fast and they're very efficient. The ambience and food is so good that after a while you forget the crowdedness anyway.Overall, great food, great service and I would totally come back again!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Misleading,20,11 February 2017,"Food is not good. French fries at Mc Donald are better. Steak is OK. The pepper sauce is something... I don't know.
Being Belgian, you would expect in a restaurant pretending to be French some French food. Disappointing!
Environment is fantastic. Waitress was very kind!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Expensive food and so-so beef,30,23 January 2017,"Had their famous steak and fries, only their sauce was amazing. Steak was so-so, too chewy and not tender enough. Fries overly fried, if not for their steak sauce, everything was boring. Won't be coming back again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,What's not to like ,50,21 January 2017,Classic steak frites place - a complimentary glass of kir to start. They do have a menu but most people go for the salad with walnut to start followed by the steak frites - enough steak for 2 portions and as many fries as you can eat. Wash it all down with a bottle (or 2) of the house red!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice time spent with friends, but the steak could be better",40,17 January 2017,"The steak was not as good as expected as it was pretty dry. But overall the service and environment is nice. Their sparkling water is surprisingly not free, so be cautious when the waitress asks you whether you want water or sparkling water."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and chips,40,17 January 2017,"This is a small place, but if you want a great steak and chips then look no further. The meal was delicious, cooked to perfection and I could easily go back for more. My friend and I did not experience any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned - we were served well, and ate at our leisure. The whole Duxton Hill area was really nice too. It has a really relaxed atmosphere with a huge variety of restaurants and bars with flavours and options from all over the world. Would like to explore more."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Awesome service but subpar food,30,15 January 2017,"Had very high expectations of the steak with their in-house sauce but had to say my partner and I did not enjoy the food. But, they had excellent service!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Just Like Eating in Paris,40,6 January 2017,"I'm a big fan of the Paris chain Le Relais de L'Entrecote, which offers a simple menu of salad, steak and frites along with a mustard based sauce. Well, Singapore's L'Entrecote absolutely nails it! It's not as good as it's Paris counterpart, but pretty darn close. I wasn't disappointed, and would go back anytime. They have a decent wine list, as well. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Very Average and Very Rushed Experience,20,5 January 2017,"The idea for this restaurant is a good one, but it is poorly executed. I agree with other reviewers about the patrons being packed in too close together. My main beef though (pardon the pun) is with the service. We were barely inside the door 15 minutes when our mains were served. This is really not on in a restaurant that is less than half full. Wine prices were steep relative to the modest quality of the food. The short point is this: the Duxton Road/Hill precinct is packed with better value options - you don't need to chance your arm here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L entrecôte,50,3 January 2017,I booked the restaurant last minute but they were very accommodating. French onion soup and steak was very good
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,dinner on new year eve,30,3 January 2017,"tables were quite close but service were relatively good.
food was just average, steak and fries were served cold"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Bad ambience,30,28 December 2016,"Seat was packed too closely apart from each other, no personal space provided to diners. We ordered the beef marrow and two portions of steak; do not get the beef marrow, it was a waste of money($24?!)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Quality Food,40,28 December 2016,The quality of the food and service is pretty good. The only thing lacking is the space between tables. Very narrow even for petite size.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible service!,10,27 December 2016,"Given a previous good experience at L’Entrecote, I decided to visit this place again for a Christmas dinner with my friends. However, both the food and service were highly disappointing. I will not be returning to this restaurant again. Food: Fries were good, beef was okay. It was definitely a lot better during my previous visit. Service: Unacceptable and poor service. The entire meal was so rushed it was like we weren’t welcome. - Over an hour, 2 servers asked me 5 – 6 times on whether I was done with my salad (though my plate was not empty & I was still eating)- Bread basket was not empty, server asked if they could take it back as they ran out of baskets (restaurant was not full, and we were obviously not done)- Asked to clear plates though there were still fries on them and we were still eatingWe made excuses for them and even thought through the different scenarios in which this could possibly be acceptable but nothing can hold. - Attentive service: They could be said to be really attentive. I was even appreciative the first few times they had asked. But multiple times when we are obviously not done – that’s not providing attentive service- Meal time limit: Understand this happens at some restaurants. But if so, this should’ve been mentioned during reservation or at the beginning of the meal. Nothing was said- Full restaurant with a queue outside: Restaurant had empty tables, no queue outside- Making space for other dishes: The table had more than sufficient space or nothing else was coming - Taking too long for our meal: We were there from 7pm to 8.15pm. I would think it’s normal to take 1 – 3 hours for a meal at a nice restaurant? We were there for slightly over an hour – more than within acceptable limits if there are any Overall, this was very disappointing. The food and service level has declined significantly and I will not be back again. For a similar price range, you can definitely get better food and service elsewhere."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy atmosphere,40,23 December 2016,Love the service by the.. manager? Really attentive and nice. Beef steak was great as always! Love it
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Always good steak,40,21 December 2016,"We have tried other steak restaurants in Singapore but keep coming back to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill. The steak is always trimmed of fat, cooked exactly as requested, the sauce always tasty and the portions a good size. The service is always at a high standard. Fridays and Saturdays are always busier with the nearby bars open, but it is very quiet and easy to get a table on Sunday nights."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is disappointing,20,12 December 2016,Steak is no good (probably a raw material issue) but sauce is tasty. Appetizer n dessert are yummy though. House red wine taste too plain. Since the main course is key overall dining experience is below average.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dining experience at L'Entrecote,50,12 December 2016,"Had a very good experience there, just that I didn't know they charge for the water. But for the price, it's totally worth it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak and reasonably priced,40,11 December 2016,"Good food and ambience, steak was good and the fries was so yummy, my profiteroles dessert was so so good. price was not too bad, will definitely come back"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food with excellent atmosphere,50,8 December 2016,Its a good place to go to if you want a quiet evening with your other half. It comes with a complimentary drink when you first enter.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over-rated,30,29 November 2016,The portion of the fries wasn't distribute well. Presentation was very bad. The whole chunk of fries over the steak. We wasn't told that there 2nd serving of steak. But the salad was very nicely done.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Poor service...food average for price.,20,4 November 2016,"Went there on a Friday night with friends. It started raining and although it had a covered tent, the rain was hitting the table. We asked to move to the same-name bistro bar next door that was empty, but they insisted on staying at our table and that the rain would not last long. The food took a very very long time to arrive and it was OK, but nothing to write home about. for the price, I will not go back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and fries with great sauce :),40,1 November 2016,"Went today for lunch and really enjoyed it. Getting a second helping of steak and fries was a big bonus. The sauce was also great. I would ask for a better choice of wine by the glass for the lunch crowd tho. As a bottle at lunch is not the best idea for a productive afternoon. I could imagine it would get pretty cramped when busy as the tables are so close together that you have to move them to get to the bench seats. And even then anyone to large may be knocking over glasses!Would defo go back, as $35 for good steak frites is pretty reasonable."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Never again!!!,10,18 October 2016,"Last night, we have made the unfortunate mistake of visiting L'entrecote. This is a place we have been couple of times and generally left satisfied since the menu is very standard and the quality of the steaks were good. Armed with our appetite for steak and fries, four of us decided to visit the place as a walk in customers. (Two other friends were on the way to join us for Cigars and coffee) The location doesn’t accept reservations and it was a Monday night so I was fairly sure the finding a table wouldn’t be a problem. When we arrived only three table were dining and place was at 10% capacity at best. We were to first to arrive and we told the host that we like to sit down and order some wine while we are waiting for our friends. We have been promptly told that we need to sit outside and wait until our full party arrives and until such time we won’t be permitted to sit down. Now, normally on a busy night, this would have been a reasonable request but on a night such as last one I considered this request to be unreasonable. After a brief argument with the host, we asked to see manager. She arrived promptly and repeated the “company policy”. Once we express our disappointment with the lack of initiative and flexibility on management site, manager simply said “I am just working here”. Well there can be a lot said about her response but suffice it to say, the owner didn’t do a good job neither empowering nor training his stuff. Just as we were deciding whether we should sit or leave and dine somewhere else the other couple arrived. At that moment the host, with a smirk on his face, told us “Now you can sit”. This was the tipping point. At that moment, I felt obligated to mention to the manager that this gentleman has no business working in service industry with such attitude and we left the place promptly and went to another restaurant. I think lack of initiative on management side, borderline rude host makes the food irrelevant and I won’t dare to expose myself and my friends to such an ordeal, so never again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Straightforward, well cooked food",50,28 September 2016,"Chose for a birthday celebration, knowing the entire family enjoys steak.Chose French Onion Soup to begin, which was delicious. Medium-rare steak very good, but more like a rare steak in Australia. The boys devoured. Great, morish French fries and for once, I didn't have to finish everyone else's. They ate them all.Desserts were all good, but not the standard of the steak frites.Quite pricey, but beef is expensive in Singapore.Good service. Will return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Classic steak et frites in a relaxing environment,40,8 September 2016,"The location of this restaurant is so relaxing which memories of old Singapore. The menu is pretty simple with steak et frites front and centre. And why not, for a once in while unhealthy meal with unlimited chips? House wines are good and the wine list boasts a few gems. Staff were friendly and attentive. Don't call to book a table - they don't answer their phone?! THe lemon sorbet with limoncello was a nice way to finish the meal."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Steak and Fries,40,3 September 2016,"I found a listing for E'ntrecote at Duxton Hill in the Singapore Good Food Guide, and decided to try it out. Quite a few bars and restaurants in the pedestrianised part of Duxton Hill. I live in Singapore but I wasn't aware of these fine restaurants until the other evening.Arrived by taxi and walked up the pedestrianised section until I reached the restaurant. Midweek and very few diners so got a table easily. Nice albeit narrow - we were seated near to the air conditioning. Ordered snails for starters - fantastic - full of garlic and most flavoursome. For the main event I ordered steak - it was medium well cooked, and came with French Fries - just as I ordered. Whilst I have nothing but praise for the food I was served, my colleague was less impressed with her order of mussels. The mussels were incredibly small - they were European and not the New Zealand version which are often served in restaurants. Had I ordered them I would have been unhappy too, so keep away from the mussels. For dessert I ordered cream caramel - again that was a wonderful choice.I called in advance to reserve a table and was told that it was not possible, however it is possible to reserve via the Trip Advisor app - which worked well. Free wifi, good service and nice ambiance. Certainly an enjoyably meal.Turn left outside the restaurant and walk down the hill through the car park and you will find a ready supply of taxis. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,AMAZING,50,14 July 2016,"This was simply amazing. Such a cool vibe, loved the food and had the best time with my boyfried here! Highly recommended. It's seriously a MUST in Singapore. Affordable and super tasty!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed with the steak & fries,20,20 June 2016,Six of us went for dinner at their branch in Suntec. The medium raw steak is so tough it was a struggle to chew. Not worth the price. Also the fries were skinny.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,bon appétit,40,17 June 2016,"Seriously this place has one of the best steak frites I have eaten, authentic and rustic. The wag you was great and the sauce was just right. It Coates well, my friends and I had the caramel lava cake after a heavy meal and thought so that it's the best in Singapore for a fondant or some call it a couldn't in one of those Michelin Starred Restaurant. We have enjoyed the food and great service.."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice people but food very poor,10,17 June 2016,"The food was very poor, low quantity and bad quality! People nice but in the end you need to eat properly right?"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice staff, but the food disappoints a bit",30,12 June 2016,"We had entrecote, the only main dish on offer, which is all you need, if you have a craving for steak frites. Unfortunately, it didn't measure up - at least not to our taste. The ambience is great, the staff is nice and attentive and the wine list was good. Perhaps worth a try for those reasons, but there are better places to found. PS for those who like chocolate, their mousse is really, really good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent service with housepour wines by the bottle,50,30 March 2016,It is definitely worth trying here if you're a fan of French wines. Tried their specialty steak with free-flow fries and it was amazing. Only issue is they don't accept reservations which is a bummer for organized people. Would definitely come back again.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Specialised,40,4 February 2016,By taking one dish and making it extraordinary L'entrecote excel in what they do. No pretence in trying to go beyond their specialty make their food divine.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,awesome streak,50,12 January 2016,"must order the famous streak, MEDIUM~ melts in your mouth~ reservation helps to reduce waiting time, good for couples and small groups!!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good but not great,30,19 December 2015,"ive had the mussels and ive had the steak here, having been to its counterpart in paris i was expecting something on the same level but was a little disappointed. The mussels were very nice and came with bottomless french fries, however the steak was a let down, it was tough and rather tasteless despite the sauce.The service on the other hand was very good and everyone was very friendly.I'd go back for the mussels but not the steak. I've rated it average but only because there wasn't a ""good"" but i wouldn't go so far as to say ""very good"". It was also kinda of expensive, for that kind of money i was expecting a better meal."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner,40,15 December 2015,"We were in singapore during my gf's birthday. so I was picking something that aren't too expensive but wasn't too bad. The steak was recommended on a random blog I came across and the photo looked really good. It was a steak with fries. The steak was amazing!! Although it didn't look too good in picture, but it was absolutely wonderful. Too bad we only ordered one because we wanted to try other food. So we ordered the mussles too, but it wasn't that good. We also had escargot but they forgot about it so our appetizer turned into our dessert. It was hard to find because we didn't know our ways, and it was located in a mall next to some superstore. Good to try, but probably not going to go again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Can do better,20,24 October 2015,"WellWhen the wine list is so limited and there is one aka 1 beer to select from there is trouble brewing especially when it's Stella !Food and service so so and the so called ""doneness"" varies it's always a challengeIf they sort the wine list and stock a few bottle beers there are possibilities !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple Steak and Chips...Perfect!!!!,40,13 October 2015,"A nice cosy restaurant with a section next door. Was very busy next door, and as we didn't have a reservation, staff were helpful to give us a small table near the bar.Food was very nice, and the highlight was the pate they had on the platter we had as an appetizer.Nice simple menu, steak and chips, or a fish option. I went for the steak, and did ask the what Entrecote steak was, but was unsure even after I was told. It was a striploin steak, and mine was perfectly cooked to medium. Nice and juicy. Although I do prefer to cut the steak myself, but it was served already cut, Wasn't a big deal as the steak was nice.A slight mix up with the orders of my other friends on the table, but were very accommodating and remade the orders, and even gave us a free round of drinks."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak!,40,13 September 2015,"The best steak in a long while, been here for the third time. Menu is straightforward and easy to understand, standard is consistent - always great service, memorable place. Lunch and dinner has the same quality service"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Hmmm......not quite there !,30,1 September 2015,Went to the restaurant with 3 other friends.Chose to have their Wagyu steak which is supposedly their highlight. The steak was just OK. The meat was not as tender as expected and I found my self unable to chew the meat to the end which was not a pleasant experience.I like the price and the history of the place and hence would be willing to give it another go before I finally make up my mind.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed at the Suntec Mall l'entrecote... No return visit planned,20,31 August 2015,"I visited Duxton hill in 2012, was ok... So decided to try out their new opening in Suntec mall. My for end booked on line as you can do for the Suntec Mall one. That was the only decent thing that went well.On arrival, took time to find our table, they only sold Stella beer... No other beer, they had run out of gin ( I don't like Stella, but I'm ok to drink other stuff). Tasted the red wine on house... It was dry and tasted of vinegar, went for the 99$ red ( was meant to be a treat ) ... Turned it just drinkable. My starter of snails was good... My for ends starter of duck roulette was fat with a bit of duck taste ... It should have had more duck taste. The steak was fine but the sauce was over bearing.. Almost drowned it. It just felt a poor experience. Oh - amd if you have a nut allergy, stay away. We asked if one salad could be without walnuts... They brought it with, then took it away, my fore d discovered on eating it all they had done was pick the walnuts off as he found 2 at the bottom of his sale dish. Good thing he just hates walnuts and it's not a life threatening problem. All 3 of us at this restaurant were really disappointed... By food, service, amd ambience. Telling us the reason the food is slow as there is a baby fare upstairs in the mall did not impress us either..... We could not see any connection. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Boring place,20,28 August 2015,"They just served entrecotte. It's not bad, but the last time i was there the price was higher, so I'm not coming back anymore."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty - Good Concept,30,12 August 2015,Tasty lunch - very tight seating. Steak was tough though. IF you wish a great steak meal - try another place before L'entrecote.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec outlet - avoid this place,20,25 July 2015,"This is my second visit as I was not impressed at all on my first. And again, service is slow, inattentive and staff seem disgruntled when handling customers (come on, no smile?) Service in this ""bistro-like"" establishment, with servers wearing shirt, vest and tie looks awkward with ""mahjong"" paper as table cloth. Frankly, if you are running it like a bistro, make sure your staff don't look atas, serve atas and talk atas (atas meaning proud) cos you are not fine dining...Waiting time for main course (with a half full restaurant) is 20-30mins. Frankly, I will not be back. No wonder pepperoni next door is always full (and with queue) and Entrecote is always half full. For the price I am paying for the entrees and main course, there are many places around here to dine. Avoid this place"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec - Food Good, Service A Disappointment",20,14 July 2015,"In spite of the negative comments on service we ate here as we wanted a ""beef fix"" and it was very convenient to our hotel. Steak was cooked perfectly, sauce excellent and the fries were well-prepared, almost perfectly salted. But the service? Our watiress didn't seem to know what service meant; when our daughter wanted a slight change to the pasta beneath her salmon she didn't know what to do and pushed-back to a a change at first, then commenting that it was odd (daughter wanted pasta tossed in garlic butter rather than a cream sauce). Never refilled empty water glasses, when plates were cleared I counted at least 22 times that she walked passed our table and never asked if we were interested in cofffee, dessert or the check. When I spoke with the hostess she tried to rectify by offereing free dessert (she comped corkage on our wine instead as we wanted to leave) but also seemed well-aware of the issue. The owners need ot address this. There are plantly of similar comnents, and the staff is impeding sales in a busy area where several hotels could feed service if the concierges were in a position to recomment the restaurant. I know I shared my experiece with the Conrad concierge."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Will be back for more,40,12 July 2015,"Went there for a date with my girlfriend, ambience was very nice, very private. Place was very classy. Went to the outlet at Suntec City. We had the l'entrecote steak & fries, Caesar salad & escargots. Steak was cooked to the right doneness for me, but a little too rare for my girlfriend, fries was good and when it was last order we requested for more fries, they served it freshly cooked. Awesome, great service from the staff as well, recommended to visit, but not a fan of the escargots there. They probably should serve some bread first as the steaks took quite awhile. Thank god we had appetizers."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money,40,1 July 2015,"Went with a group of all-girl friends to the Suntec outlet. The lady manager was very friendly and joked with us. Not packed on a weekday night, so at least it's not so noisy and stressful.Price was very reasonable, with mains at only S$20. Appetizers and desserts were also decently priced. Loved the salty caramel lava cake. And the half baked chocolate cake - not too sweet like most lava cakes.Only disappointment is the Foie Gras, which was a terrain instead of the pan-fried version."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Could be much better,20,24 June 2015,"Visited the outlet in Suntec (near the fountain) for lunch today. Opted for the steak and fries, which came with a salad as a starter. Food was bland and unappealing and the steak wasn't anything particularly special. The restaurant was only about half full at lunch time which perhaps should have been a bit of a sign of the quality to be expected. Total cost for 2 was about $50 which I guess was ok. Overall it could be much better and it's honestly hard to recommend."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food,50,7 June 2015,"They offer a lunch special for $20.95++ which is a starter, main course and a soft drink. I had the walnut salad and the steak and it was delicious.
I would certainly go back again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Food and Great Service,40,5 June 2015,"The restaurant has good vibes, waiters are polite and the food is delicious. they have their ""special"" sauce for the steaks which is really delicious and the size of the dishes is satisfying."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mediocre food,30,24 May 2015,"I had lunch here with a bunch of people. I found the food mediocre. Had the salmon steak dish. I found the salmon a little tasteless and the sauce lacking. Ambience was okay (went to the Suntec branch) and service was relatively alright. Underwhelming experience, wouldn't return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,very good athmosphere,50,23 May 2015,"located in a vibrant part of china town
packed on weekends, make a reservation.
typical french food, starters like patee or onion soup, main course only entrecote with fries and salad, excellent !!!!
nice deserts, wine etc.....
great experience, reasonable price"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant surprise,40,16 May 2015,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec City (Fountain area)**We found this place pretty much by accident as we were looking for a place for lunch after a fair at the Convention Centre.It was pretty busy so we figured it should be good. And it didn't disappoint.We had the lunch set (steak frites) and also a roast chicken main meal. The set was value for money as it came with salad, steak with fries, soft drink and a dessert of the day. Even though we only had a dessert, they were kind enough to let us share- giving us an extra set of cutlery without the need for asking. The prices are affordable and the food tasted good too, especially the fries! Service was quick, even though it was fairly busy - Friday lunch crowd.I would definitely go again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Decent Meat, Average Service",30,15 May 2015,"Certainly doesn't compare to L'entrecote in other countries, but it's the best Singapore has to offer. Not generous with 2nd servings, and they refused to let me take my leftovers home for my dog because they were scared of liability (food poisoning), even if it was for animal consumption. I even gave consent and accepted the consequences but they still wouldn't let me do a doggy bag. Not a happy customer, but if you're craving L'entrecote- go here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinner,10,12 May 2015,Food cold bland and not fresh. Not worth the money. Main course came before even 1/2 way through starter. Service way to quick
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French Farce !,10,29 April 2015,"Having eaten at entrecôte in Paris and london this place is a complete shambles. Whilst waiting for a steak meal it is customary in France to receive a bread basket. When one dos not appear we questioned this and the response came ""it's only given on request "" The green salad has an awful citric dressing unlike the beautiful creamy vinaigrette in France and london. Then came the steak with an inadequate sizzle of the famous house sauce. We asked for more and were told we would be charged 3 dollars for it. (Despite a bill of over 100 dollars for two )Then came the profiteroles. A usually delicious and indulgent dessert ... Again this came with a pitiful dribble of choclate sauce on it. Needless to say we did not ask for some more sauce this time ! The whole experience was soulless and petty. We felt we were part of their profit making mathematical sum. No passion. Just a mere business. If it hurst them so much to bring out the food, I suggest they put their mathematical skills in another line of business"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,value for money,40,30 March 2015,they use good meat and they do it well. prices are reasonable and service is great. will come back again.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for Money,40,23 March 2015,"Basically, for a really reasonable price, you can get a plate of salad, good quality steak with a pretty nice sauce and unlimited fries. Don't come here if you're looking for variety or a really fine dine experience. But it doesn't hurt to come here when you're craving steak while on a budget."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak Frites Supper,30,23 March 2015,"Nice location on Duxton Hill. This restaurant only serves Steak Frites for the main course and there is a choice of 2 sizes. The steak and chips were average, the salad was excellent as were the starters."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great eggs Benedict for breakfast,50,22 March 2015,"I discovered that L'entrecote just recently opened on its side, l'Annexe. And it serves a great Parisian breakfast. I chose the eggs benedict with salmon and it was a best bet. I highly recommend. Freshly backed croissant, tasty coffee, freshly squeesed orange juice. Beautiful pedestrian street, quiet. A perfect start for a sunday with family. Cheers. Vincent"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing,20,5 March 2015,"I had heard a lot about this place and on arrival in Singapore some work mates suggested we meet there. It started well with a kir on arrival and some delicious l'escargot but the steak was sinewy and covered in sauce. Way too rich especially when topped by a mountain of fries which, I am a sucker for, but made the whole thing unappetising. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and delicious,50,4 March 2015,"One of the popular places in Duxhill area. Menu is straight forward; steaks and fries, but very good!! Not enough? They will come with extra meat, without extra charge :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Sorely Disappointed, Waste of Money",20,22 February 2015,"I had high hopes for this restaurant as they have one entree of steak and fries I expected it to be excellent..it wasn't. The steak is from a cheap cut and the sauce they serve it with has an overpowering taste of lemon, it was terrible.Only good thing were the fries which unfortunaye they refuse to serve with ketchup which i would have forgiven them for if the steak sauce was at least tasty!I will definitely not be returning!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,From top to flop,20,17 February 2015,"It makes me sad to write this review as I was visiting l'entrecote since it opened. However, I realised that the quality got worse over time. My very last experience yesterday was quite special indeed. When I sat down at the table the guys on the table next to us warned us not to order as the food is terrible. Sounded like a very strong word to me so we decided to go ahead. I had bone marrow as a starter (as always), which was within my expectations. However, the salad was served at the same time, which was quite quite special (especially given the fact the the service was exceptional in the beginning). Later on when the entrecote was brought to the table I saw immediately that my rare is not rare but medium well as they meat is already carved. I tried a bite and realised no matter how this meat is cooked it wont be one of my enjoyable. I mentioned to the staff the overdone meat. She offered to get me a new serving, which I rejected due to the fact that it takes another 10 to 20 minutes and my friend already had his food. My disappointment was the fact that I was served carved meat. It's one look and the chef or the staff serving would have realised it's overcooked.Anyway, this was the first time in probably over 20 years (or possible ever) that i did not finish a steak. I felt very sad as I had quite a few good dinners with friends at l'entrecote and I knew the moment I walked out that i will not be back soon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Started so well, these days they are lost.",20,27 January 2015,"I have visited L'Entrecote the first day it opening and a number of times since. The 1st 6 months were great, good service, good food, absolutely no complaints. Then it all started going downhill.I visited sporadically over the last few years to see if they had improved but I am constantly disappointed. The service is bad, the servings are definitely not what they used to be. The food/sauce that made it famous has changed, cold servings .... all in all I will never return.So sad."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Service is SHOCKING,20,23 January 2015,"So having been ti the Duxton Hill restaurant and throughly enjoyed it we thought we would try the Suntec City outlet. OMG what a shocker. It was a Friday evening and we had made reservations for 18:30. The restaurant was pretty much empty at that time so we were shown to our table and ordered sparkling water at S$9++ per bottle. OK no worries. We then ordered a bottle of house red which came as a non descript wine that just said L'entrecote 2013 Bordeaux. No other information. We asked the waitress for more information about the wine...needless to say...CLUELESS!Anyway..main course. We ordered the large Steak Frites (S$39.90++). I ordered medium and my wife ordered well done. We were served the complimentary walnut salad with consisted of a plate of greens with 3 half walnuts on the side. When the main course arrived I was aghast to see my wife's steak was actually medium rare and mine was rare. We immediately called over the waiter and explained that the steak was not cooked as per our order. When we told him we ordered well done and medium he suggested we had ordered the wrong thing and that for medium we should have ordered well done and for well done we should have ordered extra well done. I was shocked. I laughed at his suggestion and told him we we're not eating this and that he should take it away and we want it cooking as we originally ordered...he took it away and 10 minutes later he returned with the exact sam plates and the steak had clearly been placed in a microwave oven, the steak was incredibly tough at this point. We spoke to the waiter once again and told him we were not happy with the meal. He then said he would ask the manager to come and speak with us....LOL!...The manager arrived...some young french girl who had clearly never even managed a greasy spoon cafe let alone managed a restaurant! She asked what was the problem and we explained the whole sorry saga again. She asked did we want a replacement to which we replied ""yes"". 23 minutes later we had a replacement meal. Mine was ok, however my wife was still cooked medium. At this point we thought f k it. We ate what we could and decided to pay and leave. At the checkout the manager (Estelle) gave us our bill (S$158) and never once asked us was every thing ok. I mentioned this to her and she said she didn't ask because her view was if we didn't complain again then everything must have been ok. Her arrogance was beyond belief. Even though the Duxton Hill experience was great, we will never go to either again because of the terrible service at Suntec City.BE AWARE!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TERRIBLE ARROGANT SERVICE"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Had bigger expectations of this steakhouse,30,11 January 2015,"I spent some time reviewing steak restaurants before settling upon L'Entrecote. The restaurant itself is a great little place, in Duxton Hill, and the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant was fabulous, quaint old lights, walls lined with bottles. Very atmospheric. The menu is simple but expected. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Regrettably the food however, was not quite up to expectations. The French onion soup was piping hot, and looked every inch like a tasty bowl of soup, but unfortunately there seemed to be very few onions and it was quite watery, definitely not what I was expecting. The steak came with the sauce poured all over it. I did not appreciate this, I had expected this to be in a separate jug so that I could pour. I did not enjoy the sauce but that is my taste I guess. The steak was quite tough and chewy and disappointing. Such a shame as the restaurant looked so promising. My usual test of a good restaurant is whether I would pay a return visit. In this instance I'm afraid not."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sadly dissapointed,20,7 January 2015,Cold plates with thinly sliced steak is always a bad start. Tough meat also. Over priced wine. Had the impression that the nice people working there had never tasted their own food. On a positive not the chips were good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good lunch set menu,30,2 January 2015,"I ate there with my wife and 4 year old child. We were there during lunch time within a festive week. It was quite easy getting a table. The whole place was pretty empty.Interestingly, the hostess seat us one table away from a couple having a meal and conversation. The whole place was empty and actually through out the meal I was a bit concerned about my son making noises and disturbing the couple. The hostess could have seated us better.The food is so-so. We ordered 3 entres. Only one of them the ""Duck Leg"" is delicious. We ordered Creme Brulee for desert and it doesn't taste nice at all.The overall environment is alright and the staff seems friendly and eager (although only two tables were occupied when we were there).I would come back again but only after I tried the other places nearby."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Super steak and frites,50,30 December 2014,"Midweek lunch
Attentive sevice.
Had set menu -glass of wine ;mixed leaves with walnuts in tasty dressing; fabulous steak, perfectly cooked medium rare in a tasty sauce.
Unlimited fries.
29$ good value.
Unfortunately drinks were very expensive.
But
We would definitely go again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L'Entrecote Suntec City - Not so French afterall,30,20 December 2014,"Have randomly chosen this restaurant as lunchtime crowd in Suntec was really busy then on a Saturday. This was one of the only few restaurants that did not look busy probably due to price since French food?? We were initially attracted by their lunch set meal - burger set. In the end, we ordered escargot as starters, main course : seabass and duck confit with rice. We like the seabass and their famous butter sauce the best. The duck confit was alright except can see visible fats from the thigh which can be a turn off. Escargot was bland. They were not generous with bread though. The coffee was terrible as a glass of wine is expensive. The restaurant is a fusion of French/American with loud music playing in the air. I can see mostly expats with mix of Asians and children are allowed in the restaurants probably due to the casual setting. The service staff looked busy and stress. The table like French setting but the whole room/atmosphere looks very casual. Dark with spotlights all over. The restaurant has potential but I think they can improve on their concept better."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Simple menu, simple food",40,13 December 2014,"The simplest menu I have ever seen, made choosing of the food much faster. We started of with the famous escargots, which I thought was delicious! The main course is just one in the menu, which is steak and fries. The steak was cooked to my liking, perfect medium rare and the fries were thin and crisp. We didnt get a dessert because we were too stuff! I will go back there again. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Frites,20,11 December 2014,"Went for an early dinner and it was fairly empty...so got a table easily. The restaurant filled up rapidly after that, so going early is best.Had an onion soup for starters and although the bread and gruyere topping was good, the soup easily was thin and on the salty side.Main course was of course steak and frites. My heart sank when I saw the steak drenched in the house ""secret"" sauce. A great steak is never dunked in sauce. I asked for the steak to be done medium rare, but it came close to medium. The steak beneath the sauce was stringy and had tendon. It was tender but lacked taste. And I couldn't make out the direction of the sauce.Dessert was their lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let's just say the highlight of the meal was the ice cream, not the cake and everything leading up to dessert.A very forgettable meal in the guise of a French bistro. The proprietor of this restaurant seriously needs to rethink the preparation of the food. But then it could just be me because the restaurant was full when I left."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Lovely sauce :-),40,9 December 2014,"Was lucky enough to be invited for lunch at this restaurant - the street where it is situated in Duxton Hill is nice and cosy, the restaurant looks authentic French and service was good.We had the Duck Foie Gras for starters and that was quite a big serve for lunch but ohh so tasty. When the steak came with its fries and salad and the sauce it was perfectly cooked and the taste was great. Although I couldn't actually eat desert I had to try the one with the icecream, the merinque and chocolate sauce - and that is also one which should be tried :-)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec L'Entrecote - What a shame....,10,30 November 2014,"In the kitchen of L'Entrecote is a man who can cook. Unfortunately, the person managing front of house has the organisational capability of a shaved monkey. It was so bad it was funny. Ordered a glass of champagne and some wine. Champagne was flat - clearly the bottle had been open for too long. we told them and asked for a replacement... answer: ""we've run out of champagne for the day"" ..? My pate and Fin's ceasar salad arrived. 15 mins later, H's soup ""was still being prepared"". We cancelled the soup and suggested our main courses come together. Mine arrived after 10 mins. No sign of the other two. 10 mins go by.... the 3 of us ate my very well cooked steak and chips and as we finished, the two burgers arrived. To make the experience worse. We tolerated service that would have caused a riot in a badly managed prison and watched two of the staff enjoying a leisurely lunch whilst the restaurant remained in chaos. Do not ever, ever, ever eat in the is restaurant until you read reviews confirming the manager has been taken in to the basement carpark of Suntec and put out of his misery."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Bad imitation of L'Entrecote,20,25 November 2014,"Lunched at the Suntec City branch. Rather pretentious maitre d', food is average, the sauce is not at all authentic, weird head-banging music playing too loudly. No .... won't be back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,I waited 30 mins for my steak!! Lousy service.,20,21 November 2014,I was at the Suntec branch on a friday evening. We were served our appetizer and had to wait 30mins!!! for our mains to arrive. The service was terrible due to they were full house and were shorthanded. The tables who arrived later than us were served their mains much earlier than us. They forgot about our orders. We had to keep asking them for our food. It was mad. I used to visit quite often but would like to avoid after this eventful day. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cheap is Cheap gets,10,20 October 2014,"Great location. Thats it! There is a saying in Singapore, trying to find value invariably leads to disappointment. This place fits that bill. Its also destroying the brand!Not sure any of the staff know a chateaubriand from their rump - or where France is! Sadly the manageress doesn't seem to care! Needs a pull through from the top down. Until then - AVOID!There is better value for money elsewhere in Duxton. Better aperitif, better food, better wine and certainly better service! Great food and service to be had at Latteria and La Maison Fatien."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not even close to the L'Entrecote standard,20,19 October 2014,"Unfortunately, my visit was kind of a disappointment. I have always enjoyed their sister restaurants in London, NY and Geneva but the standard at the Singapore restaurant isn't even close to it. First of all is the air conditioning not working properly so the temperature is uncomfortable. Tables are to narrow to each other and waitress acts like first day at work. The meat, fries and famous sauce is not even close to the standard. Avoid"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Keeping life simple,40,2 October 2014,"If it's a steak you want. Steak you'll get. Simple concept. Flat fee for steak (either small or large) it's the ONLY entree: with add-ons for appetisers and deserts. Lively venue, not too noisy, with a good ambience and decor. A smart set of diners. Worth a visit. Good value for business lunches; date night and groups of friends.Like the option of carafes for the wine; as you can switch between courses. Tres bon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak and fries,30,25 September 2014,"We dined at their Suntec City branch. This restaurant was recommended by a friend and we really came here just for the steak and fries, which didn't disappoint. It was not the best steak but was pretty good. It was cooked according to our preference and I was a big fan of the sauce.I also ordered a glass of their red wine (Bordeaux) which went perfectly with the steak. For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel lava cake which was also pretty good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good value steak,40,5 September 2014,"Very decent steak for the price. The strips are just the way they should be and you probably either love it or hate it, thin, content less and a little bit like chewing paper. The steak on the other hand was lean, without tendon but tasteful. Avoid the heavy sauce and just go for the steak and walnut salad."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Carnivore’s dream come true,40,30 August 2014,"As an avowed carnivore, L’Entrecôte is my idea of heaven- the only main course is steak! Not just any steak though, a mouth-watering entrecôte steak accompanied by a fresh green salad and refillable fries, at the end of the meal we were completely full. Although located in Duxton Hill, the atmosphere of L’Entrecôte reminded me of a Bistro I used to visit in Paris (tables very close to each other, waiters running around, plenty of glasses of wine on each table!) reflecting the authenticity of the restaurant."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak !!!,40,2 August 2014,"They only have 1 main course and for good reason ... Its perfect !
They have welcoming sparkling drinks and a good service .
The restaurant does not take reservations and its actually a good thing !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Didn't even step in and already a bad impression.,20,12 July 2014,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec **The only reason why I'm rating this restaurant as ""Poor"" and not ""Terrible"" is because I didn't even step foot into it, so I can't judge for the food or atmosphere. I rang up for a reservation on a Friday evening and I got a guy telling me that their reservations were full. Even before I could ask if I could walk in to try for a table, he said, ""OK. Bye."" and promptly hung up.I understand that Friday nights are busy but this was incredibly impolite. If the service is like that on the phone, I dread to think what it's like in the restaurant. I'm avoiding this place at all costs from here on."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French fast food restaurant,20,10 July 2014,"We dined at the Suntec city restaurant. It took them about 5 min to serve our food after the order was taken. Seems like the food were pre-cooked. We had the Onion soup which was lukewarm and bland, tasteless pasta salmon, think slice of steak which was not worth the price ($29.90) - was cooked medium well when we requested for medium rare, Escargots and Salad Nicois. It seems that they were in a hurry for us to finish our meal even thought there were only few diners. Before I could finish my soup, the salad was served. Service was really poor. And for a French restaurant, they do not even have a soup spoon. It was a bad dining experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok food. Horrible service. Terrible air conditioning,20,5 July 2014,"Food is ok. Thin slices of meat. However, the air conditioning is horrible. It was so hot that we had to move outside for dessert. Service is also bad as no one tended to us when we moved outside to get better air. We could have stood up and walked away. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good Food and Service,50,21 June 2014,"I can see a mix of good and bad reviews here. Firstly, I use the palate card that offers 50% discount when dining with one other. So that makes the meals here extremely reasonable. With regards to the water on offer, we always opt for the normal water as opposed to the still or sparkling options.I always order the steak and fries while my wife orders the chicken dish. Both are always good, we like the free flow of fries that come with the steak though you have to ask for it or they will not be refilled.Service is good and we always leave this place happy. Have yet to experience the bad service experienced by the other reviewers."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unethical.,10,15 June 2014,"One word summary: Unethical.Visited the suntec outlet on Father's day hoping to have a nice time with my wife and my parents. Food was ok, service was bad and I think what you guys are doing with the still water is plain unethical. $18++ for water that I didn't want is ridiculous. When I asked the cashier why I was being charged $18 for water, she said that's the price of their product. Yeah sure, I wasn't given a choice for any other option. I was asked ""sparking or still""? You even opened a 2nd bottle without asking. Cost wasn't made known either. It should be made known that there is also an option of ""ice water"". You may defend and say we didn't ask. Sure, you make my $18 now but no matter how good your food is, and it really isn't, I'm never going back again. Neither are my friends. Ask yourself if it's worth it, since you're pretty new to Suntec. No wonder you changed FB page when your previous FB page has so many 1 star reviews. You may say other restaurants do this too, unfortunately you don't command the status, neither is your steak Wolfgang Puck quality, your price isn't $650, so don't try charging lay people who just wanna have a $20+ father's day dinner $18 for water. Feel free to explain your style of management and bad service.PS. Your ""still"" water contains high amounts of sulphate and doesn't even taste that great."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not my idea of a good steak but may appeal to others,30,12 June 2014,"My French colleagues told me they quite liked this place so I went ahead and organised a group dinner there. As we were in great company with overseas visitors and old friends, we were able to have a good evening despite the shortcomings. I in particular (and a young visitor from Bangladesh who has been to France) did not quite appreciate the steak, neither the sauce. I heard some reviewers say that the steak was huge but mine was small, thin (cut in six slices) and bland on its own. I asked for the sauce to be served separately as I was told it has a rich sourish taste and did not want it drowning my steak in case I did not like it. True enough, it was too sourish (like yogurt sour) and very rich (probably a lot of butter). The French in our group were quite happy with the steak although only 2 (out of the 7 in the group) were offered second helpings. And we were not offered additional fries until most of us were quite done with our meals and the ones who wanted had to ask after more than 15 minutes into the meal. The 2 waitresses were very sombre looking and just did their work robotically with no warmth and no smile. The 2 waiters were a bit better, more trying to be efficient than being friendly. The desserts were good especially the Salty Butter Caramel Lava Cake although it was too sweet. The profiteroles were a tad dry probably from being in the fridge? The cost of the appetisers and the desserts were equivalent to those in hgher-end restaurants so in the end the bill still did amount to quite a lot. I guess on my part, this is not how I like to eat steak. Perhaps one needs to first appreciate and really like the sauce and opt to have the steak rare or medium so that the taste of the sauce is absorbed by the meat. Otherwise, this is not the place for you as there is only one main course option. And this restaurant advocates a 'no reservation policy' and they also will not give you a table until your whole group is present (or at least most of them)."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not like the original,30,7 June 2014,"I went there with my friends expecting the same experience as we had at L'Entrecote in France and the UK but got disappointed. The classic dish was made different here. Salad had a simple vinaigrette sauce with whole walnuts thrown on top instead of the creamy/ Caesar dressing w cut walnuts mixed together. The meat was ok but the sauce was very different. This defeats the purpose of this style of restaurant where you expect consistent quality and taste in any outlet across the world. Ah, and as other people already said, service is just about average. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Let us finish the starter before serving the main course !,20,1 June 2014,"Having frequented the Relais de Venise in Paris, I was excited to try L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill in Singapore. Despite having to queue at any time of the night and any day of the week, the Parisian restaurant never failed to deliver in terms of food, service, ambiance and overall experience. Clearly I was expecting too much from the establishment in Duxton Hill.The online menu boasts 'an unlimited supply of crisp, golden French fries complimented by our hand selected L’Entrecôte red wine'. Perfect. I ordered the Entrecôte steak with its legendary sauce, golden French fries and walnut salad, and a carafe of the L’Entrecôte house red wine. The waitress apologised that they had run out of the house wine and invited me to make another selection. Surprised, I asked her to please check and she returned 5 minutes later with a carafe of what I assume was the house wine.The walnut salad arrived but was very uninspiring. Nevertheless I was half way through eating it when the waitress arrived with my steak. Without saying a word she picked up my salad as I was eating and moved it the other side of the table and plonked the steak down in front of me, and then swiftly left. 'But, but,...'. The steak was good, the sauce was good. It was only 10 minutes after I had finished my meal that the waitress asked if I wanted more fries. I informed her that I had already finished my meal 10 minutes ago. She walked off.Later she returned and asked if I had finished with my salad. I informed her that I was still eating it when she brought the main course. She walked off.Meanwhile, a young couple had arrived and were enjoying their walnut salad at the table opposite me. They were newly dating and engrossed in each other's company, only picking at their meal between animated conversations. Keen to learn whether my experience was an unfortunate one-off or common practice for this restaurant, I stayed to observe.Sure enough, before they had finished their salad the main course arrived and their salad plates relocated. I noticed a mild look of astonishment on their faces, but they were in love and nothing was going to spoil that.By this time the restaurant was half full, and rather sterile with no ambiance whatsoever, and certainly with no need to rush the customers through. I declined the desert on principle and promptly left with no intention of returning."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore,40,16 May 2014,"Have eaten here 3 times. Love love the steak and fries. Not the best steak I've ever had but still very tasty. Portions are huge especially after they come with seconds. Love the buzz, ambience and décor of this restaurant. It is ideal for a group of friends to meet up for a weekend dinner. Wouldn't recommend for a couple as the tables are very very close together so lack of privacy."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,C'est une expérience fantastique,50,11 May 2014,"Dined at the suntec outlet on the eve of Mother's Day - it was such a wonderful experience. The food was awesome - we ordered the steak & duck confit as main - both are very good especially the steak - the sauce is so unique, the meat is so good. As for the appetizer - don't miss the pâte - it was so smooth - it just melt in your mouth, it goes so well with the bread. Dessert is heavenly - chocolate lava, profiteroles, and vanilla ice cream - are so amazing. The suntec outlet also has a really nice bistro feel....feel like I'm in Paris :)) service is excellent too. I'll certainly return :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,french steak,40,29 April 2014,gave my bestie a birthday treat there and the steak and truffle fries were pretty tasty. the guy who served us was nice and attentive. Changed my seat to a better seats when available. Will return since is in town. I was at the pacific plaza branch.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec Outlet - Good Food, Service ruins Experience",30,21 April 2014,"Just came back from a meal at the Suntec Outlet, didn't quite feel like it was money well spent due to the service.The food was good. Had the escargot, mussels, beef tartare, duck confit and the steak frites. They were all done well. The escargot was flavoursome, mussels were cooked just right, duck leg was falling off the bone, steak done just right. I don't see why there is a need to have excessive mounds of fries on just about every dish. Looking around, I didn't see many polished plates because of the sheer amount given.The service was sorely lacking. It started out okay, water was promptly served. However we had to get them to bring more menus for my family who arrived after me and had been seated for over 10mins. They have this thing where they write your order on the paper table covers. We were told that this was so when the dishes arrived, the servers know where each dish went at the table without having to ask who ordered it. It didn't matter anyway, we were still asked.We wanted mussels to share as a starter (it's listed as a main). After confirming twice, my escargot arrived without the mussels. We were asked a couple of times if we had been served, which was nice but nothing came back from it. And we had to call for attention to ask about it a few times more. Half hour later, they came. It was all down hill from here. Forget that we poured our own wine, and water was rarely topped up. It seemed like the wait staff and kitchen staff do what they like and not what is requested. After a while of trying to get the wait staff over and to ask for water, she preferred to start clearing our table first instead. Clearing and serving opposite the seated person at the table isn't quite nice, conversations were interrupted quite a bit because of it.We were never asked how our meal was, and the icing on the cake? We finished our meal just after 9pm, i asked for the bill from the staff topping up water in our glasses, which went ignored, then I failed at at getting anyone's attention.. They were busy setting up the tables for the next day and shutting down. I looked over at the bar, I see the manager on his laptop looking at facebook. Gave up and decided to go to the counter to make payment. Nevermind the lack of serivce attention, but Facebooking when you still have guests in? Pretty bad if you ask me.I'd be cautious about going because of the service, which isn't good when the place was about 75% full (at this time could be forgiven), but it gets worse when it's pretty empty."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is ok but not for something else,30,15 April 2014,"I have a dinner at L'Entrecote today.I ordered medium rare and agree that their streak is good. But the bad part is their appetiser and desert. I had leek and vinaigrette. It was good if I went to some friend who might be just start cooking. The leek was very hard and sticky, not anywhere near tender. The vinaigrette was added with chopped shallots. Too sour and not tasty. The desert I ordered lava cake which was put on the menu is desert of the house. The cake is almost like rubber and inside lava have a rock solid of un-melted caramel. Service is average.Unimpressed !All-in-all. Steak is good but don't think about something else."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,way over rated,10,3 April 2014,"i was here to celebrate my birthday but the experience was not a celebratory one. The service was sloppy where the waiter served my dish by dropping it instead of placing it in front of me and he did the same over my shoulder across to my friends and had to ask several times before getting our water glass refilled.I had onion soup as starter and it tasted really blend. When i asked the waiter about it, his reply was that many customers did feedback that it's watery but that's the 'style' of their soup and that is why they placed salt and pepper on the table for us to season it ourselves.Their singular main course which is steak was tender and portion was generous but it tasted blend and I had to depend on their 'winning formula secret sauce' for flavour, which is sourish."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food & great service,40,30 March 2014,"As the one we know for years at Rue du Débarcadère in Paris, we found in Singapore the good traditional French food in a friendly ambiance. We enjoyed its traditional one meal which is steak with french fries. The paté de Campagne and the rillettes de canard have to be tried as well as the tarte Tatin and the île flottante."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A real let down,10,17 March 2014,"Went with great expectations, however food can be described as poor at best. Worst steak i have ever eaten, undercooked and tasteless. The sauce was so overpowering i thought i was eating lemon curd. The bill was 130 sing and money not well spent. A great shame as on our door step and grossly overrated!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Can not understand the hype about it!,10,26 February 2014,"I arrived alone in the evening around 8pm, got a table pretty quick.Did not like it though as it was of course under a aircon duct, but no other choice so I accepted.Then the waiting started... tables around me started to get filled and orders were taken.I was left aside, after 10 minutes they took my order too. Staff is very very unprofessional and my waiter had missing teeth... eeeehhh? Please who hired him to serve in a restaurant... OMG.I ordered the large entrecôte, medium. Arrived after 15 minutes. Fries were almost cold and the meat only a little warmer.Did not want to complain as I was hungry. The meat was ok but thats it. Fries as well...Sauce, whats the hype about this sauce? Every house made béarnese sauce is better. The house wine at 10 SGD is a rip off, well okay as wine in Singapore in general. Asked for the check and got more money back than supposed to.Okay I accepted with a smile and went away. The cashier takes the total amount of the bottom, which is the total of the bill... The due change is somehow in the middle. Hope thats not their rule otherwise the owners will not be happy.Would I recommend? Well if you like a fast food steak yes, if you like quality no.Its comparable to the lousy steaks of Outback in Singapore. Anyways what happened to Outback? They were top dollar some years ago..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Best value steak in Singapore,50,11 February 2014,"We've been to the Duxton branch twice now and if steak frites is your thing it's well worth it. As the name implies, there's only one main course, entrecote either a large or very large portion with ""free flow"" fries and a green salad. On both occasions the steak has been cooked exactly as we all liked it and service is polite and attentive.There's a good choice of French starters and desserts. We've enjoyed the starters, I've gone for the snails both times, such that he staff remembered the second time. We've never got as far as the desserts. Wine choice is good though we've only ever had the house red and white, which has been good value.The bistro decor all adds up to the Parisien feel, even if we are 6,000 miles away. Well worth it compared to some much more expensive options."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good burger, so-so steak",30,22 December 2013,"It was either this, or Wendy's. Loved the fries, steak was not that great, burger was juicy. Will probably come again, if Wendy's was the other choice."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A nice change,40,3 December 2013,Dinner here was a nice change from the Asian dining I had been doing for a few weeks. The steak was tender though a bit drowned in sauce. A complimentary glass of Kir was a nice start. The staff offered more fries. Meal comes with a green salad.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nothing special,30,12 November 2013,"Just what they say, entrecotte and fries. Not specially good, neither bad. Service is better than food, what is actually strange in Singapore.
Only go if you really need to eat a steak and don't know any other better place... But there is a lot."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great steak and seconds too,50,1 November 2013,"Reading other reviews there must be more than one L'entrecote in Singapore. This is the one just off Duxton Road. Went with 3 others. You cannot book, but midweek there was no queue. We had the speciality of the house - which everyone else seemed to be having. Excellent rare, succulent steak, delicious bearnaise sauce and great chips. The best bit was, just as you thought you had eaten it all, they refilled your plate! Great house red at a reasonable price too. Fantastic."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,You better like steak!,30,3 October 2013,"Service was good, steak was as expected, fries were amazing!
Bit too cozy with tight table seating but I'll take that over having to wait longer"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pretty disappointing lunch experience,20,3 October 2013,"Went during lunch-time, it was one of the few places in the Suntec dining hall with no line for entry.We lingered at the front for a short while before a waiter finally paid attention to us and then pointed us towards an assortment of available tables.It then took them a very long time to come and take our order, and we were not served water without asking.The place tries to have an image of being posh but seemingly doesn't know if it is a restaurant or more of a cafe.We ordered the lunch special burger ($14.95++). Food arrived in a timely fashion and mine was not bad, but my colleague's was well under done. When we asked them to re-do it, the waitress tried to claim it was medium, when it was obviously rare. (we also weren't asked what temperature we wanted the burgers cooked to).The re-did the burger and it was fine afterwards.The cheque came quickly!Overall a pretty disappointing and drawn out experience. the food was fine, but really unless the meat is some A-Grade I was not aware of, you couldn't had a more fulfilling experience at McDonald's"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So disappointing!,20,21 September 2013,"Really loved this place on previous visits. This time was such a let down. Firstly, they rushed us so that it felt as though we were in MacDonalds. We had barely sat down before we were hassled to order, and then the main course turned up before we had even started our salad. Clearly just wanted us out so they could get the next bill-payers in our seats! The steak was not great - which is supposed to be their selling point. Th house wine, which was pretty good and robust last time, has been changed and felt like a $50 rip off. Has the place changed management? Need to concentrate on quality rather than bums on seats or whill soon lose their reputation and customers. Sad!!!!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Place ok,30,12 September 2013,"Do not go L'Entrecote if you expect to eat a top quality meat.The starters they have are relatively good, we had the foie gras et pate de campagne.But what to say about the main course.Not the beef you would expect to get in a french restaurant.In addition to that the service is not the most friendly you could find."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Terrible steak given its the only main meal,20,10 September 2013,My steak was tough as old leather. Really quite amazed this place can stay in business given this is the ONLY main. Entrée was great but wont be visiting again. Seating very crampe. d
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible,10,9 September 2013,"Horrible food as I would like to say. The meat on the steak was very hard to chew on and it was quiet hard to swallow as well. I have been to l'entrecote in paris and it was very different from what i expected to have in singapore. I was very disappointed as the steak was too overcooked and the meat that was supposed to be juicy has lost all the juiciness. There was also lack of sauce that accompanied the hard meat steak and when i asked for more sauce,they would like to charge SGD5 just for the sauce. I wouldn't recommend to dine there although i saw many more of the menus. The main attraction of the course as in the paris is the steak and fries with the special sauce but nothing was special as it was in singapore. Very disappointed"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good restaurant: Does what it says on the tin!,40,4 September 2013,"We arrived without booking and were asked to wait a few minutes outside with a drink while they got a table ready. The place is is a nice area and has local charm. I can't say that the lady Maitre D' (Maitresse D'?) was effusive with her welcome but my goodness, she was briskly efficient and the serving team were well drilled. Once seated, we had our order taken immediately - not hard, they do steak and frites only - and there was a glass of wine in my hand within seconds. Just what I needed. The food arrived very quickly: The meat was perfectly cooked, flavoursome and tender too, the sauce rich without being overpowering and the fries were not over-salted. The portions were generous; I couldn't eat all of the meal. Good value for money. Very happy indeed and would return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Starting from the start...,20,13 August 2013,"Starting from the start.. We called to make a reservation but apparently they did not accept any, so we got there early to try to get a table. Sat outside for over 45min with little to no update from staff. Placed our orders and very specifically asked that for the steak sauce be served on the side to which the wait staff noted and affirmed. I ordered the Homemade duck foie gras terrine.. my bad for not asking what terrine meant (I was expecting the pan friend type). All the same, it was average at best. Free flow of fries as advertised.. nothing to complain about there. Great if you like your carbs. The steak was a different story. The Steaks:The quality of the steak itself was just a little better than the stuff u get at foodcourts. Tad larger but if you are the kind of person that really savours your cow, you will know that true quality wasn't even average.Next, the website advertised 2 servings of steak. Naturally we were expecting a second portion to come at some point only to be told that they had put the equivalent of both portions on our 1 serve - 200g topS! . SERIOUSLY?! Why would you advertise 2 servings, a) serve our ""2 portions"" in a single serving, b) that was really less than the size of one standard portion anywhere in the world, c) without our asking, d) shrug us off when we ask, e) then go ahead to the next door table to provide their second serving??! why?The plus side imo is the sauce. It is a pretty tasty sauce that the steak is apparently cooked in. I must say that I suspect it plays a major part in the other good impressions of this place because it completely masks the actual meat quality. Oh but wait... didn't we ask for sauce on the side?!So heres the thing, my sister is gluton intolerant (just shy of Celiac disease). So here came the steaks all soaked in sauce right? When we raised the point that we had requested all sauce to be served on the side, guess what, the gave her a portion with the sauce just flicked or wiped off. Naturally we called the lady manager again who flicked us off again and just said ""its not our policy to serve with sauce on the side"". Seriously?! policy? firstly your staff should not have acknowledged and accepted our request if it wasn't policy. Fine staff will be staff. You most certainly should not have just wiped off the sauce and served it all the same. Yes YOU because you were solely responsible for distributing the meats from the platter that came out of the kitchen. Also, saying 'not our policy' and trying to walk off before a customer can respond is completely unacceptable. I accept your subsequent apology after nailing your bottom to the floor as to whether you or your restaurant would bear the medical consequence of a gluten caused reaction by my sister. I guess its hard to worm you way out of it when public liability is involved. The starters aren't too bad relative to price relative terms. Think of this place as budget french dining with budget staff, fantastic sauce and lousy cow. Oh ya.. and cramped.. very tight space. Please tell me if you disagree... we'll have our doctors assist you with your query."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Top notch French food in Singapore,50,26 June 2013,"Excellent choice if you are tired of the local fare. One item on the menu, steak and their secret sauce, unlimited french fries"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,More about the service,10,20 June 2013,"This review is more about the service here than about the food because I'm still waiting for my steak to arrive and it's been more than a 20 minutes since we were finally given our cold appetizers. Probably a one off experience here but thought it worth sharing. We were initially moved to a different table after being seated for about five minutes so they could make space for a larger party. Then after orders were taken have been promptly forgotten by the wait staff, three other tables that arrived after us were served full meals while we weren't even given bread and now I guess they have forgotten about our meal because steaks still aren't here while other tables have been served! Frustrating!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak & Fries; that's it,40,26 May 2013,"This is a steak and fries resto and they offer nothing else. So you must like steak to come here. The staff, most especially the Westerners, can get snooty. They do not accept reservations except for big groups. We once booked a big table for 10 and they wouldn't let us sit down, even if they already reserved our table for us. We were about 6 already and the snooty Westerner waiter wouldn't let us sit. What's the point??? They already reserved our table and our companions were 10 minutes away. Plus we were celebrating 3 birthdays. They could be more flexible and service oriented in this sense. But I doubt they would care, because a lot of people go there. But there are better places to go to in the area, so they'd better improve.In addition, the place is TINY, and the tables are sooo close to each other so you really have no privacy. In fact, it's sooo cramped that they have to pull out the table to let you sit on the cushioned seats near the wall. Yes, that small."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Fries Bistro,40,22 May 2013,"You get what the name says - steak and fries and it's a bistro not a 5 star restaurant. So, if you are looking for something simple yet tasty, this place is worth your time and money. I've been here twice with my husband and would definitely come back whenever we feel like 'steak and fries' The serving size is good and the sauce they put on the steak is very yummy. If you finish your fries, they'll stock it up again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Honest food at good value,30,16 May 2013,"We liked the food, french brasserie style, at a good price. It is not fancy or exquisite, but it is honest and comfortable"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Great steak, fun experience",50,10 April 2013,"Really love steak so the concept of this restaurant really appealed to me. The starters and desert list were great too and the choice was a lot wider. Nice house wine and great atmosphere in restaurant. Wouldn't recommend if you don't like sitting close to other people, but I didn't find it a problem because everyone is chatting away so not the kind of place people are listening into your conversations."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Don't waste your money,10,22 March 2013,"My wife and I ate at L'entrecote recently, and quite honestly it was the worst food I've had in Singapore, and indeed possibly anywhere in recent memory. My wife ordered some foie gras terrine to start, and upon arrival noted that it was 'wet' - it certainly looked very unappealing to me. She was able to eat maybe two knifefuls on the toast, but had to give up after that. The texture was terrible and the foie had not been properly prepared at all.The only main dish available is the supposedly famous entrecote with the special sauce and frites. The meat simply didn't taste of anything resembling beef. It was absolutely dreadful quality meat. There isn't really anything else to say about that. The supposedly golden crisp frites were mass catering frozen chips that bore virtually no resemblence to the frites you might expect in Paris (or virtually any other city). The entire dish was totally unappealing and devoid of any decent flavour.The service was good and pleasant enough, and the wine was drinkable (just), but I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am familiar with the 'L'entrecote' concept from Paris and London, and it is good, but if you are only really serving one thing, you have to do it really well, and this restaurant fails in every respect on that front. Even their story about the origins of the concept on their web page is wrong."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Easy menu,50,11 March 2013,The l'entrecote in Singapore is a good place when you like steak and frites. The Restaurant is in good location and easy to reach. Might be busy during weekends as they do not take reservations.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple But good,40,10 March 2013,"If you like steak frites, then this is a must try. Gets rather busy quite early so try to get down early to snag a table (no reservations). Ambience is nice, decor has a french feel to it and the service was efficient with attentive staff. "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and great - a gem in the heart of Singapore,40,6 January 2013,"My wife and I were able to take a night out leaving the kids with the family during our trip though Singapore from Bangalore. We were looking for a classic, simple no fuss restaurant and loved the atmosphere at L'Entrecote. Service was quick and friendly but not intrusive, the food was perfect and a nice but small wine list. A little gem in the heart of Singapore."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Little Piece of Paris in Singapore,40,5 November 2012,"L'Entrecote Singapore provides an almost-perfect version of Parisian entrecote - right down to the great vibe, crowded seating, single choice of main course (and house Burgundy), free-flowing fries - and excellent entrecote and sauce. The coffee is good, the deserts excellent. The only thing lacking is visible, strong management. The staff are mostly efficient, but not perfect. A bit of training - and a personable, highly-visible, hands-on, experienced manager with a Parisian accent would turn this place from four stars into five.Note: If you've not tried entrecote before, don't go here expecting a range of main courses. The steak is why you go here. If you want a greater range, there are other places that do this - if you want steak frites with a great sauce, and only that, come here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing,20,30 October 2012,"Went for dinner anticipating a good meal. The appetisers, salad and desserts were up to their usual standards. The servers, whilst friendly enough, hurried us through our meal and attempted to clear plates even though we had clearly not finished. Couldn't understand what the rush was as the restaurant was not full. The meat was the great disappointment. It was a piece of mystery beef that looked and tasted more like a flank steak. Whilst it was well cooked, it was not what the restaurant advertises - an 'entrecote'. We had been to this restaurant many times before and were served the 'correct' cut but not this time. Disappointed."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,First time visit to Singapore's L'entrecote,40,15 October 2012,"We have visited L'entrecote in Geneva several times, and it one of our favourite places to eat when we are there. However, as we are now living in Singapore we decided to go to the newly opened Singaporean version, and compare. Our first impressions were good as we were met at the door by a friendly staff member, most Singaporeans are friendly though, and he guided us to a table. All the tables, at both Geneva and Singapore, are very close together, so be warned if you are expecting the usual space between you and the next table. The service is very swift, at both places, and our 'waitress' came to our table very quickly to take our order. We asked that the food not be brought out until we had finished our aperitif, but they brought it out too soon, before we had got half way through our drinks, so we sent it back, and they apologised. The wine selection is excellent and we enjoyed an enjoyable Australian vintage--but then we are fans of Australian wine, so are unashamedly biased. The food is very good as the steaks were cooked as we asked, and the sauce for the steaks (that's all you can order) was as good as that at Geneva. However, in Singapore they don't give you a fresh plate when you've finished the first steak and chips, as they do in Geneva, and we prefer the Geneva way--yes, you have two portions of both anyway, so go hungry.The staff are great here, we had fun, and they are much more friendly than in Geneva, where you really have to work at communicating with the staff.The bill was very reasonable for what we had. So, which did we prefer, Geneva or Singapore? Well, without a doubt, it has to be Singapore, as we had a great evening there. So, will we be going back? Yes, definitely."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Comfort food!,40,16 September 2012,"L'Entrecote is located at the increasingly trendy Duxton Hill area. I frequent this French bistro about once a month as it is consistently good. There is only one main course to speak of (steak & french fries) but a variety of excellent starters (and desserts) to choose from. They don't take reservations (which I think is good) and the idea is to stop by for a quick meal to satisfy your steak & fries craving rather than a long drawn-out 4 course meal. You get the feeling that they want to turn tables quickly (which is fair enough). The service is good nevertheless.Last night we started with a bottle of their house red - a generic Bordeaux that carries the L'Entrecote label. We were sitting in the outside area watching the place fill-up (it's been full every time I've visited). We were a little disappointed by the wine: under-ripe, unoaked red with too much Merlot probably. But for $49 you can't really complain.We moved inside and moved onto a lovely 2010 Cotes du Rhone which at $99 was still excellent value I think. One criticism I do have of the place is the rather small servings - I either have to order 2 starters (plus the main) or a starter and 2 mains (!). I can highly recommend the roasted bone marrow on toast with sea salt - the best I've tasted in Singapore! The escargots are similarly very good.As for the 'plat du jour', the beef is juicy and tender and cooked to your preference ('bleu' for me) but the frites are rather mediocre and could be much better.In summary, a lovely place and I look forward to going back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Second time around and just as good,40,11 September 2012,"We like the Duxton Hill area of Singapore and L'Entrcote is a great spot for a meal - as long as you like steak and fries! The restaurant does tend to have the tables close together, but both times we were the it was 50% full and perfectly fine. Nice touch is that salad comes first as a starter and there is a second portion of steak coming your way too."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Duxton Hill French Bistro,40,9 August 2012,"We enjoyed a recent trip to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill after a recommendation by a friend who had just returned from Singapore. Cute little renovated bistro very reminiscent of Fance Soir in Melbourne and thousands of actual bistros in France. We all decided on the signature salad, steak and fries. Green salad came first and was followed by a plate two thirds covered with French Fries. The steak was perfectly cooked to order and came already sliced into strips with the very tasty rich sauce. Tables quite close together in the French style so could not help but hear and notice Irish fellow next to us making a ""chip butty"" with his fries and bread roll. Wine list was quite good with many price points. We shared two desserts of chocolate fondant cake and tarte tatin. Both great tasting, but the tarte was a base of thick cake, not pastry, but perhaps this is a method that lasts longer in the heat and humidity of Singapore. All in all a fun night."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Went there for dad's bday,30,11 October 2018,Food portion is satisfactory however their service so-so. I put under remarks for celebration but there isn't any free cake to show appreciation of us celebrating at their restaurant. (I guess they are used to serve ah mao then local)
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,An ok meal made worse by below average service,30,13 August 2018,"I gave Les Bouchons a few chances because I wanted to like it. Food has been ok overall but I wouldn't choose to go there again. The first time I went my partner and my steaks were significantly under cooked, second time my friends steak was so fatty he couldn't eat more than half of it, last time they were fine. I'd actually be ok with the food if it was decent service. I've heard great things about the Ann Siang outlet but this one is appalling. I can't say any of the times I've been I've had any of the waiters show the remotest interest in being there or even be remotely friendly. One time we were the only person in the restaurant and I had to go inside for every step to find the waiter who was playing games on their phone. He literally seated us and went inside and left us to go play games without even pouring water."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good steak!,40,11 August 2018,"I went here many times and also another restaurant on Club street, every time I ordered a ribeye steak. Last night it was a bit too fatty but it was tasty as usual. Most of the times their steaks and chips were very good and I liked the side salad too. Very reasonable price for food and wine, staff were efficient."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good portions ,30,11 July 2018,"Myself and my husband called in here last night for a steak and the portion was massive, front of house wasn’t the best felt like they didn’t need our custom but Tom he food was good and very big portion. I did ask for a medium steak but it was more rare for my liking. I would advise well done if you don’t like it dripping in blood "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great place for dinner!,50,10 April 2018,"The steak is great! Nice place for dinner, very clean, the food was great, and the atmosphere was very nice. Great place to eat and spend few hours at night."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good meal in very pleasant surroundings,40,1 April 2018,"Visited here with my wife - I had a sirloin steak and she had the duck, both of us were surprised at the size of our meat helpings - more than my wife was able to eat! The meat was cooked to our preference whilst the cook cam to check that my wife's duck was cooked the way she liked it. We had a salad included with our meals which was tasty and 'free flowing chips' we both already had more than enough with our order. The staff were friendly throughout he evening and we wold certainly return here."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sorry Les Bouchons,20,25 March 2018,Sorry my friends. You lost your magic. Once an excellent place for steaks in a nice atmosphere by the river. So what has changed ? Service ! Or lack of service. I was there on a weekday for a casual business dinner. Plenty of staff but we had to call for attention several times. Very inexperienced waiters. Good wine list with fair pricing (for Singapore standard) restaurant was 20% full when we visited. Please work on your training program and I’ll be back. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Regrets,10,2 March 2018,"Ordered the cote de beuf for 3 person but sharing for 2 they said no free flow of fries. Look at the price come on it was just fries, we were just tourist trying your food, we even ordered dessert don’t understand why we cannot have free flow of fries. Was served by a pleasant looking lady we had indoor and she was crying that I had to offer a tissue, guess it is really not a nice place there. That all I can say is employees first then they will treat your customers right. Overall we regretted dining there though the lady was nice."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best supper during my stay in Singapore,50,1 March 2018,"I made an online reservation prior to my visit to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday in Singapore. We ordered the Giant “Cote de Boeuf” (Prime Rib) 1Kg, one of the ""specials of the house,"" which came with a bowl of salad, bread, and free flow of french fries. The prime rib cooked medium both looked and tasted so good we couldn't stop eating! At the end of the meal, we ordered a chocolate cake, which came on a nicely decorated plate with a message ""happy birthday"" (I asked them if they could do a little surprise on our dessert plate through email when I made the reservation!). The staffs were friendly and generous throughout our stay and undoubtedly nice enough to celebrate and take pictures of us for my boyfriend's birthday. They definitely succeeded at making us walk out of the restaurant with our stomachs full, hearts warm, and lots of smiles! Access is also great as it's located along the river, so you can take a nice 15-minute walk to Clark Quay station. Again, thank you so much for everything. Will definitely come back again (from Japan!):)"

We loved the onion soup; the meat and french fries were OK.
But average service and a bit over priced."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Superb duck ,50,21 February 2018,"This was my last night of a ten week bounce around Asia. I decided to treat myself to a meal here. I passed it, looked at the menu and thought ""Why not?""Good decision. After being well welcomed, I decided to go for the duck and ordered a bottle of red bojo (chilled, perfect)The chef came out to chat and how specifically I wanted my duck cooked. Nice touch and shows a good sense of precision and service.It arrived absolutely spot on. Delicious. And with the most perfect fries, à volonté, everyone's a winner.Lovely food, lovely wine and great service. I couldn't finish a whole bottle of bojo so sent a glass in to the chef to say thanks. Hope he enjoyed it. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great Value Steak & Fries,40,19 February 2018,"Not the biggest menu but when steak is this good, it doesn't need to be... The fillet steak is excellent, comes with a decent salad and free flow fries, what's not to like..."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nice French food,40,15 January 2018,"A pleasant restaurant in a nice spot, with an outside terrace, and a view.Good service and a nice menu mainly with meat cuts.We had first a good terrine, and then a grilled sirloin, with french fries of course!Great meat, juicy and cooked to our liking.A decent wines list with a good rosé wine too, ideal in this hot weather.Ready to good back as soon as i am tired of the local delicacies.Bravo."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great Steak & Fries,40,3 November 2017,I went to Les bouchons a couple of times already and I do not have much to say except that their food is very tasty and I always look forward to dine here. Overall great friendly staff to have a nice diner.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,affordable steak,40,23 October 2017,The steak is of big portion which can be shared if you are a smaller eater. Not really cheap but affordable for the quality. We had the bone marrow and onion soup too which is really delicious.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Deliciously affordable steak,40,9 August 2017,"Eating steaks can be an expensive business, but you needn’t spend big money to eat good ones.Although not cheap-as-chips, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is a quaint little French restaurant at Robertson Quay. Although I had a placed a reservation, the table I was allocated was in a twilight zone spot of the restaurant….partially inside and partially outside the restaurant. I ended up being moved to three different tables that one evening. That would have, on a normal night, spoiled my mood and appetite but the restaurant manager – Valentine, was absolutely gracious throughout and did his best to ensure we have a good experience.Now about the food…you can demolish either the grilled rib eye steak with “vigneron” butter or grilled sirloin steak with herbs, both served with Mixed Salad & Free Flow of Home Made French Fries. Either one and you will end the evening feeling pretty damn satisfied.I need to tell you about the fries. They are cooked in duck fat. Duck, fat and fries are three words that please most people. Combining them is a very beautiful thing. There’s no looking back once you have tried these brown and crispy fries.While not quite as revelatory as the hype might suggest, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche certainly dishes out good steaks. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Price on higher side but great steaks,40,16 July 2017,"Steak was great. Good and friendly service. Price is on higher side.
Restaurant has tables both inside and outside, next to Singapore river.
Menu is limited."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best Steak Frites in Singapore,50,11 July 2017,"Went here for a birthday dinner and had such an incredible meal! The staff were wonderful, the service fast, the steaks perfectly cooked and the salads and bread delicious. Each steak comes with a good sized side salad, a lot of fries and a selection of four sauces as well as a complimentary bread basket. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth and only cost 39 dollars! Not bad at all. The creme brulee was excellent and I could have easily closed my eyes and been eating and drinking along the Seine in Paris. Highly recommend this place."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Popularity well-earned,50,8 July 2017,Cute little piece of Paris in Singapore. Tried to find a small place for a somewhat romantic dinner and found it here. Food was good with not too expensive price tag. Service was friendly and exceptionally fast. Menu is short and simple so the kitchen is able to meet the demand. Hint: make a table reservation online especially on a weekend night - even if it was just an hour before your dining time.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great Steak,40,18 June 2017,"This is a good steak restaurant, quality food, good service, great location, and just a nice easy going place to meet friends and have a good catch up over great wine and food."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak - Good staff,50,8 May 2017,We really fancied a good steak and we got one. My wife and I shared the Cote De Boeuf. What a great steak. It was just so tasty and cooked exactly as we ordered. Had a really nice bottle of red to go with it and had a really enjoyable evening. Staff were great and chilled ice water was continually topped up.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Birthday Dinner.,40,5 April 2017,Birthday dinner for a friend was great. The steak was superb. Love the steak. The service was good as well as the staffs was very patient and polite with us despite us having troubles in ordering our food as we not too sure what to order. They served us the birthday cake with the lights off as well. Thanks for snapping for us pictures as well. I'm a hotel concierge that is located nearby robertson quay and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my guest without a doubt. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,A little cozy French Restaurant,40,14 February 2017,"Although the place is rather hidden, it was not very difficult to find behind the renovation works. Nothing to boast about the outside view as it was all cordoned off with. However the cozy ambience in the restaurant could make up. It was not a decadent deco, just warm and relaxing surroundings with kopitiam chairs, simple list of menu and bits of French posters.The restaurant wait staff are helpful, Restaurant Manager is friendly and can provide good recommendation. We ordered a ribeye steak and sirloin steak. They are quite huge (approx. 200-300 grams). Served with generous portion of salad and fries. Steaks are great, delicious and a real value for money. I asked them to change the fries to salad and I received two large portion of salad, the service staff accommodated to my request happily. Genuine, hearty food. They have quite extensive options for wine, but their house wine was wonderful! I have never enjoyed red wine as smooth as theirs. The dessert was unassumingly fantastic. I love how the cherries was soaked and drenched in brandy with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. This is a little heaven."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Early Vday celebration ,20,13 February 2017,"Bit difficult to find due to surrounding renovation works. View all blocked and was brought to a horrible corner table (just because we were early). Anyway, our experience:- Bread rolls served cold. - Butter frozen. - Servers casually dressed, could do with better uniform.- Steaks were done nicely.- Frites look unappetising but tasted good.- Salad portion was nice. - Chardonnay's good. Would we visit again? Probably not. Ambience and warm hospitality were severely lacking for this $150 meal. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steaks and ambience.,50,7 January 2017,"Les Bouchons moved recently from its former location but only a very short distance and is still located within sight of the waters edge at Robertsons Quay.This was our first visit, we were seated at a table outside although the opened up interior looked just as good.We ordered two sirloin steaks and one rib eye and a cap rest salad to share for starters together with plenty of drinks.The steaks were perfectly cooked and tasted delicious, the service was attentive without being bothersome and we had an interesting chat with the charming French manager.All in all a most enjoyable evening."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Delicious steak,40,30 November 2016,"Had the Ribeye steak on my visit. Requested the steak to cooked rare. The portion was relatively big, accompanied by a huge portion of French Fries. The steak I would say was one of the nicer steaks I had tried. Although it was a relatively short Anniversary celebration with my wife, I enjoyed the dinner."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak restaurant,40,30 October 2016,Met a couple of friends for dinner as it had been recommended. Menu offers mainly steak but there were a couple of alternativesWe all had rump steak which was served with chips and a side salad. I ordered medium rare and that's exactly how it was served. A delicious streak beautifully cooked and every relish to accompany it was offered.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best Steak Frites and Ambience,50,6 June 2016,"This is my favorite place for authentic steak frites in Singapore, with a very reasonably priced menu and great al fresco atmosphere flanking the Singapore River along Robertson Quay. Passed by yesterday evening and discovered from its website that the restaurant is moving to the Quayside a few steps down – will miss the original, quieter location."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average,30,23 May 2016,"Food and service was average. Good value for the steak and frites. Selection was good. Service not so good, they seemed to be rushing us along."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Very good, but....",40,17 May 2016,"The meat and vegetables are great, but French fries are a bit overcooked, too burned for us.
And the desserts are a bit too sweet.
Apart from that, for meat lovers, it is delicious!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Bad expierence,10,15 May 2016,"Came here with my partner and I asked to be sitted inside. The staff that served us wasn't very happy as she sitted us outside. We ordered for Grilled lamb and Sirlion steak but instead of received Grilled Lamb we got smth else instead, my partner was starving so he just ate it. The steak was good and worth the amount paid for which was about $40. Everything else was not worth the price at all. The red house wine was terrible. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Star of the show - Steak didnt quite measure upto standard,20,12 March 2016,"Went to this outlet since the one at Ann Siang was fully booked. It was a family dinner outing and other than the lovely setting overlooking the river, everything else turned out to be a damp squib. Service quality was very very basic, steak quality definitely very poor (The Ribeye was extremely stringy and the fat content too much). We had ordered for Medium rare and it wasnt done to perfection. Overall, it felt as if we were dining at a highway restaurant in the US. Value for money was also not very good. The housepour wine at 16++S$ was terrible."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Okay-Average,30,28 February 2016,"Had to send our steaks twice to the litchen because they kept bringing undercooked meat.
You would think a steak house would know what well-done means."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,All good except...,40,17 February 2016,"I ordered my steak to be charred on the outside and rare on the inside and got the waitress rudely rolling her eyes at me with the 'oh, another stupid Singaporean with a stupid order' look on her face. She thought I didn't see it but I did."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Couldn't better the steak,50,14 February 2016,"Lovely setting, excellent service, food was very tasty and well cooked, my very rare fillet steak melted in the mouth. Dessert options good and were well worth having"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Valentine's Day ,40,14 February 2016,"The steak was really juicy and well grilled, was juicy with the surface grilled just nice to give that slight yummy crispy coating. the classic Parisian bistro decor to the authentic menu- every detail has been meticulously thought out and beautifully rendered. The waitstaff were attentive and the wine here - they have a great selection too. The price is reasonable as well. I would definitely return to try the rest of the dishes. Overall a great experience without French fries."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Perfect place to eat cold steak,20,1 February 2016,"Simple offering, poor execution. Les bouchons use to be a good option on Rob Quay but no longer. Staff don't care, they would not give you a table in a empty restaurant because they are fully booked (what you only use your table once per night?!!) and they can serve you cold meat without even being embarrassed."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Husband's birthday,50,29 January 2016,The staff were very very nice to have held our table. We had to revise our reservation from 7.30pm to 8pm and we were late because we had taken the bus to the wrong outlet. Staff were accommodating and v helpful. And we enjoyed our steak a lot. Will definitely recommend and return. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Needs a major overhaul,20,25 January 2016,"No service for 15 minutes, no bread basket, burnt steak, light fittings and air con units that have seen better days, confused wait staff. We’re not on to a great start are we? Well, the concept of this restaurant is good – limited menu serving simple food, done well. In this case, steak frites is the star menu item but unfortunately the restaurant’s standards are slipping very fast. This was my first time sitting indoors here and before I even looked at the menu, I noticed that the once-impressive chandelier above my head, was missing several light bulbs. It looked dreadful! Directly in my line of sight was an aircon unit that looked dusty and mouldy, quite frankly disgusting! Why did I stay on? Well, because I’d been here before and the food had been good on those occasions, so I thought I’d ignore the cosmetic aspects of the restaurant and look forward to a nice steak. Had a hard time getting a waiter’s attention and it was 15 minutes before I even got a glass of water. No matter, we proceeded to order our food. We then noticed that all the tables around us got a bread basket, but not us. We ordered fillet steaks, one of the best cuts on the menu, and when mine arrived (ordered to be cooked ‘medium’), it was so burnt it left a nasty aftertaste! I requested this to be changed as it was unpalatable and as is usual in Singapore, the waiter had to “check with the manager” first. The manager / Maitre D’ was very courteous and helped to fix the situation immediately, no questions asked. The frites were a different story altogether – greasy, limp, with a few burnt bits scattered in for good measure. And the salad? If you like soggy leaves drizzled in so much vinegar it would make you wince, then come here. It’s like the kitchen staff have completely lost their passion for cooking – this was such a miserable experience. Perhaps it’s time for the management and staff to take a break, shut the doors and overhaul everything about this restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average food and wasteful portions !!,20,23 January 2016,"We have always been wanting to give this restaurant a shot and finally ended up here while talking a walk around the area. Service: nothing extraordinary.Food: average - definitely not worth the price. Most importantly, portions for the mains are just excessive and lead to a loads of wastage. Management should either rethink the portions or else inform the customers accordingly. We didn't find it worth at all. Better places in Robertson quay - you can give it a miss !!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good Service!,50,21 January 2016,The environment around is awesome! Recommended! Good service with very polite staff! I would go again!
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good food, service average",40,6 January 2016,"Great ambience because we had a table outdoor with a great view of the river. Food was great. Service was average as one of the waitresses seemed to have little knowledge of what's on the menu, hence unable to answer some of our questions."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good food, good service with good wine selection!",40,2 January 2016,Good but not great! The second time we went to the restaurant the Os A Moelle ( Beef Bone Marrow With Toast ) was served warm (not hot) and uncooked inside. We loved the Grilled Lamb Couscous. A good place with great ambiance for couples.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Underwhelmed By The Food,30,25 December 2015,"Firstly I'd like to thank the manager Zach for being accommodating and giving us an indoor seat although the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Eve. For the food, it's unfortunate that I was underwhelmed by it. Sirloin steak had too much fats in it, and the frites were limp. My salmon was too oily and I couldn't finish half of it. Our appetiser Os A Moelle (beef bone marrow) was extremely oily and it was a bit too heavy on the palette. Perhaps this is French cooking for you but for me, it wasn't the most pleasant eating experience. 2 mains with 1 appetiser came up to $115. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great Resturant for a Steak,40,21 December 2015,"Have visited this restaurant many times.Our meal was very good and the service was of a good standard. The restaurant is very close to the river and you can choose between inside and outside.If you are after a good quality steak in Singapore, look no further."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best value steak in town,50,18 December 2015,"There are cheaper steaks, and there are better steaks for a lot more money. But in terms of best value for money for a mouthwatering steak, you can't go past Les Bouchons. With free flow fries, dinner rolls and a side salad, you don't need to even order an appetiser. Best choice, go with the extra-tender Beef Filet with the Blue Cheese sauce."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Amazing steak!,40,15 December 2015,"Ribeye steak medium rare was perfectly grilled. Portion is big. Well grilled, every bite has got flavour, meat was tender with good marbling of fat at the side.
Fries were home made and cut in-house, very tasty too."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Visit for a drink by the river,30,15 December 2015,"The restaurant was ok and so was the service. I had the brochette of marinated lamb with salad and chips. It was passable, but nothing to rave about. Would not say this place is value for money. Love the look and the ambiance, the location by the river is lovely. Might be worth visiting for a nice drink by the river side."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointed with my steak,30,13 December 2015,"The starters and desserts were good but I was disappointed with my steak. It was tough and very fatty, which I didn't expect for supposedly the house best. The fries were delicious though."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Food quality has decreased significantly since our last visit,10,13 December 2015,"We had so much expectation from this place. However, food quality had dropped so much. We ordered cold cut and escargot as appetizers. Escargot was salty, fishy and oily. We ordered 1kg steak for 2 share. 1/3 of it was fats and bones that we couldn't eat! Our billed ended up to be $400. We will never come back! "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Cote de boeuf,40,12 December 2015,"Les Bouchons is always my choice of restaurant for good steak. This time I ordered the cote de boeuf for 3 pax (2 adult and 1 child) sharing. When the steak arrived, it was near perfect. As usual, the meat is tender and juicy, well grilled to medium to our delight. However, the meat around the bone is rare. Maybe, the next time I will request the bone to be well cook so I can bite on it. My kid feels that the fries should be crispier and that will be perfect."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent steaks.. Excellent price.. Great ambiance,50,10 December 2015,"Fantastic.. Will definitely come again

The first evening when I need to resource myself, I'm going in this very pleasant place. I take a a huge surloin steak with home made frenc fries.When I'm living, I'm full and relax."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Amazing food. Not so good service,40,28 November 2015,"Although we waited for the table, the steaks were absolutely perfect.
The staff is far from perfect, but in the end is more than worth the visit"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent couscous royal,40,28 November 2015,"Went to Les Bouchons chiefly for its couscous royal n it turned out to be excellent. Meat is tender n merguez is very tasty. Brought us back to Quartier Latin in Paris, while we're just here in Singapore! Only missing some French musics to suit the ambiance"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Great steak, good service",40,21 November 2015,"Quality of their steak is fantastic, though accompanied by a huge quantity of fries and over-vinegared salad. The chicken served with the Couscous Royale was dry but the rest of it was great."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointing ,10,14 November 2015,"Poor service, due to poorly trained staff, our waiter couldn't remember who ordered what from the aperitif drinks to the deserts. We ordered a 150$ red wine bottle but they couldn't serve it in proper red wine glasses (we had some kind of enhanced water or white wine glasses instead). Salad was over vinegared and when finally the meat came, we were relieved because it was the only enchantment of our dinner, quickly spoiled as the staff told us that there will be no free flow of salad, while it was very clearly written on the menu (they called it a misunderstanding!) Last, avoid the brownie for desert, it had barely no chocolate taste, was served with a very average industrial vanilla ice cream, and was way over cooked. "

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great experience,50,31 October 2015,Food took a while to come even though we were one of the earliest there. Other than that it was a lovely evening. Food tasted great and the service was just nice.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good services,30,24 October 2015,Service was great but food was just average. After reading the reviews I was looking forward to try but turn out to be just
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not as good as expected,30,20 October 2015,"Heard and read reviews that the steak from this place was one of the best. However, I was a little disappointed as a birthday dinner turned out to be one of the most unforgettable experience. There was a fly or mosquito flying around inside the restaurant and service was bad.The steak is not too bad and the portion is huge but the salad and cold fries were disappointing."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak and fries - don't miss their Beaujolais Nouveau party,40,17 October 2015,"Well-priced French steak and frites, Les Bouchons also throws the best Beaujolais Nouveau party on the river!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Decent steak, but service could be faster",30,4 October 2015,"This was our second visit to the restaurant, and I must say that the first one was better. The service was good up to the point that we were seated, then we felt forgotten about. The French manager is wonderful, but the staff not so much. For some reason, we had fruit flies buzzing around our table. The first time we told a server, he just waled away looking confused. The French manager later brought a bottle of Febreeze (wonder how thats going to counter the flies), sprayed that around the table and left, apologising profusely. In the end, we got a table outside.The food takes a very long time to arrive. It's good for a lengthy meal, but if you want to have dinner in an hour and be out of there, this is not the place to be.The steaks are very value for money, and the wine selection is good for the price you pay, but the quality of the steaks isn't really the best. But what more could you expect for $40?We had the bone marrow to start with, and while it was buttery and delicious, it was a tad under seasoned. It needed a squeeze of lemon to cut through it's richness.Desserts were good, and one friend commented that he would come back just for dessert, not for the mains.Would we go back? Yes. Because you won't find more value for money steaks anywhere short of making them yourself. The restaurant looks more expensive than it is, which is always a plus in my book. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Drinks near the river,40,18 September 2015,"We sat outside on tables right on the rive front, very nice environment for a relax, people watch and quite for conversation to easily be heard."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointing meal,20,2 September 2015,This was the third or fourth visit to the restaurant but unfortunately on this occasion we did not enjoy our meal due to the poor quality and toughness of the steak. We complained and were offered a complimentary dessert which we did not want. We asked for a reduction on the bill and were refused so ended up taking the steaks home for the dog who seemed to enjoy them. This was a special occasion with a visiting relative and was very disappointing. We will not go again.   
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Bon Appetite!,50,16 August 2015,"We made reservations through Chope and I highly recommend it. We had originally put in a request for indoor seating but all requests are not guaranteed. When we arrived, we were told that our reservation came in after all indoor tables were booked. Looking around I could see why. The inside of the restaurant was tiny. They were wonderful at finding us a seat outside and although it was a particularly hot night, they had fans outside which kept us comfortable. Turns out that it was more enjoyable sitting outside by the bustling River. I'll make outdoor reservations next time. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. We had a wonderful evening and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I look forward to our next visit and will be using Chope reservations again."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nice Ambient and Food,40,29 July 2015,"The steaks were not bad. Could improve on the fries though (they went cold pretty quickly).
Has a good selection of wine to go with your steak."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great French food complemented by excellent service,40,5 July 2015,"We were craving the famous steak frites and were excited to find Les Bouchons. The welcome was efficient, but not overly warm. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations. The food was faultless and the portions were ample, so we were not able to take advantage of the offer of bottomless chips...and the chips are fantastic. Our only slight gripe is that they close after lunch at 2PM. We will definitely be back."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steak, but nothing else",30,3 July 2015,"The steak is what they are famous for, and they can do that well and for a decent price ($38). However, the fries are below par, with perhaps only one slightly crispy chip out of 10. Entrées are average. Stay away from the house wine ($12), which is really not potable. Average service.There are more vibrant places in Singapore where you can have a good steak, and accompany that with decent entrées and wine."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disapointing to say the least,10,14 May 2015,"Our visit got off to a bad start when on arrival instead of a warm welcome we were told wait there I will check your booking. Service was poor the food worse. The staff made no attempt to be friendly or welcoming, they performed their work as if we were a necessary evil rather than a valued customer.My wife ordered Rib Eye medium to well, the meat arrived black on the outside cooked past well done, dry and tough. We passed this along to the waiter who in fairness offered to replace it but it took so long to attract the attention of the staff that my wife didn't wish to wait for another. There was no further attention from the staff other than to ask if we wanted more to drink.It was my first visit I certainly won't be visiting again. I prefer not to feel like an intruder. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak and refill fries...!,50,2 April 2015,"Situated on th Singapore river, great steak and the wines not bad too, although the wine is S$12.50 a glass (£6) , rib eye steak £17 ish. You can ay £25 for entrecôte. Had a lovely night, staff are friendly and helpful."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,An old friend...better than ever,40,25 March 2015,"Used to go to the Ann Siang restaurant every Saturday without fail when we lived in Singapore, but always found the Rive Gauche restaurant (despite the setting) a step or two off the pace. However, was back in town last week with my son (14), and we visited the riverside version Saturday night along with a friend. It may have helped that the excellent Ann Siang manager happened to be at the riverside version for a week (and recognized us from a few years ago), but our food was absolutely outstanding, as was the whole evening. Usual starters included smoked salmon and terrine de maison, but it was the filets that killed it...absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked. Desserts were completely unnecessary...so we had them anyway. Only reason it's not 5* is the prices these days..and even that's a little unfair since it's the same story all over Singapore. Absolutely terrific."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Nice ambience, polite and friendly staff",50,10 March 2015,"went on a weekday, it was a nice and quiet place for a romantic dinner with my so. had the signature steak and fries and it was fantastic! service staff were polite and friendly. would wanna visit this place again!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Fantastic Frites, Fast Food Service Speed, Overall C+",30,3 March 2015,"Arrived on time for 7:30pm booking. We were acknowledged by the Maitre'd however he stated he would be back.A couple of mins later one of the waiting staff approached us to enquire if he could help. We stated we had a reservation for 7:30pm in the name given at the time of booking. He checked and confirmed our details and directed us to our table.Our waitress was pleasant, but seemed to be in a terrible rush.Having delivered menus were were asked shortly afterwards if we were ready to order. I know its a simple menu, but we had come out for a nice relaxing meal, not really what one has come to expect of Les Bouchon.We placed our order for main courses, we had already decided to skip the starters, and shortly afterwards the salads arrived along with cold bread rolls.This is something that both branches have continued to fail on for a good few years. Originally the rolls were served warm, now it appears one has to request them to be warmed once they have been delivered.Shortly afterwards the main courses arrived a. Both steaks were cooked as ordered, medium rare, and medium. I must compliment this branch on their frites - They are out of this world!!!! A lot better than the Ang Siang Hill branch where the fries always seem to have been cooked and are reheated under a grill which results in rock hard frites.From start to finish, including settling the bill, 57 mins!!'Finally someone has come up with a Fast Food version of Steak & Frites!!!!!!!!Overall, not the type of evening my wife and I were expecting.The frites were Tres Bon, but I doubt very much we will not be returning to this branch.Service - 7/10Service Speed - 11/10Frites 10/10 Ang Siang Hill Frites (4/10)"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Too pretentious for a bistrot,10,10 February 2015,"Hi everyone,  My friend who is living in Singapore was trying to book a table for my venue with my family but it seems to be a ""tourist trap!"" We asked a booking for 14peoples, they called me to inform that we have to pay minimum charges 150SGD which is around 100USD for a steak and fries???? Couldn't be serious? Even we take many bottles of red wine but seriously for 14 people it is a LOT! I am disappointed of the reaction of the owner. Is that not too greedy to take advantage of tourist in this way? There is a lot of restaurants in Singapore, we found a great one in Duxton Hill ""l'entrecote"" with charming chophouse in the area so we did our booking without any problem!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great atmosphere,40,26 January 2015,"Great location just by the river, had steak with fries (free flow but did not ask for seconds as it is a lot.). Was served bread as a starter accompanied by salad. Salad was good however the bread is disappointing as it is cold and hard, making it hard to chew. The steak however was amazing. Kudos to the steak. Service is prompt and attentive. Overall was a great experience despite the rock-hard bread."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not existing anymore?? ,10,6 January 2015,Me and my fiance tried to find this restaurant for like half an hour and we could not find it. Probably they have closed down? we went to Vino Rosso instead and it was a good substitute.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Too much oil on my salad, the fries were spongy and the salmon didn't taste fresh",30,15 December 2014,"That about sums up my experience at Les Bouchons last Friday. While I was happy that they did not scrimp on the portion of the salmon, the fish didn't taste very fresh and it was quite oily when it was supposed to be grilled. Same with the salad that came with the dish. At least my husband enjoyed his steak which he said was pretty good and well prepared. Service was good and efficient. Located at Robertson Quay, the restaurant has a lovely view of the river that runs next to it. On Fridays, the area usually comes alive with people looking to welcome the weekend properly with good food and some drinks."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak and chips,40,16 November 2014,"We ate here on our second night in Singapore prior to flying out to Lombok the next day. Having spent a long day walking several miles with a few liquid refreshment stops, we were in need of a hearty meal and opted for Les Bouchons in Robertson Quay. The steak was very good with plenty of chips and a pleasant half carafe of red wine. Unsurprisingly it was quite expensive but par for the course in Singapore considering the location."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,what to say of a French Restaurant that fails French Fries,30,12 October 2014,"I little piece of beef, perfectly cooked served with burned, soft French fries and a good salad for S$44.The piece of beef was probably worth S$20. They are super proud of their homemade French Fries, but looks like no one knows how to make the best of it.No, I am not recommending this restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sorry - overcooked meat,10,9 October 2014,"Sorry - bad experience. I asked for a medium rare entrecote. The 400g entrecote was just overcooked - like a shoe - and the general manager claimed it was not. Very arrogant attitude, bad discussion, and bad overall experience. Don't go here if you appreciate a good piece of meet."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Beers and steak - bring it on!!,40,29 May 2014,Had the chance to go for a team dinner during a working trip. Was staying at the Gallery hotel and this restaurants is right there at Robertson Quay. Brilliant ambiance to begin with. Excellent food - recommend the steak for sure. Look forward to going back for another round soon.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,If you are up for a Steak go!,40,19 May 2014,"French style and taste, steaks of the fine art, great fries, sitting inside cool or outside a bit warmer, hip environment, wonderful appetizers, you name it. Add friendly service, pay for the value you get and you will leave the place feeling good and satisfied. I went there with friends and we just enjoyed it!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,excellent,40,14 May 2014,"delicious meat with the vigneron butter, french fries excellent, large choice of famous wine...
staff members so friendly"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Inedibles at les bouchons ,10,3 March 2014,"I ordered lamb kebabs and friends ordered steaks. A friend (French) complained his steak was overdone and an Asian friend complained her steak was overdone but their steak was still edible as they asked for rare and they gave them medium. My lamb was over done as well, I asked for medium. Also The lamb kebabs had big nerves that made eating it unpleasant as can't chew on the nerves. All the fries served were brown and inedible. A total let down.. They have a French floor manager who is absolutely friendly and nice but he has to be tough with his kitchen to reject food that looks inedible if no one cares and customers feedback! Definitely a place where I am not sure if anyone takes pride in their work.. What a pity. It has a decent bistro feel. Don't attempt , not worth it. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Actually very good,40,15 January 2014,Good ol steak frites much like you would expect in a good cafe in a major European city. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Make sure you sit outside if possible as the inside has exactly zero atmosphere. Dont both with the beef from Normandy just get the regular sirloin with fries and a side you like and off you go. Enjoy.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Arguably the best Filet Steak...""",50,10 December 2013,"One of the best, if not THE best filet steak I have had the pleasure of devouring anywhere in the world! And the never ending supply of beautifully cooked chips was very welcome, as they were so good also. A favourite restaurant of my Son who eats there regularly and I could really understand why on this evening's evidence. Yes, I can agree that there is little to commend the restaurant interior. If atmosphere is your priority then Les Bouchons is probably not for you but if you are looking for, possibly, the best steak in Singapore then you have to try Les Bouchons Rive Gauche (if you'll pardon my french!)."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Fantastic Chips,40,13 November 2013,"Came here with my family and although it was a bit pricey the food was very good. The steak was tender and had lots of flavours, but definitely come for the chips. They were very crunchy, like they were deep fried three times, and they have unlimited friesIf your in Singapore, and your in need of something french or something else besides Asian, come to Les bouchons, and you also get a great view"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Always a sure thing,40,26 October 2013,"Been going very regularly at Les Bouchons, every time I crave for a simple but very efficient meal. The ""steak frites"" is just excellent. Served perfectly grilled, withe a nut of butter atop. The french fries are home made, not these frozen stuff served in most restaurants. Sauces are the immortal mayonnaise and béarnaise. As a starter they serve you a well balanced green salad with wholenuts. They could do a little bit better with the wine per glass's quality. Nice terrace which brings the perfect atmosphere to share a simple dinner, at a very reasonable price, with some friends. An excellent ratio quality/price which never deceive."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Fries with your Filet?,40,25 September 2013,"Not sure why so many Singapore restaurants are focused on serving French fries, albeit they are ""French"".... I had the Filet which was excellent, and the only other thing on my plate was a huge pile of fries, which just did not seem appropriate."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent steak house,50,12 August 2013,"I have tried many steak houses in singapore but this one is definitely my favorite.The meat is delicious and so are the fries (if you like them overfried)and all of this at a reareasonable price for singaporeTheir outdoor tables have a nice atmosphere, but it's very bland inside so get an outside table."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good service, great steaks (and chips)",40,3 August 2013,"Overlooking the upper reaches of the river on Robertson Quay this restaurant offers good value for simple food, well-prepared. Three of us had steak and chips, one had lamb and sausage kebabs and chips. With a bottle of wine and other drinks the bill as 75$S each, or about 38GBP."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak has to be good to be acceptable...,30,19 May 2013,"Unfortunately, it was not. I have tried the little sister in Club St a couple of times and that. Has been pretty good. Tried the special. Entrecôte from Normandy but it disappointed. It was big, way too big but had no taste. Taste is the most important thing with steak. Wine was good and good value. Starters were also pretty good. Great if you like people watching but be careful with your choice....."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good honest steak in a relaxing setting,40,18 April 2013,"I have been here before, but stopped by again last night for a steak, together with a client. We took a table outside, to soak in the atmosphere of the Singapore river. The menu is short, but the food is well executed and geared towards steaks. I had a rib eye steak and my colleague had lamb skewers, both of which came with a mixed salad served beforehand. I ordered my steak rare, and it came just as ordered. We were debating whether to have a starter, but I am glad we didn't because the portions are generous. Fries came as ""free-flow"", which is a bit of a gimmick, because I don't know anyone who has actually finished the first portion! The wine list contains a selection of good wines under S$100 a bottle. Dinner for two with a bottle of good red wine was just under Sin$200, which in Singapore is pretty reasonable value for what you get.I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good, honest steak in a relaxing setting."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steaks, attentive service, quite expensive",40,12 April 2013,"After three days of mostly asian food, a colleague and I decided we wanted red meat. This restaurant has quite a small interior but plenty of space outside.Staff were attentive, steaks were fine. My rib eye was a bit too fatty so a fair amount of waste. My colleague had an entrecote which didn't look like it had been rested properly because there was plenty of blood on the plate by the time he was done. But he seemed happy enough.The bottle of wine we had was fine but expensive. Overall, fine, but not outstanding given their prices."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Brilliant Steak and Chips,40,2 February 2013,"This place is located under Singapore Tyler Print Institute and was a real surprise. I was really satisfied by the size of the steaks (300g) and the chips (free flow) were excellent. Nice location on the river, but they need to look at reducing their corkage. $30 a bottle and the cheapest wine on the menu is a average drop. We sat outside and the fans were just right."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,The nicer location but...,30,3 December 2012,"Les Bouchons' Restaurant at the River is in a nice location and the outside seating is just great (when it does not rain). Indoor lacks the ambiance of the Ann Siang location and is just too bright and without atmosphere. The food is similar, or is it just the ambiance that makes China Town the better steak? Good quality of meat and fries, a good selection of affordable french wines, but the service could be more attentive and is not that personal."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Huge portions, great service!",50,4 October 2012,"Me and my husband visited the restaurant whilst on honeymoon. We'd just arrived in Singapore and we came across the restaurant on a walk by the river. The waitress quickly organised a table for us, gave us menus and took our drinks order. The menu does not offer a huge list of choice but the 'steaks and fries' dishes that are available, left me with a tough decision, they all sounded delicious! we ordered starters which were lovely but when the main courses arrived I wished we'd not had them as the portion was huge. The rib eye steak although about the same price you'd expect to pay in the uk was twice the size and perfectly cooked to my request of medium rare. Then the fries... I don't know how they cooked them but they were the best fries I've ever had! A whole mountain of them and they were 'free flowing' ...the waitress actually asked if I wanted more! All in all we left very satisfied, the perfect start to our 3 night visit to Singapore. The staff made sure our glasses were topped up all night and were very polite and friendly. The only negative I will mention is that the tables are very close together so its not somewhere to dine if you want privacy but other than that I would recommend it to anyone in Singapore."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sense of real simple French food!,50,24 September 2012,"A wonderful setting, a simple but effective menu... Don't expect what they are not selling. It's not a romantic fine dining place. It's a great place to have fun with friends or with your family! Everything on the menu is as it should be done! Go on weekends and enjoy their couscous! Go any other day and you won't be disappointed! An address to keep in mind! "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Too much of a good thing!,40,17 September 2012,Had a dinner for 5 on Satrurday night.Service was professional and attentive and the food was very good.I had the Escargots followed by a half share of a cote de boeuf. All very good and priced highly but reasonably. None of my fellow diners had any complaints with their respective dishes.Tips - be careful with you appetizer size and the amount of bread you eat. Leave room for your main course!ProsAwesome french bread and authentic butter (a rarity in Singapore)Very good serviceFree flow chipsConsFree flow chips (don't overeat!!)Portion sizes are very large
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best French style Entrecote in Singapore,40,15 September 2012,"Set in a French style Brasserie along Singapore river, a restaurant that offers very high quality meat dishes prepared to perfection.
Service is professional and very pleasant
Wine list offers good value wines."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not quite what i expected,20,14 August 2012,"Went with friends for a birthday celebration, well, without the birthday cake thingy.It was my first visit, not knowing what to expect. But the reviews on this site says great stuff!The food was by far, just average. We have had better, but one certainly can't expect much for a S$46++ prime rib for 2! starters were below average, escargot had too much oil, the salads which came with the rib were full of mustards, fries were great as it was served hot. Skip the desert if you can, totally forgettable.Took about 30 mins for the main to arrive, we ordered 3 sets of prime ribs with various done-ness and an additional main to share, we were given fries enough to feed 10. We are well aware that the fries are free flow but the servers seemed to be conditioned in such a way that all accompanying fries need to be served with the mains, regardless if the table was overcrowded for more plates or for this case, baskets of fries. My point is, if the fries are free flow, come as when it is required, they do not need to arrive at the table with the main when there were more then enough fries. The servers do not seem to understand it, and they seem to be constantly under pressure, not sure why but they all look indifferent and definitely not too happy to be working there. They were amateurish at best, and didn't know what to recommend or even to caution if we have over ordered, which we did!The restaurant was full but i am not sure if it was just me, it was terribly hot and stuffy in their, definitely not a pleasant atmosphere. While the prime ribs looks pretty reasonable on the menu (S$48++ for 2 persons), the total bill didn't tell us that, it was close to S$600 for 6 persons. To be fair, other that the 3 prime ribs, we had king prawns (S$40++), a bottle of wine (S$105++), 2 coffees, a scoop of ice cream, escargots, caprese and creme brulee. OK, this was a case of us over ordering, just a note to self not to repeat it if i am to come back here, or try their better outlet on Club Street. (By the way, we came to Robertson Quay as Club Street was fully booked)Tip for those who wants to visit, the rib is big enough for 3 or even 4 if you are a small eater. The fries should be sufficient to let you walk out of the restaurant feeling full."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,BAD!!!!,20,10 August 2012,I used to go often when I first moved to Singapore and I slowly noticed how down the hill this place was going...hopefully one day it will get submerged by the river. A pity since the atmosphere is nice. I rather cook my own steak than eat here.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,cosy bristro,40,24 May 2012,"Was invited there for lunch and the place was cosy with an authentic french atmosphere, the escargot was delicious and the Rib Eye steak was done perfectly to our request, the a bottle of Chateau De Malleret and steak compliment one another."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Was much better 3-4 years ago,40,13 May 2012,"Brought my family of six there for dinner during mother's day. My wife and I have been patronizing this place once every 3-6 months for the past 4 years. They still serve their bread and frites free flow till this day.The steak is inconsistent, there're days when it's great, and there're days where it doesnt taste as good. The ribeye is fairly consistent and great, while the frites were sometimes just nice, or too burnt. Probably the most disappointing was when they started cutting costs and using 'peh-cai', chinese cabbage to substitute in their complimentary salad. Discerning customers like myself do notice such things. But all in all, still pretty decent value for money if you need a good steak with lots of carbs."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak frites with a nice ambience,30,29 April 2012,"The problem is, Les Bouchon is never consistent with its food EXCEPT for its fries... The fries were heavenly but the steaks were not always as good. Sometimes you are lucky and the steak is well done according to your request and most times, it's too rare to be medium or too well to be medium... The consistency for the steaks is just not there yet the highlights are the steaks....Too bad I love the fries a wee too much so thus restaurant is always in my mind... Probably the most expensive hand cut delicious fries in Singapore...Ooh, and the plus is that my favorite fries is free flow!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Warm welcome, good food",50,18 March 2012,"For simple bistro food, notably steaks (a wide range), prawns, frites, vegetables, salads and desserts, this could be a welcome change after an excess of fish-head curry, pepper crab, noodles and beer. Set in the quiet of Robertson Quay, just a few minutes' walk from the bustle of Clarke Quay, it offers an elegant ambiance and well-cooked plain food. There is an excellent wine list, including a wide selection of mainly French reds and whites and with big-name champagne at remarkably modest prices for Singapore. There is a terrace overlooking the river as well as the air-conditioned interior. Service for our visit was impeccable, with owner Sam providing welcome advice on the different cuts of steak and the wine list."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Better than some reviewers would have us believe,40,9 February 2012,"The key to enjoying this restaurant is to understand what they do well and what they don't. Food-wise, this is a great place to go for steak frites, which they do exceptionally well. My friend and I both had a nice big ribeye steak with a pile of frites and some creamed spinach. The location is great, almost like the ""Rive Gauche"" it takes after in Paris. Most people sit on the terrace outdoors, overlooking the Singapore ""river"" on Robertson Quay. There is an indoor section, if you feel the need for aircon. The wine list is also ok, with one or two nice bordeaux, but we also had a burgundy, which was not so good. That was the good news. The bad news is that the menu is very limited, so if you don't want a steak frites, then you are going to struggle. They could also do with a couple more side dishes. At the moment, there is a choice of creamed spinach, or er... creamed spinach. Some sugar peas or carrots would not go amiss. Service was ok, although could have been a bit more attentive.So, if you want a great steak frites (steak and chips) with a bottle of wine in a picturesque setting, then this is the spot. But if you want more of the general french restaurant experience, then go somewhere else."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Fantastic Steaks,Fries and Wines",50,23 December 2011,Best steak in Singapore. Love the ambiance. Always a treat to visit.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nasty,10,21 December 2011,"No longer as good as it was 5 years ago. Fries were burnt, steak was horrible. Stick to the club street branch!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Simple and tasty,40,28 January 2011,"You come here for one thing, a good steak and fries (even though i tried the couscous on the weekend once and was amazed by the quality of it, probably one of the best served that far from Magreb). Wine list is good, not great value but you're in Singapore... You will have to fork out 80-100$ to get something decent.Meat is good, fries home made. Nothing spectacular and yet one the best (western) restaurant on Robertston Quay."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Leaves a bad taste in the mouth ........,10,19 December 2009,"Dire. We've eaten at Les Bouchons in Club Street many times and always had great food and service. These standards are not emulated by the Rive Gauche restaurant in any way. After an hours wait I was served an American rib eye that was 75% fat and was clearly a very bad cut. Despite being summoned discreetly so as not to cause any embarrassment the waiter and management refused to accept that there was any problem and were extremely condescending and then became very rude. This was a simple issue about a bad cut of meat. It happens and it's just one of those things that restaurants know how to handle because mistakes do occasionally get made. It should be no big deal. Yet something that would have been so easily dealt with in any other restaurant was blown out of all proportion by two arrogant, small minded individuals who clearly need a refresher course on customer service. The attitude of the management is so staggeringly bad that Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is officially the worst restaurant I have been to, anywhere, ever. Vile, absolutely rotten."
French,Saveur,Enjoyable meal,40,13 October 2018,The place serves tasty food. Their foie gras is melty and delicious. The only complaint is the music is loud.
French,Saveur,Disappointed after the hype,20,6 October 2018,"The duck confit, sea bass and aglio olio were all below average. The only food that stood out was the panna cotta"
French,Saveur,Consistent good food & friendly service,40,2 September 2018,"Sunday lunch at Saveur, and it is not crowded. Service staff could improve by proactively check on customer, if ready to order. Overall, still a satisfying experience."
French,Saveur,Understaffed and long wait,20,24 August 2018,"We waited at the entrance for quite a while despite reservations as there was only 1 staff in sight and she was keying in food orders with her back to us. Cannot serve wine on a public holiday eve as they only had 2 servers i.e. understaffed. The girl was new so she keeps forgetting her orders/instructions straight after our sentence finished. Through the long waiting time, we already saw 2 couples walking out. For $85, not worth the time and service, can get better somewhere else."
French,Saveur,Simple and modern ,40,14 July 2018,"This is simple and modern French eatery located at the ground floor of The Cathay building.We had escargot, French onion soup, salad, chicken penne and duck burger. The presentation was good. The portion was good and the taste of the food was quite good. Overall, good value for money."
French,Saveur,"Great service, staff and food",50,29 June 2018,"Had the 3 course dinner on 29 June, and I wasn't super excited about the dessert for the set menu. That's when I noticed they serve creme brulee for 3 course lunch. So I enquired if I could change my dessert to creme brulee. The very nice and polite waiter went through the trouble of checking with the chef, instead of outrightly rejecting my request. I was pleasantly delighted that they changed the dessert for me. Although it may not seem much to some people, it's usually these little gestures that make the difference, and make people remember you. This definitely made my day, ending it on a sweet note. So, thanks for that Saveur @ Cathay!"
French,Saveur,Delicious food and good service.,50,24 June 2018,We have been to Saveur many times and have enjoyed every meal. Our particular favorite dishes are the Duck confit and the various truffled foods. Easy restaurant to enjoy a nice meal.
French,Saveur,Nice french food,40,21 June 2018,Ordered the set lunch. Duck confit is good as usual. Do hope they include more dish options for the set lunch/dinner!
French,Saveur,Saveur sans douleur ,40,16 April 2018,"Very good food for a fraction of the price at expat-run restaurants (and we’re not talking about the top ones!) Chili crab squid ink pasta is delicious and innovative. Don’t know how they do it, as rent is not low and they use expensive ingredients from Huber’s Butchers. OK, ambience and service are not as sophisticated as Odette’s or Robuchon’s, but you come here mainly for the food lah!"
French,Saveur,Good Set lunch and friendly staff ,40,18 March 2018,"This place never fails to deliver good quality food and at affordable prices. This time i ordered the set lunch. Selecting salad , seabass , sencha tea. Adding on a starter portion of pasta which i read rave reviews about it... the starter pasta was quite large for me! The salad was of normal size! I was expecting a small handful of salad .. overall was so worth the price tag. And the staff members accomodating and friendly . "
French,Saveur,Simple goodness,40,24 February 2018,Their signature duck confit and creme brulee dessert were just right. Simple decor and location made for a nice ambience for an afternoon with friends :)
French,Saveur,Valentine Date,50,17 February 2018,Food was great and their duck confit is a must order. However the staff seems rather short handed and multiple request from customers can overwhelm their workflow.
French,Saveur,Great location,40,10 February 2018,Great location - in the heart of Singapore. Had the Duck Confit and signature pasta. Food was delicious and service was good. Good to go early as the crowd starts coming in around 6.30pm.
French,Saveur,"Consistent food, inexpensive except for desserts",40,9 February 2018,"Duck confit, chilli crab squid ink pasta and sea bass great as always, but the prawn pasta was alright. Food took a long time to arrive and drinks served very late."
French,Saveur,Value for money,50,9 February 2018,"The prices of the food were reasonable, came in decent portions. Had the tiger prawn aglio olio and chillo crab pasta, both were delicious."
French,Saveur,Saveur,30,6 February 2018,The Airconditioning very bad. Quality of food so so... taste wise very poor. Not value for money....
French,Saveur,Duck confit was still as good as before,40,6 February 2018,"Been some years since I dined at Saveur. Went back specifically for the duck confit. It's of the right texture & crispness, yet not oily to taste. Certainly a place to visit for wallet-friendly quality duck confit."
French,Saveur,Saveur is good as always!,50,4 February 2018,"Outlet is now just called Saveur at Cathay. Food is good as usual, though the ambience feels different compared to the other saveur outlets. This Cathay outlet feels abit more industrial/unpolished."
French,Saveur,Dinner,40,1 February 2018,The dinner was ok ok. Had the chilli crab pasta and it was spicy. Overall good meal since we could use the entertainer app.
French,Saveur,"Nice food, atmosphere so so",40,30 January 2018,"We had the Foie Gras for starters, which was very nice. Unfortunately, though it was not late yet, they had already run out of Duck, which we had wanted to try. The pepper steak was a bit small, but nicely done."
French,Saveur,Limited choice of mains,30,26 January 2018,We wanted to try the roasted chicken breast but it wasn’t available on the day even though there were only a few mains choices available so it was a disappointment. Nonetheless the duck confit dish was ok for the price paid.
French,Saveur,Saveur,40,22 January 2018,"The crab pasta is 👍👍👍 recommended to try it
All thanks to entaintainer app. So the overall bill is more worth it 🙊"
French,Saveur,Average but could be much more better,30,22 January 2018,Service wasn't that good. It probably slightly below average as the service crew was not proactive and not easy to engage them. Needs alot of improvement.
French,Saveur,Nice duck confit!,40,19 January 2018,"I tried the duck confit, which was the signature dish. The meat is soft and tender, and the sauce is nice. Comes with a generous serving of delish mash potato. Worth a try!"
French,Saveur,Nice food but understaffed,30,17 January 2018,1) It took a while to process our order as the restaurant was understaffed. 2) The food is generally nice. My wife and I ordered the duck confit. The duck meat is not dry and it's juicy.
French,Saveur,Good food but pricey,40,15 January 2018,"Food is good. However, the pricr is considered high for the portion received. Place is comfortable for gathering and chit chat."
French,Saveur,"Great service, but the same cannot be said for the food",20,9 January 2018,I last visited Saveur many years and I recall being impressed with the food quality offered at the price point.

French,Saveur,Very good duck confit,40,8 January 2018,"Enjoyed their duck confit, still as good since I first tried it a few years back.

French,Saveur,"Great food, but small portions",40,5 January 2018,"Had a gathering here with friends. It was unanimous that the food was fantastic, especially at its price range. However portions were not big enough to be fully satisfying."
French,Saveur,"Average, Mediocre",30,2 January 2018,The overall food quality is average. Mushroom Risotto is good. Appetisers such as Truffle- fries is below average.

French,Saveur,Yummy food at affordable prices,40,5 December 2017,"I dined here with my friends on a saturday night and it was pretty packed, resulting in a relatively slow service. Our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive. - The salmon confit came in a awfully small portion but I guess you're paying for its quality! The texture of the salmon was amazingly soft and tender, melting in my mouth with every precious bite I took. The lemon vinaigrette that came with it had a sweet and sour taste, which paired really well with the salmon! The only downside was that the portion was way too meagre - perhaps they could make this a main dish instead of an appetiser, upsizing the salmon and adding a side to compliment it. - The duck confit, considering that it was a signature item on their menu, was perfectly executed. The duck meat was fork-tender and delicate, with the right amount of juiciness. It is served on a fluffy bed of mashed potato purée, sautéed mushrooms and orange segments. - The pork belly was served atop a substantial amount of ""Gabure"" french stew, with coco beans, mixed frozen vegetables, sous vide egg, and drenched in honey mustard sauce. The meat wasn't particularly memorable; it could do better with crispier skin. The french stew was average-tasting as well, and it got quite 'jelat' towards the end. - Truffle fries were served hot and crispy, but there was no distinct taste of truffle at all. The parmesan cheese shavings added a nice touch to the fries, but there was no dip to enjoy my fries with. I personally felt that this dish was rather disappointing. All in all, the food served here at Saveur is certainly above average and value for money, considering their affordable prices. If you wish to satisfy your french cuisine craving without burning a hole in your pocket, this might be a place you wanna consider dining at! :-) "
French,Saveur,Food was better than the Far East and Purvis outlet,50,4 December 2017,"They took some time to find my reservation from Chope, but it was understandable as we were still very early for dinner. The staff took our orders promptly and served us drinks (though payable) which were always refilled even when half-full. Food came all at once, which was abit uncomfortable - we had to eat the duck confit first otherwise it turned cold and leave the salads aside first. However, the chilli crab pasta and duck confit was really really good. It was our first time to the Cathay outlet, and I feel it fares the best out of the other 2 places we went (Far East and Purvis). The other downside was that the staff were crowding next to our table most of the time (while they wait for new customers etc), which is why ambience only 3 out of 5. Would still love to come back again, just in a different seat!"

Frankly, if I had added starter, mains and dessert - the cost would have been at least $35, and that is the cost of a fabulous set lunch at some fancier French restaurants in town.

French,Saveur,Non-existent Service,10,2 October 2017,"We went to the Cathay branch of Saveur. Glasses of water were not served, appetizers came AFTER main courses, horribly difficult to get waiter attention.

I wonder what we even pay the service charge for. "

French,Saveur,Average I would say,30,16 September 2017,The food potion is small and i feel food are over price but overall experience is average. Nothing bad though..
French,Saveur,Quality Italian food at wallet-friendly prices!,40,11 September 2017,Saveur serves really quality Italian food at prices that are easy on the wallet. Must tries are definitely the Original Saveur Pasta (just $4.90 only 😱) and the Signature Duck Confit!
French,Saveur,Food standard disappointing,30,11 September 2017,"The standard of saveur pasta has deteriorated while the mains have met expectations. We had the Pork belly, steak, sea bass and the duck confit. (Listed from best to worst). However, the ""star"" of the restaurant had to be the Caramel Lava Cake. It had no lava. we sent it back but the second one was not any better. The taste wise was also weird. Texture was not crumbly like a cake at all. more like a sticky huat kueh."
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur (The Cathay),50,10 September 2017,Food and ambience was good especially the foie gras and the pistschio pannacotta desert. Pork belly not so good but will try other food then next round. Service staff were nice. Thank you very much will definitely come back again.
French,Saveur,Good Experience,50,10 September 2017,"First time dining at Saveur with a big group. We got a mix of the dinner set and ala carte. Each course came almost together, including the main course. Service staff was attentive to us, as they noticed that we had a missing utensil without us informing them for one. The food was really good in general, except that one of the dessert was not available that might. The salted caramel lava cake wasn't as delicious as we hoped, but the panna cotta was really good. Definitely recomend the duck confit and sea bass there. The salmon confit for appetizer is really good too, definitely a try for those who like sashimi. Truffle fries was a little too salty to enjoy the truffle taste well. Overall good experience!"
French,Saveur,Won't be Back,10,4 September 2017,"Am not sure whether you have disabled the review function on your page, here's my share of my experience at your Cathay branch:Made an appointment via Chope on Friday at 12noon. Sat on the seats right outside the place, staff walked around, saw us, took their time and didn't open up the place till almost 12.10pm.Ate few times previously at the Far East outlet (FE) and was really impressed with the food. So we ordered 2 x Signature Pasta, 2 x Duck Confit with add-on soup & drink for one of the Duck Confit. Checked with one of the tall built with pony tail waitress whether I can use my Chope voucher, and was advice to show it to the cashier during payment.Signature Pasta came in a jiffy, my kids loved it, soup came shortly, but it was mildly warm, I expected something slightly hotter, since I was the first table there and food should be freshly prepared ?? Thereafter, it took very long for the duck confit to be served, but based on my experience at the FE outlet, good things are worth waiting for. To my horror, when the dish arrived at our table, it was a far cry from what I've had in FE, to begin with, the food wasn't even luke warm! The duck wasn't like what I have tasted, the skin wasn't crispy and the meat was like something that was grilled earlier and quickly heated up prior to serving, the temperature of the dish really spoilt the entire dish. I can't believe I've waited so long to be served with food prepared insincerely.To make things worst, when I made payment, was told that Chope vouchers cannot be redeemed during PH, I admit that it may be my fault to have overlooked the fine prints when I bought the voucher, but why didn't the waitress highlight to me when I was placing my orders! Totally changed my perspective of Saveur, all the best to the management!"
French,Saveur,Affordable French Cuisine,40,3 September 2017,"The food here is surprisingly good. We tried the set dinner which came with starter, main course and dessert. We love the starters - the onion soup and duck salad. And the finale-
salted caramel lava cake and pistachio panna cotta. Attentive Service staff too."
French,Saveur,First date,50,3 September 2017,Went to Saveur at Cathay for my first date. Had to say the food was really good and value for money. Ordered the set lunch which was only at 22.90. Had the appetizer pasta(forgot what it was called) which was really good. Main was saveur's signature confit duck which was really well done too. Only qualms was with regards to the portion of the dessert which could have been a little bigger in portion. But overall was really satisfied with the food. 
French,Saveur,Wonderful,40,30 August 2017,It was a delightful dinner at Concerto by Saveur on National Day! Food and ambience was just right!!!
French,Saveur,Food small portion,40,29 August 2017,"Business not very brisk, service was okay, food are fairly priced though comes in very small portions."
French,Saveur,Saveur,40,28 August 2017,"Was there with my friend but the service was bad. The waiter/waitress served our order late, sort of like mixed up our order with the table beside us and I was fuming mad for the long wait. Should have more staff when the place is packed!"
French,Saveur,"Overall satisfied, however prefer Far East outlet",40,28 August 2017,"Taste not as good. Service is ok, however for Chope reservation/discount, the crew have to consult the manager, perhaps should train all to be familiarize with the system. More effective! Better customer service can be archive"
French,Saveur,quite good and cheap food,30,24 August 2017,"quite good and cheap food in town. That said, most dishes are not available and it seems to be a recurring issue there"
French,Saveur,Ignore by staff,20,21 August 2017,"As usual when we reached the restaurant, we waited to be seated. At that time, the restaurant wasn't full house or crowded. Despite making eye contact with 2 staffs, we have been ignore totally. If staffs were busy, they could have given us hand signal and not ignoring customers standing at the door. As I have waited too long, in the end I had to approach one of the staff to tell her that I have made reservation and then taken to my seat. "
French,Saveur,Lovely lunch!,40,16 August 2017,"I made a reservation for the earliest Saturday slot days ago but I didn't have to as many seats were available and not many diners at that time.I ordered their new herb chicken dish and it was super! Delightful flavour! Also had their signature pasta which was not bad either.I was however, disappointed that they no longer have a pasta heavy menu... ;( wanted to try more after my first visit years ago.."
French,Saveur,Food standards have dropped,30,15 August 2017,"Used to love this place, not sure what has happened. Food was substandard. Sea Bass was not fresh and beef burgundy was watery and not seasoned well. Pork, Steak and Duck Confit was still good as was the hazelnut dessert but we used to find the food delectable and now it's just passable. Hope it was just an off day."
French,Saveur,Great!,50,13 August 2017,"Food is good, service is good too. Had a great dinner with friends there. Reservation process was easy and were allowed to sit down first and wait for others to arrive. Food was served quickly and the staff were helpful when we want condiments or a refill of water. "
French,Saveur,"Helpful staff, affordable menu, good food",40,9 August 2017,"We were attracted by the affordable rates of the set menu and were forewarned by online reviews of the tiny portions only to be pleasantly surprised. The starters like the onion soup was a hearty portion, and the duck confit was substantial and tasty. It is already known as casual french cuisine so we weren't expecting to be wowed by the food and were satisfied with what we got. We met with a terrible mishap when one amongst us got her clothes stained by red wine and the staff at the restaurant had promptly come to our rescue and even offered us a glass of white wine (and further advice) to help with the removal of the stain. We are still so grateful for the assistance. Thank you!"
French,Saveur,Good food but used to be better,30,6 August 2017,"Have been a loyal customer of saveur and we ordered the usual favourites. However, portions seemed smaller and tasted a bit too salty. Overall still a decent exerience."
French,Saveur,"Duck Confit or ""counterfeit""?",20,1 August 2017,"Had lunch with my daughter on 31 July 2017. Mainly because I had a $20 Saveur voucher. Just as well I had the voucher because with just 2 entrees and 2 glasses of water (@30cents), the total bill came to $38.""Well that's affordable fine dining."" one might say, Sadly, the only reason it was affordable, was it was not very fine.While my daughter's chili crab & squid ink spaghetti was tasty, the portion was hardly sufficient for a decent working person's lunch.It was a good thing she was a genteel eater so we both finished at about the same time. If it had been me, it would have been gulped down in 5 mouthfuls.Now to my duck confit. An objective description would be ""The driest piece of duck's leg sitting on powdery mash, with a tablespoon of sauted mushrooms by the side."" I'd more aptly call it 'duck counterfeit'.Perhaps the ambience, or lack of it prompted us to defer ordering dessert until later. So rather than risking it, we decided to look for dessert elsewhere. This turned to be fortuitous because we happened upon a great cafe in Takashimaya - but that's another story.Suffice to say, my first (and, I think, last) visit to Saveur was a great disappointment. Affordable? Yes. Fine? far from it. Sufficient? {stomach still rumbling)."
French,Saveur,Food wasnt fresh and poor service,10,31 July 2017,"We ordered the dinner menu. Firstly the duck in the duck salad wasnt fresh and there's a strong aftertaste after chewing on the duck. The salmon confit was slightly more fresh but the freshness is nothing compared to a salmon sashimi that you can find in a jap restaurant. My wife ordered the seabass and it didnt help to lift our mood in the restaurant. The dessert was the best dish for the evening. But it didnt help that for each course, we were serve a minimum of 5mins apart from each other. The dessert was a good 15mins apart, with my wife ordering a lava cake and myself a chocolate hazelnut. We understand this is a casual restaurant, we dun expect unforgettable food but at least just have the dishes serve almost together and not after 1 person has finish then u serve the other. "
French,Saveur,"nice food, reasonable price",40,25 July 2017,"prices are quite reasonable and the food is pretty good
had the chilli crab pasta and the mushroom soup."
French,Saveur,Efficient and helpful service but food is mediocre,30,23 July 2017,"The lady who served us was most obliging when we requested some changes to a dish which we appreciated. But the quality of our mains was below average. The duck confit was a tiny dry piece of duck leg. The beouf bourguignon was chewy, the taste was forgetable. The duck salad was quite good but v small. It's not expensive but not worth the trip "
French,Saveur,Saveur the Cathay,30,16 July 2017,"They had a few new dishes. The duck confit burger (new dish) was alright, but the duck confit main was not as good as I remembered. Shame.
Seeing it was a Friday evening, we were surprised by the lack of crowd too.
Thank you."
French,Saveur,Value for money,40,15 July 2017,"Authentic French food can be pricey in Singapore, which makes this place an absolute gem. The Duck Confit was delicious and very good value for money for the price"
French,Saveur,Messy evening,30,15 July 2017,The service staff seemed inexperienced and frazzled. Half of the time the orders were mixed up or forgotten (had to be prompted before food was served). Duck confeitt was good though! Atmosphere was relaxed
French,Saveur,Long-awaited meet-up with friends,50,9 July 2017,"I chose saveur as the perfect venue for a dinner gathering with a group of friends so we can meet up after not seeing one another so often. It's my second time to the restaurant. One of the reasons why I like coming to saveur, is the sense of home feeling. I love how beautiful the ambience, design and decor is, very unique to each individual restaurant. Pricing is also made affordable. Knowing how crowded it can get on Fridays and weekends, I'm glad I still choose to reserve a table for my guests and I through the Chope app. It's helped me in so many ways. In saveur whenever I show my booking code, they already knew we were being expected there. With chope, I can always feel at home and at rest, and a feeling of closeness. Thanks to the saveur team for hosting us. will dine again at your restaurants soon. Date of visit - 7 July 2017"
French,Saveur,Good service,50,9 July 2017,Basically the food here was not bad first time experience to me was quite good! Manage to try their signature dish duck confit and truffles fries. Both was good
French,Saveur,"Good Food, Service was a little slow",40,9 July 2017,"Food was good, enjoyed my meal. however, service was a little slow. it could have also been due to the fact that it was a Friday night, and there were many customers they had to serve. overall, still quite a pleasant experience."
French,Saveur,Food standard dropped!!,20,6 July 2017,Went to visit Saveur at The Cathy few days back. Their signature pasta used to be one of the must order starter at Saveur but now the standard has dropped. The pasta taste blend and their duck confit was so salty. Overall quite disappointed with the food. 
French,Saveur,review of dining experience,30,6 July 2017,"Food was decent, not superb. Portion was really small to fill the stomach. ambience was normal......"
French,Saveur,Saveur @ The Cathay,50,5 July 2017,I had a very pleasant dining experience at Saveur together with another couple. Very satisfied as they serve value for money food along with very good service and atmosphere.
French,Saveur,Quality without the hefty price tag,50,2 July 2017,"Decided to do a casual belated birthday lunch with a close friend. Lunch set always a good choice at a reasonable price of $22.90. We chose the Saveurs Pasta to start and it always lived up to its tasty reputation. Had the pork belly for the main and friend had the duck confit. Both wonderful and executed well. Only disappointment was the creme brûlée which one has to top up $2 for instead of the dessert of the day (vanilla ice cream). Well it wasn't the taste or quality that bothered me. Both my friend and I preferred the creme brûlée as our desserts when our orders for appertiser, mains and desserts were taken at 12:30pm. Our nice server came back at 12:32pm to say that they only had one creme brûlée left. No. Seriously? There was hardly a crowd at 12:25pm when we sat down. And the creme brûlée was out??? Oh well. I took the lacklustre chocolate ice cream instead. Minus the creme brûlée fiasco, it was still a very enjoyable meal as always with prompt service!"
French,Saveur,Good Food,40,26 June 2017,"Had the set lunch which was pretty good, especially the saveur pasta and the duck confit. Dessert was not bad too."
French,Saveur,Good service Good food,40,25 June 2017,Reservation was made and confirmation call was rec'd within half an hour. Service was good and food is nice.
French,Saveur,Ordinarily restaurant,30,25 June 2017,Very crowded place which I am unable to understand why. Food was so so but service was not too bad. For the price I think it's reasonable although not fantastic
French,Saveur,Experience at Concetto,40,22 June 2017,"Food was mediocre but portions were just nice. I felt that the caramel lava cake with vanilla iceream did not justify the $12 price tag, excluding gst and service charge. However, the starters and mains are good for better quality food with a lower price tag. I feel that the standards have dropped since the last time I went there."
French,Saveur,crowded restaurant,40,18 June 2017,restaurant is crowded and the seating arrangements provided is not well thought of. Overall food is slightly above average.
French,Saveur,"Honest staff, quick service and yet still good food",30,18 June 2017,"I went for last Friday lunch. The food is served 15 min after order. Quality of food is good. When we left, an honest staff ran out to return $2 note to us which he found on the floor. It was belonged to one of my colleagues there. Thanks for the honesty. "
French,Saveur,Good service and food. Nice ambient,50,17 June 2017,Went there during Monday lunch time. Not too crowded and service is good. They serve the next dish only when we finish the current one. Food is excellent as per usual
French,Saveur,Delicious French food at affordable price,40,17 June 2017,Saveur offers good French food at affordable price. Love their pasta appetiser and duck confit main dish. Worth returning again.
French,Saveur,"Excellent food, amazing service",50,14 June 2017,"The chili crab pasta was delicious. We also tried the salmon confit, pork belly, and duck confit burger. They were all very good.
The staff was engaged, and attentive."
French,Saveur,Worst of the saveurs,20,13 June 2017,I loved my food experience at another branch of saveur but this was nowhere near the same. The beef was dry and the pasta was average. The mocktail was tasteless. The server was new and didn't know anything when we asked her about recommendations.
French,Saveur,First time in Concetto by Saveur @ Cathay,30,12 June 2017,"This is the second time i tried Saveur but first time at Cathay outlet.
The food portion is rather small."
French,Saveur,Affordable Price,30,4 June 2017,Affordable price and acceptable food. Staffs are too busy handling the crowds pretty hard to get the attnetion of the staffs.
French,Saveur,value for money,40,28 May 2017,love the duck confit and the angel hair pasta. the wide variety of desserts are also consistently good. we like the salted caramel lava cake the best
French,Saveur,Ok,30,21 May 2017,"1 starter and 1 main that we order were good. But the pasta squid ink is like chinese food, rather than Italian food."
French,Saveur,Food still as good,40,16 May 2017,"Food is was delicious but I find that the duck confit was slightly more salty than before. Other wise, the saveur pasta is still as good."
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner,40,7 May 2017,It was a yummlicious dinner for my bestie's birthday. So glad she love the food & was so delighted. Definitely will be bck again soon.
French,Saveur,Great duck confit,40,2 May 2017,"great value for money and definitely one of the better duck confit i have tasted. only downside was the location, hard to find parking."
French,Saveur,Great experience!,50,2 May 2017,"The service was good, the quality of food was consistent with other branches of Saveur with reasonable waiting time."
French,Saveur,"Great taste, but Small Portions",20,1 May 2017,Got the chilli crab pasta - taste was great but the portion is so small and not even worth the promotional price. Pity as the taste was quite good.
French,Saveur,"Friendly service, good food at reasonable prices",50,29 April 2017,"Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the time we were at the restaurant. Loved the signature duck confit, as well as the appetizers (foie gras & truffle fries). A wallet-friendly restaurant to visit if you are craving for nice French cuisine without burning a hole in your wallet. :) "
French,Saveur,"Nice food, with reasonable pricing",40,24 April 2017,"Ordered duck confit, truffles fries and new addition in their menu - chilli crab squid ink pasta! the pasta was awesome, with the addictive sauce. worth a try!"
French,Saveur,Enjoyable dinner at Saveur,40,23 April 2017,"We went to enjoy Saveur's 6th Anniversary promotion but was told that we need to order 1 main a la carte meal in order to qualify for it (besides having a birthday girl). We chose to have the set dinners instead & the manager graciously gave us free drinks. Service was fast & efficient though the main course, their famous duck confit, took a little longer probably due to the large number of orders.The chocolate & hazelnut dessert was really good but we were all too full to finish it."
French,Saveur,Good for families,30,19 April 2017,"The meats were done very well. The Duck confit and pork belly were crispy yet tender on the inside. However, I did not like the soft mushy stuff that the crispy pork sat on. The signature spaghetti appetiser was interesting and quite pleasing."
French,Saveur,Cody and Affordable,30,16 April 2017,"Had the 3 course lunch set on Good Friday that only cost around $23++, which is very worth considering the location of this place. Food was alright and decent, service is a bit slow though."
French,Saveur,Good food but I'm annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy,30,14 April 2017,Food was delicious and good value for money but I was annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy and so won't be patronizing again.
French,Saveur,food standard has dropped,30,13 April 2017,we ordered all mains and some side dishes and the pork belly sauce was simply bland and another main dosh (fish) was not fresh enough and has a fishy smell.
French,Saveur,Wallet friendly,30,9 April 2017,"The steak was really salty, so were the fries. The other mains that we ordered was the duck and it was okay."
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner,30,7 April 2017,"The food is so so which is below our expectation, as compared to previous experiences in other outlets."
French,Saveur,A bit disappointed,30,5 April 2017,Food quality has decreased from the first time we tried. Quite disappointed. Duck confit was not as good as before and that's what we came back for
French,Saveur,Good food at low price,40,5 April 2017,"Generally their menu price is at a lower end as compared to other restaurants. However, they serve very nice food. Value of money!"
French,Saveur,Amazing Foie Gras!,50,1 April 2017,"Had a great dinner at Saveur Cathay. Our favorites are always the Saveur's Pasta (was done much better this round then before), the Duck Confit and the Foie Gras"
French,Saveur,SaveUr money and time.,10,1 April 2017,Pretentious French food with poor service. Served next course with no regard for customer whether they have finished eating. Small tabless not meant for dinner plates.
French,Saveur,Good dining option for an affordable french fare,50,25 March 2017,"Great ambience and food served. The choice of main courses are limited, however the quality of the dishes are overall quite consistent. Recommended to-go place with your date!"
French,Saveur,Reasonably Priced,30,21 March 2017,"I've dined at Saveur many times at different branches and I think an issue with it is inconsistency. The pork belly I had here was alright but the skin was hard to chew on (as opposed to crackling skin I had previously). One point I have to make is that though the food is very reasonably priced, the glass of wine I ordered was very little! It was definitely less than a standard serving!"
French,Saveur,Okay service and quick food arrival,40,20 March 2017,"The service was all right, and the foods did arrive quicker than we expected. The taste of chicken broth and mushroom were not bad, but not the pasta. However, I'm satisfied with overall service and waiting time."
French,Saveur,Excellent food and service,50,19 March 2017,"Food and service is excellent.
Friendly staff.
Food is served promptly
Very reasonable pricing as well"
French,Saveur,Worth going back,50,16 March 2017,"Food was good as usual, foie gras, duck confit, the salted caramel lava cake, all worth eating again. Ordered the 3-course set dinner, definitely worth the money.just that it was abit squeezy as they tried to put us in between 2 noisy tables. not sure why they dont like to open up their other space at the basement, but squeeze everyone at the top entrance level."
French,Saveur,Good Concept but Average Execution,30,14 March 2017,"The restaurant had ample space and a good place to hang out with friends and family. They were sensitive to customers' needs. Like calling us and informing us that they had only very limited food left because of an earlier event. Although It was only 7pm. All 4 of us ordered the ribeye steak (all medium rare). The steaks were medium and not as juicy and succulent as what we expected. However, I must say they actually do try to deliver reasonably priced food"
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathay,50,13 March 2017,good experience to lunch @ Saveur on a Saturday afternoon. staff very attentive and courteous. food is really money for value.
French,Saveur,Excellent French Food at reasonable prices,40,13 March 2017,"Very nice environment, convenient location with very delicious french food at reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again"
French,Saveur,Slow service,10,12 March 2017,"We got in at around 6:50pm on a Friday evening. We ordered our food quickly, before the crowd got in. We have got our main dish (duck confit) only around 7:20pm. In the meantime, the couple at the next table got in after us, got their main dish (duck confit and beef), and had almost finished eating by the time we got our food. We asked the waiting staff to check a few times, and each time they claimed that our food was being prepared.BTW, the chope voucher can only be used for a la carte items. Can't use for set menus."
French,Saveur,Good food with decent pricing,50,10 March 2017,"Together we ordered the mushroom soup, salmon confit, seabass, duck confit, pistachio panna cotta and the salted caramel lava. All didn't disappoint.
The only down point was we had to constantly ask the staff was our water to be refilled."
French,Saveur,Disappointing...,20,9 March 2017,"Used to patroniseat their first Outlet at purvis street. Much as we had to queue for a long time, the wait was very well worth it.. menu has changed and the popular dishes were either removed or didn't taste as nice as before.. sorry last visit!"
French,Saveur,Food was not very tasty,20,9 March 2017,"Second time here because the first time round I misread the terms and conditions of the chope voucher and ordered the set meal. This time round, the service of the stuff wasn't very responsive or friendly. Didn't feel very welcome by one of the female waitresses. Food was pretty bland especially the sea bass that I had. Funny how the potatoes had more flavour. The pasta appitiser was the only thing worth the money out of everything I ate that day. "
French,Saveur,affordable and delicious french cuisine,40,6 March 2017,We have eaten here many times with friends and colleagues who are visiting because it is at a convenient location. Food and service is always reliably good and they have affordable set lunches and dinners with portions that are a good value for french cuisine in singapore.
French,Saveur,Nice Duck Confit,40,6 March 2017,"Duck confit was good, recommend it. Sea bass was ok. The service was excellent as they constantly refilled our glasses and served each course immediately after we finished our food."
French,Saveur,Great Food Always!,40,1 March 2017,"Saveur is one of my favourite local chain restaurant in Singapore.They are specialised in French food with pocket frendly price.Love the Saveur pasta... it is soooo yummy. The duck confit is also one of my favourite and the meat is so nicely done and tender.As for the dessert, i would recommend the PISTACHIO PANNA COTTA!!! So smooth and delicious.Pls keep up the good work."
French,Saveur,First time at Saveur,40,1 March 2017,"Went there last Sunday for the first time. So had many questions how the promotion works. Was talking to the junior staff, thus she said she will check and get back to me on the questions, which was fine. Was going to order the chicken then they mentioned that the chicken and steak were sold out yesterday. Was wondering how come they didn't stock up for today as well. Luckily I am fine to order the other choices.. but was hoping to try the chicken though. Pleasant experience there. Hope to go there again soon. Thank you. "
French,Saveur,"Gd food, great service",40,28 February 2017,"Had the set meal, service was gd but waited for a while for the food. Other than that, it was perfect, highly recommend!"
French,Saveur,SAVEUR @ CATHAY,40,27 February 2017,Good value for money food . One of the best pork belly dish ever tasted ! Will definitely be back again !
French,Saveur,Poor service,20,26 February 2017,"Waited for an hour for my main course. Checked with the staffs 4 times, all staffs said that they had informed the kitchen. Spoke to the manager and realised that the kitchen missed out on our order. The food was served an hour fifteen minutes later. "
French,Saveur,Affordable casual french food!,40,26 February 2017,Affordable casual french food around town. My friends always order the duck confit (tender and flavourful) while I always order the Saveur pasta. It's meant to be an appetiser but I will order two portions as a Main
French,Saveur,Saveur-ing Dinner,40,25 February 2017,Made use of their ongoing $1 pasta promo (with purchase of any mains). The duck confit with truffle mash (+$3) was really great! Tender and succulent duck leg meat on a bed of creamy mash (apparently the truffle taste was pretty mild though) served with orange slices and sauteed mushrooms. The signature saveur pasta was not too bad but not as great as I've expected. Also ordered the salted caramel lava cake for desserts which unfortunately was a disappointment. There was barely any hint of saltiness that it could be easily pulled off as a normal caramel lava cake D: 
French,Saveur,Value for money,50,25 February 2017,Love the duck confit!!!!!! The dessert menu always changes but the pistachio pans cotta was good too
French,Saveur,Always so yummy,40,20 February 2017,"First time at the Cathay outlet. We ordered the Saveur pasta (it is never complete if you did not order this), mushroom soup, seabass and steak frites (medium rare). ALL were super good. Highly recommend the seabass and steak. I am still drooling typing this."
French,Saveur,Good standard and meet expectation.,50,17 February 2017,"I always enjoyed the Duck Confetti on their menu, which is a must try. I must say this is a decent place to go out with dates, well not to forget to mention, the affordable price tag. If only they could come up with more innovative quality dishes for a twist!"
French,Saveur,dinner for 2,40,16 February 2017,"took too long to serve, waited 20 mins for dessert. service not up to standard, staff were unfriendly."
French,Saveur,Food was ok. But dont expect too much from service. ,30,16 February 2017,"Food was almost tasty, except for the duck confit that was a little too salty for me. The dessert was fantastic!!Service did not do justice to the good food offered. Serving staff don't quite want to do what they should. Appetizer only came right before dessert, despite several reminders. The staff just didnt bother to follow up. "
French,Saveur,Saveur is good,40,14 February 2017,I love the duck confit and the salmon confit at saveur. The salted caramel lava cake is also delicious!
French,Saveur,Try the foie gras,50,14 February 2017,"Whatever else you order, don't miss out on the foie gras (fatty liver). Price has gone up but it's still the good ol' melts-in-your-mouth fatty liver that complements any set meal."
French,Saveur,Will not pay a second visit,30,12 February 2017,"The service was quite terrible during our visit. No one was trying to serve us until we ask for it. I personally walk to the counter to order food as the stuffs pretend not seeing me when I raise my hand. Plus, no one was trying to entertain us when we first step into the restaurant. Food quality was average and nothing to be impressed. Will not pay my second visit to this restaurant. "
French,Saveur,Attractive price,30,12 February 2017,Prices are pretty awesome for French cuisine. But we were not particularly wowed by the food quality. But I suppose u get what u pay for.
French,Saveur,Good food value for money,40,12 February 2017,"Good food. Value for money. Convenient location but ambience inside the restaurant could be better.
Good service. Nice music"
French,Saveur,Gathering,30,10 February 2017,"Decent and value for money French fare in downtown for all ; Friends get together , gathering in the week ."
French,Saveur,Great plc for meetup!,50,28 January 2017,Had dinner here and the duck confit and mushroom aoup was gd! Will be back again for another visit next time.
French,Saveur,Straightforward and Enjoyable,50,24 January 2017,"Saveur makes French food affordable while offering great taste. The dinner sets included appetizers, main dishes and desserts, which were appealing, but we ultimately chose to order a la carte entrees and shared appetizers because of the discount from an e-voucher we used. Also, located on the first floor of The Cathay facing the street makes this restaurant easy to find. Plus, the wait staff were so friendly and helpful in answering our questions."
French,Saveur,Only duck confit is worth it,30,20 January 2017,10% vouchers not usable with set meals. So the vouchers are not worth it. Duck confit is really good! But the rest are average only. Staff did not even inform us that plain water is 30 cents and assumed we all want it.
French,Saveur,Excellent service and reasonable fod,30,20 January 2017,"The overall layout and atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Loved the simplistic design and the open ceiling concept. The staff were friendly and service (including food serving speed) was good. Only let-down however was the quality of the duck confit which I ordered, the duck felt a bit dry and the mashed potato had a cheap taste to it."
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur Cathay,40,16 January 2017,"I pop by many Saturdays after a long day which ends in church opposite. In a sense the laid back atmosphere is a plus when you want good food in a hurry. Recently they started the set dinner menu which is good value for money. Today I had the foie gras with grapefruit, a generous serving and the grapefruit a nice counterpoint to a nicely seared liver. The beef short rib braised with red wine was a fairly small portion for me but melt in the mouth tender. Desert of the day was to be chocolate tart which they replaced with vanilla ice cream but where nice enough to change to a refreshing lemon vinigrette salad dotted with olives and hazelnuts which was good with the heavier meat I had chosen. All-in-all a good meal for $29++ so yes I came back again! "
French,Saveur,Not given a table sitting although there were free tables,30,13 January 2017,Came in 20 mins earlier than reservation timing for dinner at 730pm. There was a table clearly free for 7 people but were asked to come back at 730pm. Staff serving should be more flexible to serve the need of the customers.
French,Saveur,Standard has dropped,30,11 January 2017,"Used to frequent this place when it first opened. Food is still value for money however standard has dropped. Cooking of the food and taste has dropped from what I remembered it to be and so has the portions. Still a value for money meal, but not as great as what it used to be. "
French,Saveur,Lovely dinner!,50,9 January 2017,Dined here a few times and food quality has always been consistent! I Will be back again! Yummy food!
French,Saveur,Good food!,40,9 January 2017,"Had the lunch set of 3 items. The food portions were just nice. The pasta was well done and yummy, the duck was seasoned well."
French,Saveur,Great place for a large group meetup,40,6 January 2017,"Went for dinner with a group of 7. The ambience, large floor space and comfortable seating was nice and we l had a great time. However the price of the food has sure gone up, when 5 years ago, the duck confiti used to cost $8.90 as compared to $14.90 now. Also, the place seemed understaff with only 3 service crew for 2 floors. "
French,Saveur,Food was great but overall experience not so impressive,30,2 January 2017,"The food was well presented and was delicious. However, seabass was a little too dry. Dessert was not served with cutlery."
French,Saveur,Restaurant was inflexible in stanchart credit card promo,30,31 December 2016,"Having been to Saveur since its beginnings as a stall in Tanjong Katong Coffeeshop, it has come a long way. however, the expansion seems to cause some quality of food, roots and values to be eroded. Other than the food whose quality somewhat is not comparable to the good old days, Staff were also incapable of being customer centric when dealing with the credit card promo, which really ended the dinner on a sour note for my friend who was footing the bill. Definitely higher standards are needed for this restaurant to stay its course. "
French,Saveur,Cosy with no frills,40,27 December 2016,Had the duck confit and pistachio panna cotta. Both were excellent albeit the small serving size. White and red wine are affordable at $9 per glass. Excellent service as well!
French,Saveur,Christmas Menu Not Up to Standard,20,26 December 2016,"Reserved a table for Christmas, as I enjoyed my previous experience at the restaurant. However, the recent visit was disappointing - chicken consomme was too bland, ""medium-rare"" beef was almost raw and the plate was full of blood with a charred sides & the lobster pasta tastes like your usual $3 hokkien mee. Their signature duck confit would have been a much better choice."
French,Saveur,Decent food at affordable price,50,26 December 2016,"Went with a group of 6 adults and 2 kids, chose this place as it's kids friendly. They provide baby chairs and kids cutleries upon request. It would be better if they serve kids menu. Surprisingly it's a bit quiet, which my friends and myself like so that we can have proper conversation. "
French,Saveur,Service,30,26 December 2016,Food serve was a lil slow. But overall ok. Atmosphere was ok a good place for gathering. Will still return.
French,Saveur,Value for Money French Food,40,25 December 2016,"Value for Money French Food. Service is a tad slow though. They seem short handed.
But the food is good for its price.
Had the duck confit. Mash potatoes were smooth and duck was tender."
French,Saveur,Weekday Dinner,40,22 December 2016,This is my 1st visit to Saveur. I enjoyed my set dinner very much. All the 3 courses are well prepared. Particularly enjoyed the foie gras appetiser and the beef short ribs. Good value for a French meal. We were pleasantly surprised to be asked if we enjoyed our meal. Good that the management valve our feedback.
French,Saveur,Good quality food at afforable prices,50,21 December 2016,"Enjoyed the food, good ambiance. We had the set lunch. I had the Saveur pasta, which is very yums. For main course, the famous duck confit and for dessert, they ran out of vanilla ice cream which was in the set, but they replaced with something even better, chocolate mousse with crushed nuts. "
French,Saveur,Food is fabulous,40,20 December 2016,Went on a friday evening. Quality and portion of food are excellent. Just a bit noisy on a busy evening. Overall very satisfied. Thanks Chope for the instant reservation service online.
French,Saveur,"Good food, not so good service",30,19 December 2016,"The food was good as usual, but the service, not so great. It felt like they didn't know what they were doing. 5 of us ordered set meals, but we only got 2 out of the 5 drinks and 1 out of the 4 desserts we ordered. Every time we asked for them, the staff would punch it into the system like it was an additional order before bringing it. Needless to say the bill was all wrong. Had to do the correction for them, the cashier had to print the bill 5 times before she got it right. "
French,Saveur,Average,30,15 December 2016,Supposed to be the place for cheap french food but prices have been creeping up. Suppose will be better topping up the extra to dine at a legit restaurant. Still tasty nonetheless
French,Saveur,Fine dining at an affordable price,50,15 December 2016,Food was very delicious! Service was alright but could be better. Would still come back for another meal!
French,Saveur,"Main dish sold out very fast, truffle mash without truffle oil",30,14 December 2016,"Overall food is not so bad. We arrived at 7pm Sunday, most of the signature main dish were sold out. We were not told that the kitchen couldn't prepare truffles mash before we ordered it. After clarified with the staff, they mentioned that the waiter earlier may be not well trained due to she is a temp and offered to compensate to us. Since she apologised sincerely, we don't mind having back the same dish without refund. Even though our dining mood was not affected, I found that it's not nice to have twice disappointment for customers 1) most of main dish sold out, 2) wrong food served, which the management can look into it to improve."
French,Saveur,Underwhelming,30,13 December 2016,"Not sure if the general Saveur quality has dropped just this outlet. We had the Saveur pasta which was cold, and they ran out of a few items because of a problem with the truffle oil. This made the used-to-be amazing mash potatoes served with the duck confit disappointing. Got the milk & cookies dessert, which was a fun dessert but portion was just too small for $9.9. We also tried to use the Chope voucher, but I would not recommend it to anyone because it is just too restrictive, being invalid on public hols and the eve, and only valid for ala-carte items. They wouldnt even freaking top-up of $4.5 for the ILT and soup, and you can also forget about the daily promotions."
French,Saveur,Saveur at The Cathay,20,13 December 2016,Service was really bad and they charge for plain water at $0.30 per cup. Tried the duck confit -- good value for money but it looks like the restaurant was severely understaffed on a Thurs night.
French,Saveur,Nice experience,40,4 December 2016,"We had the saveur pasta, lamb shank and duck confit. Service was good and food was served fast as well. Consistent quality"
French,Saveur,Saveur,30,28 November 2016,Dining at Saveur was average. Service still consider so-so. Truffle fries taste not strong enough. Price wise also average.
French,Saveur,Value for money,40,24 November 2016,Value for money but the service is slow. Small layout and selection is not large. Certain items are not available
French,Saveur,Nice quiet(er) date,40,19 November 2016,"Had a nice date with my boyfriend, there was 50% discount off the starters. Unfortunately, they didn't give me the discount (I found out only a day later).We ordered the mushroom soup and Saveur Pasta as starters, which both were good. The Beef Short Ribs was small, but surprisingly filling. My boyfriend could not finish the steak. We topped it off with pistachio panna cotta which is good for sharing."
French,Saveur,Average food and setvice,40,13 November 2016,The food is a bit salty. Waitress who served us put on a smile. When come to food serving...not a single staff ask us whose food it is. We have to swap ourselves.
French,Saveur,"Acceptable quality of food, generous portions, but service need to be enhanced",30,8 November 2016,"Food is good, not fancy sort but tasty. Portions were ample. Great value of lunch set.
Service really need to be improved. Staff are not very attentive, and lack of service knowledge. No major complain but was just observing."
French,Saveur,Good place with good food,50,7 November 2016,"Food was great, service staff very friendly. Reasonable price. The outlet was easy to find. Ambience was nice."
French,Saveur,Service could be better,30,7 November 2016,"Our reservation was 745PM, we reach the restaurant at around 715PM and request for an early check-in as we saw the table that was reserved for us available. We understand that our appointment time is not up and the restaurant reserve the right to let us in only when the reservation time is up. However the staff who attend to us is very rude in her reply. Regardless of what enquires we enquire, she gave us a very black face and only replied us that our reservation is at 745PM so we cannot sit in early. Hence we strongly feel that the respond and service provided by this female Filipino staff could be better, as if we did not remember wrongly, she is actually a managerial rank staff. Other than this, the overall dinning experience was pleasant."
French,Saveur,Must try!! Affordable French cuisine,40,6 November 2016,"The dishes are delicious; and they are nicely presented on the plates; Price wise they are affordable; French food.
However, they serve the main dishes just we starting to eat our starters. And that's bad timing."
French,Saveur,A Few Good Dishes But Disappointing Promotions,20,3 November 2016,"The mains and pasta we ordered are good but the sides of Truffel fries and soup are less impressive.The promotion basically give a feeling that the company want to give but don't want to give, For example, chope vouchers cannot be used with promotions (luckily we ask before purchasing the voucher), if get combo then can't get the promo price, promo only applies to lower price items which is the usual practice.Atmosphere is so so and almost like fastfood restaurant feel, waiters are not proactive.Feel that overall even though some of the food are good aren't worth the price."
French,Saveur,Great experience,40,1 November 2016,"Great dinning experience, will visit with other friends too,
Must make a reservation in order to secure a seat"
French,Saveur,Not a bad place for a date,40,31 October 2016,The ambiance was good with trendy music going on. A little crowded but wasnt that bad. Food was excellent thou
French,Saveur,Reasonable for price but not fantastic,30,29 October 2016,"Good to get the choke vouchers if you are making a booking through chops, that lets you save $5 from $50. The food is reasonable for its price but don't except high end French food. The foie gras could have been better though! The taste was a bit strong at times, and it didn't really melt in your mouth. The sea bass was also a bit too salty and fishy. "
French,Saveur,Affordable French Restaurant,40,18 October 2016,"French food not necessary to cost a bomb, Saveur is a good place to enjoy decent french food at affordable prices. However, I find their set menu are very inflexible, everything cannot change! from food to drinks to whichever. What if some don't take certain kind of food and drinks?"
French,Saveur,Won't return again,10,16 October 2016,"I walk out feeling like I owe the restaurant something. Will never go again and won't recommend to anyone. Food though good, service standards are worse than a canteen!"
French,Saveur,Great French food!,40,9 October 2016,Value for money for the duck confit! They revamped their menu end up I preferred the previous pork belly thou. The creme brulee was excellent too!
French,Saveur,Really great experience!,50,7 October 2016,Dined here a few times and the food and service is really good! Love it and will definitely visit again!
French,Saveur,Would Have been 5 stars,40,5 October 2016,"Heard about Saveur and gathered 3 friends to try the food at The Cathay outlet. Firstly there was no set lunch. To be fair, it was Monday and the menu had JUST changed. But there was set lunch available when the reservation was made. oh well. Just my luck Secondly, it seemed that 40% of the menu wasn't available- very strange. we wanted truffle fries- not available. so were the pork belly, seabass, beef short ribs, etc etcFood was good for those available dishes we ordered.was a birthday celebration for 1 of us and the staff were ok to provide a candle for 1 of the desserts. "
French,Saveur,SAVEUR PURVIS STREET is better,30,3 October 2016,"I've been to the SAVEUR PURVIS STREET before and enjoyed the quality dishes and nice service. But the service at the Cathay is quite disappointing. At first, when we were ordering a bottle of red wine, the waitress recommended us the 1 for 1 glass of wine, so we ordered 4 glasses of red and white wine. After serving 2 glasses of red and white wine, the same waitress came to apologized for that the promotion is no longer valid. Why didn't the waitress inform before serving? We were not able to change the order to a bottle of wine. After we finished the main courses, we kept looking at the waiters but none of them came to clean the table until my friend went to inform them that we were ready for desserts. One of the waiters even looked away when he noticed that we're looking at him. "
French,Saveur,Nice and cheap!! ,40,1 October 2016,"You won't get disappointed at Saveur, good food with good price!!
Menu variety is not wide but they know what they're doing.
Somehow the set menu is not served today but they offer S$4.9 top up with salad/soup & drink for your main."
French,Saveur,Chope voucher is for a la cart food only,30,1 October 2016,I have bought chope vouchers for set meals and I have used chope vouchers for set meals at many other restaurants. However only Saveur made their own rules that it can be used for a la cart food only. Disappointed because this terms and conditions were not told or written.
French,Saveur,First time to Cathay outlet,30,26 September 2016,"The place is cosy. And the food standard is the same as Purvis and Far East. One of the server is quite attentive, when my friends finish their wine, she came over to serve them without us asking for any help."
French,Saveur,"Delicious, but Complacent to Allergies",30,21 September 2016,"My fiancée and I dined here on Sunday, 18 September. We had made a reservation so we were seated immediately and staff were quick enough to take our order. My other half and I decided to each have the 3-course set dinner menu: she ordered the foie gras starter, beef tenderloin and chocolate and hazlenut dessert, while I had salmon for starters and mains and the dessert entitled ""cookies & milk"". Unfortunately, none of these courses had any further descriptions save the names of the dishes on the page (no ingredients lists or allergy/dietary warnings; see the image attached). We were also not informed that the dishes were listed separately on other parts of the menu, something which is not always done in restaurants (it is not unusual for dishes to be designed specially for set menus).In any case, it transpired that the dessert I had ordered contained peanuts to which I am allergic, though only mildly. My fiancée had asked the waiter regarding the desserts whether they contained peanuts and he stated that they did not, only hazelnuts. I was surprised, however, that he did not investigate our enquiry any further than this, such as check with the chef.I subsequently had an allergic reaction to my dessert, but was able to recover without medical attention. When we brought up the lack of warnings with staff, they were nonplussed by events and simply asked us to direct our feedback to their generic enquiries email address which we promptly did (we have as yet received no reply).Overall, the food (as pictured) was very good, but the lack of customer care, certainly where something as serious as food allergy is concerned, left something to be desired."
French,Saveur,Set Lunch at Saveur,30,19 September 2016,Reasonable priced set lunch . but food taste abit salty then usual visit. Will be good if Saveur's can look into this and provide customer a healthier dining meal.
French,Saveur,Nice food,50,18 September 2016,Food was nice as usual. No waiting time required as we have made the reservation earlier. Great experience.
French,Saveur,Good food at affordable price,50,17 September 2016,Been twice and both times were great. Love the dinner set which is priced reasonably at $29.90++. Great quality and taste for the price!
French,Saveur,Yummy dinner,40,17 September 2016,Came here with friends and recommend having the duck confit. It was a nice evening dinner where we were able to chat and chill. Food was good but music was a little loud that we had to talk over it.
French,Saveur,Great service and great food,40,8 September 2016,"The staff who welcomed us did not make us feel very welcome. She had this grumpy look and started rattling what they have and not have before we could sit down. But after that, we had great service from the staff, including the one who welcomed us. I guess we arrived at the wrong moment. :) We enjoyed the food (the portion was just nice for ladies), one-for-one wine and the duck salad. The restaurant was nice and cozy. We will definitely go back again."
French,Saveur,Food taste good,40,5 September 2016,"Had set dinner. The food tasted good. A little pricey but recommended for another visit.
You may or may not like their industrial interior. Open kitchen concept, so your clothes may get the food smell. Overall pleasant experience though"
French,Saveur,Saveur's Review,50,30 August 2016,"The quality of the food is spot on. If you're looking for a place to have nice food and drinks, saveur's the place you might want to place it on your check list."
French,Saveur,Thumb up for the food,40,26 August 2016,The restaurant have 1 for 1 wine promotion. Me and my hubby enjoyed the food as well as the wine in this kind of relaxing atmosphere. Will come back again.
French,Saveur,Weekend lunch,30,24 August 2016,"Been to Saveur at Cathay. It is no longer called Concetto? We were a party of 3 with 2 set menus and ala carte orders and made a reservation through chope. Staff wasn't too attentive but it was probably because we were sitting at a corner?My friend had the mushroom soup but we both felt that it didn't turn out as expected. Other than the taste of mushroom at the end, there wasn't much taste of mushrooms. The mash potatoes on the duck confit was so sticky. Duck leg looks flatten into the mash. My medium rare steak was done to medium but it was great. Only problem is we were probably not use to the cheese in the herb butter. I was glad I tried a little of it before putting it on my steak. It was difficult to swallow and I wouldn't have eaten my steak if I put any on it. Dessert was the best. The consistency of the molten caramel that flowed out from the lava cake. It was just nice and not too sweet. The pistachio panna cotta had the taste of nutty pistachios. The creme brûlée has berries on it. However the moisture on the berries ruin the crisp of the sugar coating on top of the creme brûlée. It would have been better if the berries were not on top. It looked pretty though. I order a bottle of red wine and it was suppose to be 1-for-1. I had to bring it up before they bought me second bottle. Thank you for placing it in a bag and letting me bring that home even though the staff mentioned that promo was only valid if I drank it there. It didn't make sense for me to take up table space for another 2 hours just to open and finish another bottle of wine between me and my friend. "
French,Saveur,Nice Restaurant,50,17 August 2016,Had a lunch here last Sunday. Nice food and ambient. The price is affordable for French cuisine. Enjoy my lunch here.
French,Saveur,Very decent experience,20,15 August 2016,"- Were told to change table when we were having desert to give way to other customers, which is quite disruptive. As a result, me and my friend rush to finish up the desert and left the place.- Food taste was okay but the portion was rather small for a guy- The ambient isn't that great for dating, slightly cramp and lack of decoration "
French,Saveur,Nice food,40,9 August 2016,Food was great but portion could have been slightly more. They charged for water but was not prompted in refilling it. My Friend and I were not full after the meal.
French,Saveur,excellent food,50,8 August 2016,Visit saveur multiple times. Serve good food with reasonable price. Enjoy the food. Always recommend to frenz
French,Saveur,Value,40,1 August 2016,The starter and main were acceptable good but the drinks & dessert are normal. Overall is value for money.
French,Saveur,Concetto by Saveur,50,25 July 2016,"Im not sure if this was the same place as I had been before (they were serving lots of pasta before). Much to my demise, I couldn't get to have pasta again. The set meal was very filling but very pricey."
French,Saveur,What's the point of having good food when there is a bad service and poor attitude?,10,25 July 2016,"I was really hesitating to write this review. However, it is still kind of disturbing for me to recall this bad experience I had in Saveur Cathay. I was with my family that day and have made a restaurant reservation via Chope app. Upon arrival, we are served by this Philippino staff (looks like the restaurant supervisor, who is at the same time attending to the cashier). Initially, she served us with a smile and took our food and drink orders. We ordered only plain water (fyi, plain water costs 30 cents each). We have ordered 4 glasses of warm water and 1 glass of cold water. She repeated our orders as clear as crystal. However, moments later, she turned up to our table with the wrong order (it becomes 4 glasses of cold water and 1 glass of warm water). Instead of apologising for serving us the wrong order, she blamed me and insisted I was the one giving her the orders. I was so angry and pissed and at the same time, she did the roll-eye expression and she did not even apologise at all. Moreover, she just left the water and walked away.What kind of attitude is this, I was thinking. I tried to move on yet our food orders turned out to be wrong too. It was a total mixed up and luckily my hubby took the initiative and went up to clarify all our orders again with her. Imagine this??!?! What service is this when I am actually paying for the service charge?I cannot believe this... At the end of our dinner, when I was making the payment, she did not even bother to communicate to us and just handed us the total amount (where I have to manually offset the chope voucher myself with the bill) and just asked me ""CASH OR CREDIT"". Seriously, is this the way how Saveur survived through these years? Correct me if I am wrong... I did not remember Saveur to be like this, I had my many lunchs and dinners in Saveur (Bugis Purvis Street) and it was really one of my top most choices. Now.. after this bad experience, plus with my family members there, I will not go and visit anymore EVEN the food was good.I will also advise my friends to think twice about visiting Saveur.. I rate this establishment with a 3'D's.. Disappointed, Dismay, Discomfort & Definitely Disgusted!"
French,Saveur,Brilliant food!,50,24 July 2016,"Food is always consistently great, it never fails to delight my friends and guests alike. Tasty, affordable and reliable, what more can I ask for?"
French,Saveur,foie gras can be better,40,21 July 2016,"1 side is slightly crisp, the other side just nice 100% cooked, no crisp at al. feels like the chef forgot abt that side. not as nice as it usually was. beef tenderloin was wonderful but the sides werent to my liking. but worth it for dinner set. the sea bass was even better i feel. the potatoes were great. however they dont give discount when i use voucher from chope when they said can, the last time i went. oh well. servers are more attentive compared to elsewhere...... "
French,Saveur,Saveur@Cathay,40,21 July 2016,"It was not bad for a casual French cuisine restaurant and quite good value, especially when there is promo. Especially like the salmon confit - A Must-Try!"
French,Saveur,Quick lunch,30,16 July 2016,"Come here for quick lunch and order their set lunch. Their signature pasta quite nice, main course that i order is chicken roulade with risoto (ok not bad). Dessert is the winner for me that is pistachio pannacota. Quite sweet but but nice or maybe because i like peanut.The ambience rather ok. As the service considered not bad."
French,Saveur,"Good food, not just good value",50,14 July 2016,Saveur has upped their game from their early days in a coffee shop. Now it's good food and not just good value.
French,Saveur,"Decent overall, but service staff could do with more training",30,10 July 2016,"Quality of food is good, but knowing that it's part of the Saveur group, we had expectations of better initiative from service staff, who obviously were either very inexperienced or part-timers. Otherwise, it was a rather delightful dinner (in spite of the squishy table arrangements)."
French,Saveur,Too long,20,8 July 2016,"Waited for food for quite long, the duck starter for the 3 set course is not nice. The kitchen is too loud."
French,Saveur,Amazing Food always,40,27 June 2016,"The food is without a question, great. Portion is also generous. But my wishlist will be that recommendations and slight enthusiasm will be great."
French,Saveur,worst visit ever,10,25 June 2016,"Dont waste ur time and money go somewhere else. Service staff is snobbish, food is worst. Totally do not worth the amount been charge. Staff took super long to serve us and we have to keep chasing after our orders. Overall we spend and average of $50 pp and it is just horrible."
French,Saveur,Will come back again,40,22 June 2016,"Ordered : foie gras with lentils, salmon confit, baked chicken, salmon, beef, chocolate &hazelnutFoie gras: creamy,melt in your mouth goodness, paired perfectly with lentil to bring down the oilyness. Salmon: 2.5 out of 5 stars. Barley risotto is sour and uncomfortabke, salmon skin is excessively salty. Only good part is the soft,moist pinkish salmonC&H: heaven on first 5 bites.Jalat after. Crunchy bits gives texture to this art piece dessert and the raspberries help to lessen the jalat feel. Pure sinful .yum."
French,Saveur,Father's Day dinner,30,20 June 2016,"Had the angus beef Father's Day set. Beef was not cooked to right doneness (med well) and had to be sent back, came back still too bloody."
French,Saveur,value for money,40,18 June 2016,"food is nice and price is really cheap, butthe tables are so tiny, only can barely seat for two people…"
French,Saveur,another trip,30,17 June 2016,"the foie gras was not as crispy as it was supposed to be. duck confit was nice as usual. the beef tenderloin was superb. aft the meal i felt cheated tho as i wanted to choose my preferred seats but they said other seats were reserved, yet i also did make a reservation but was given some random seats. ironic isnt it. causes the experience to dim a little. not that i was being fussy on that day."
French,Saveur,Disappointed customer,10,15 June 2016,Service was slow. Waiter forgot the order. Waiters were looking down on the floor half of the time and not attentive. They even missed my special request for a cake for my mother for her birthday.
French,Saveur,Good service,50,15 June 2016,Had a birthday celebration there and all was good. We could keep our cake there as well for quite a few hours ahead of our dining time. Service crew was courteous and food was good! Duck confit and truffle mash is the best
French,Saveur,Thumbs up,40,13 June 2016,"Reservation was fast to confirm & everything was good. However, not quite sure why the restaurant that day had a very strong oily or fried smell that lingers on your clothing. Normally it wasn't like this."
French,Saveur,"Food is good, a pity no birthday special for customer visiting them on actual day of birthday.",40,9 June 2016,"We love the yummy food and it's presentation. We love their desserts too. The ambience is a bit cold, lighting too dark, we visited them on a rainy day for lunch. Too dark to even take picture nicely. Maybe lighting not enough, need to call the staff a few times to get their attention. The staff are otherwise friendly and nice. We love their food but it will be a plus point if they could improve on hospitality. For customers visiting them on their birthday, it will be really nice if they could even give a slice of cake or a special drink on the house. Well, I'm just suggesting. Maybe at night the place will be more romantic with it's dark setting. My visit at Saveur on evening is more pleasant.I will visit again and look forward to an improve ambience."
French,Saveur,French made accessible,40,4 June 2016,Party of 7 for Mothers' Day Lunch. They have a discount for the 2 mothers in the dining party which was a more meaningful gesture than the typical overpriced special occasion menus. Saveur stuck to their tried & true set lunch menu. The dried baby shrimp & noodle appetizer is noteworthy as is their entrée duck confit. All the other options were no less delicious. They're affordable and unpretentious. On the repeat list. 
French,Saveur,Exceeds expectations,50,3 June 2016,"The food exceeded my expectations, could tell that much thought was put into cooking the food. Loved the Salmon Confit especially and the cookies and milk."
French,Saveur,Excellent customer service and slightly above average food.,40,1 June 2016,"The food was not the best, but slightly above average. Duck confit's a must try! Truffle mash was really tasty.
The customer service makes up for the moderate food though, keep it up!"
French,Saveur,Set Dinner,40,29 May 2016,We had the 3 course set dinner. We were pleased with the quality of food served and at an affordable price for french cusine.
French,Saveur,Naise,40,23 May 2016,Food was good for the price. Service was great and the overall environment was really nice to chill :-)
French,Saveur,Friday 20th May,10,21 May 2016,Meal was served wrongly. Duck confit was hard. Seabass tasteless. Full house on a Friday night yet they were severely understaffed. Wasn't as cheap as I heard it would be. It was almost $70 for 2 pax.
French,Saveur,"Great food, Small portion",40,10 May 2016,"go there with an open mind, portion isn't big so don't go there with a hungry tummy and expect it to be filled.. French cuisines are known for small portions. Overall we had a wonderful meal and great location before catching our movie @ The Cathay"
French,Saveur,Great food. Fast service.,50,9 May 2016,Great food. Fast service.Except the dessert has rum marinated grapes and need to highlight esp got kids ordering .
French,Saveur,Good for family weekend brunch,40,5 May 2016,"It's quite vacant on weekend, very nice for brunch with fam. Have been there a couple times now, always go for duck confit."
French,Saveur,try the baked chicken instead of the known duck confit dish,40,4 May 2016,foie gras was of top standard this time. the pasta was a little plain w little tiger prawns in mini cubes. the oven baked chicken was freshly baked and the truffle mash go along w it perfectly as usual.
French,Saveur,good food and value for money,50,2 May 2016,"recommended. food is awesome and price is value! will go back again. space is small, service is quick, menu is clear. should have some photos of food for easy selection. I have to google or search on ig for food photo to know what i'm having. "
French,Saveur,Fine dining at affordable prices,50,2 May 2016,It was really crowded. Luckily I could reserve through Chope! Food was delicious surpassing my expectations! The deco was kept to a minimum which is a good idea to keep costs low!
French,Saveur,Simple evening in town,40,1 May 2016,"Visited this restaurant with the GF over the Labor Day weekend. We were quite satisfied that the place was peaceful and allowed us to enjoy a lovely conversation over dinner. We ordered Saveur's Pasta for starters to share, and Chicken Roulade and Pork Belly for mains. The food was as expected: simple, affordable and definitely value for its price. Overall, we would recommend for anyone looking for a simple and unpretentious meal with their SOs."
French,Saveur,Quality not compromised by crowd,40,1 May 2016,Went there on a busy Saturday evening. They seem to be running on minimal manpower. However the staff were polite and efficient. The quality of the food was great. It wasn't compromised at all.
French,Saveur,French cuisine at the Cathay,30,1 May 2016,"Affordable French Cuisine at Cathay. We made reservation on line and was seated directly. Restaurant was crowded and seems not enough servers. Food are good. Try the variety of appetizer like salad, Foei Gras with apple and escargot, well prepared. We also tried the pistachio for dessert. Perfect choice. Can improve the service "
French,Saveur,Good food as usual,40,30 April 2016,Always a fan of the saveur pasta and duck confit. Waiting time was acceptable and service was generally good.
French,Saveur,Affordable,40,28 April 2016,"Food selection was not wide. However, the prices were very affordable considering how they are situated in town. Ambiance was less than satisfactory because of the noise and crowd. However, the duck confit was a winner. The foie gras was, however, disappointing. So is the Seafood Bisque. Garden Salad and Escargots were average. The Saveur Pasta (appetizer) was delicious! "
French,Saveur,Fantastic food but lack of service,40,28 April 2016,"My favourite food there is saveur pasta for my appetizer, then duck confit is for my main course. Unfortunately, the service is terrible, the hostess or staff didnt assist me or tell me where is my table, then the staff there is not friendly( they show attitude) "
French,Saveur,Great Service!,40,28 April 2016,"Last week we were celebrating my friend's birthday at Saveur and we had a great time there. The foods are delicious with reasonable price. I requested to put some wording on the dessert in order to give a surprise to my friend. The staff helped me to do so and, on top of that, they lighted up a candle for us as well. Really appreciate that. We will definitely revisit the restaurant again. Thank you."
French,Saveur,Family dinner @saveur,30,26 April 2016,"Slow serving, had to wait for awhile for the food to be served. Food was consistently good among other outlets. Its just the waiting time and that the ventilation wasnt working very well"
French,Saveur,A rather disappointing experience,30,25 April 2016,Disorganized. Appetisers came after the main courses. Had a better experience at the Purvis Street branch
French,Saveur,Good,50,25 April 2016,It is a place where good food are made affordable for people. The service is also good with the venue being accessible from dhoby ghaut mrt station.
French,Saveur,"Food was great, service okay, waiting time EXTREMELY BAD",20,16 April 2016,"My friends and I ordered the 3 course dinner set. After the starter, we waited at least 40mins before our mains came. The dessert took 20mins after main course. We were just glad that we weren't rushing for a movie. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who isn't prepared to wait."
French,Saveur,Affordable French cuisine,30,9 April 2016,"The price is attractive but the portion is very small. Good place for gathering with friends and try out French food. Tried the Saveur pasta, duck confit, pork belly, and lava cake with ice cream which costs as much as our pork belly main course :) The duck is so so, but I like that it was not salty like some other French restaurants. The pork belly reminded us as Japanese ramen dish, and tasted similar too! But disappointed at the presentation, in a bowl, with gravy, like ramen without the noodles :) "
French,Saveur,Food taste good and affordable but service average,30,9 April 2016,"You don't get the welcome greetings nor look as you step in. We were there for snack but no sandwiches except mini mushroom soup and mini small pasta which both taste good. Soup served in a tea cup size. See my photo. But ice lemon tea was served super sour and I had to request for a change. Waitress said they made a mistake of 3 parts lemon and 1 part sugar instead. Oh well, if you are just passing by and it's not crowded. Hop in. But won't make a trip deliberately just to eat there."
French,Saveur,Comfortable setting,40,6 April 2016,"Nice food, prompt service, comfortable ambience. Abit pricey but of coz not expensive compared to other French cuisine."
French,Saveur,Pretty great,40,1 April 2016,"Service was alright, nothing to complain about. The food was great for the price. Would definitely come back again. :)"
French,Saveur,Average service,30,31 March 2016,"Service was very average. My plate was not cleared after we were done with the meal. For a good 20min. Staff were walking right past us and never once asked to take our plates away. Had to ask for them to clear it and bring out the dessert. The salted caramel lava cake is honestly one of the worst desserts I've ever had... The ""cake"" had a rubbery texture and the entire filling was salted caramel so the sweetness was just overwhelming. The duck confit was the only saving grace and that's the only reason why I'd ever consider going back...Disappointing experience. Been here twice before and this was the worst experience. "
French,Saveur,No coffee at Saveur during lunch hours,30,31 March 2016,"We were disappointed to be told that there wasn't any coffee left at 12.30pm on a week day. I was treating my friend to a farewell lunch and she had wanted a flat white but the server said (very nicely though) that they had run out of coffee, which is a little weird since it was only start of service. The irony: I much preferred the menu at Concetto before they became Saveur!"
French,Saveur,Small servings,30,27 March 2016,There was a party of 8 and it was our first visit.the food is average priced but in small portions.a few of us did not have enough from our own main entree.There was limited selection of beverages and desserts.This would be an alternative venue instead of a choice.
French,Saveur,average,30,26 March 2016,"i loved the relaxed atmosphere, the food was good, but each portion-size was different from person to person. service staff were attentive and polite, definitely a plus point."
French,Saveur,Experience soured by service,30,25 March 2016,"The food was excellent. Kudos to the chefs. Unfortunately the service staff could do with more training. Water not refilled, orders had to be repeated, 2 table settings for 3 pax. I lost count of the number of times my hand was raised to get their attention. Staff seemed more keen to interact amongst themselves than with customers. I'd only consider coming back to this outlet for the food."
French,Saveur,Atmosphere of shop,30,19 March 2016,The shop is big but looks so empty. The atmosphere not good compare to another outlet at Far East that I always visit.
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathy,40,11 March 2016,Will revisit & recommend. Food is good. Pricing average. Saveur Pasta a must to try. Except no coffee...
French,Saveur,Cheap French Fine Dining Experience,50,8 March 2016,"Brilliant main course. Do try their Salted Caramel Chocolate Lava cake. In all a complete value for money. Portions are small, very French indeed."
French,Saveur,-,50,8 March 2016,It is value for food. The service is good. I enjoyed my dinner there. Sad thing is dinner 3 course menu doesn't include duck confit for mains otherwise would have ordered the course menu dinner
French,Saveur,poor service from the restaurant manager,20,7 March 2016,"i need to wait the menu for 5 min after seated. no one notice that we cannot order because the absent of menu.
we need to wait another 15min for our pre-ordered dessert after we completed our main course."
French,Saveur,Excellent Food for the Price,40,1 March 2016,"Went for their Valentine's set menu and it was very good. Portions were just right and generous considering the price.Only upsetting bit was actually nothing on the restaurant's part, we were sat next to a very unpleasant group who were being very difficult customers with a whole slew of 'custom orders' that kept changing. But kudos to the staff for handling them with poise and patience! (:"
French,Saveur,Affordable quality food,40,29 February 2016,First time at Saveur and I am loving it. The food served are of good quality and affordable. The 3 course meal is a good deal but only if your stomach have space for that. Do book early via Chope so you will avoid to queue. 
French,Saveur,Poor quality of food and choices,20,26 February 2016,"Aside from the cozy ambience, food choices were very limited and poor in quality (food was cold for me). Place was also slightly filthy with ants crawling up my arms every once in a while and a dragonfly which came to visit whilst waiting for my meal to arrive."
French,Saveur,Feedback,30,25 February 2016,"The Saveur pasta was lacking in flavour, this was a tad disappointing as i remembered it as being very tasteful."
French,Saveur,Good food but iced/warm water is chargeable,30,15 February 2016,"Overall experience was good. Service was prompt and reservation was easily retrieved. However, menu was unclear of which dishes were not available.
There was no option of tap water and iced/warm water was chargeable at 30 cents per glass."
French,Saveur,Valentine's Day Dinner,30,15 February 2016,"Went to Saveur for its Valentine's Day set meal, we were seated promptly. The place was not too noisy as compared to the branch at Far East.We waited more than 30 mins for the appetizer to be served. I'm not sure if the waitress left us out or was too busy to keep track of our courses. She came to us and asked if our appetizers were served. Shouldn't they take note of customers' orders?Next, I bought a cake and left it under their care to be temporarily stored in their fridge. To my greatest surprise, my cake was served to the guests seated on our left side! I had to highlight to her that the cake belonged to me. She swiftly wanted to serve us the cake while we were still waiting for our main course to arrive and that spoilt the surprise I had for my fiance.Next, we were served ice water that was ordered by the guest seated on the left! Once again, I had to highlight that the order belonged to the next table. Are customers expected to help remember orders for the waitresses?Although I was disappointed in the service, I must say that the food were freshly prepared. I enjoyed the food there but would seriously think twice about returning. Hopefully the management can look into staff training."
French,Saveur,Saveur at Cathay,50,11 February 2016,"Good ambience and also food is affordable and delicious! Must try their duck confit. There's a promotion going on, order 2 mains to get a free appetizer pasta which is totally worth it!"
French,Saveur,It's great,50,4 February 2016,"Great food, great service. Very cheap and tastes nice. Food took a little long to come but there was full house on that day."
French,Saveur,Not a quack when it comes to duck,40,29 January 2016,My wife hv our weekly dates n it's up 2 me 2 find new n wonderful places to eat. I'm not a lover of duck but i tried. But we'll from a non lover i really loved it. Really good food
French,Saveur,Alright experience,30,17 January 2016,We sat at a corner table that night and food came without a long wait but the ice water we asked for never came even after we finished the meal. And no service staff was around to help us! We were quite disappointed with the service 
French,Saveur,Ok.,30,9 January 2016,"Had high expectation for the duck confit but when I tried it, it didn't really ""wow"" me. Slightly understaffed but can be corrected easily."
French,Saveur,"Great food, nice ambience at very affordable price",40,9 January 2016,This is my first visit to Concetto although have been to Saveur several times already. The festive set meal is quite limited but we have option to order from a-la-carte menu too. This might not be possible during Christmas period in other restaurant. Overall the food is very delicious and will definitely visit again.
French,Saveur,"Food was great, staff are attentive",40,30 December 2015,"Food was great, staff are attentive and fast to recommend similar food when the ones we ordered were not available. The restaurant wasn't too noisy, conducive for small gatherings with friends. Will be better if there are more choices for dessert."
French,Saveur,In-efficient,30,23 December 2015,"Ambient is good. Food is a 4, but service isn't initiative enough and orders were forgotten. Could be improved on that."
French,Saveur,Spartan environment concept. Ok food.,30,19 December 2015,"First and foremost, keeping the name ""Saveur"" does invoke certain perception on the quality of location, environment, service and food.I have not been to Saveur, but being one who usually researches and looks at reviews prior, I have been forewarned to lower my expectations and not compare it to Saveur.We were meeting a long time friend there for lunch, and reaching just before they opened. Spartan greyish plain environment setting, creating a feel of 80s canteen style, though this results in the chairs making too much high pitch sounds when it is movedService to the table was ""spartan"" - maybe just waking up to the start of the day. Not much of a smile.Taking the set lunch, overall I would say the food is average to quite good, though it is dependent on what is ordered and your taste for the food - likely the reason for reviews that stretches from very good, satisfying, to bad, rubbish etc.With my lowered expectations, I would say overall is average, with definitely room for improvement, especially in terms of service, food quality, and presentation. Perhaps a 2nd visit will likely result in a more realistic review. At this point, I would just say it is somewhere you can go to if in need."
French,Saveur,Decent value and food,30,17 November 2015,"Decent value and food, good location. Nice place for a chat.
Not much else to say, certainly not 40 characters."
French,Saveur,Better second time round,30,30 October 2015,Didn't have a good first experience here. So was a bit apprehensive when I was invited to a private lunch event here. My apprehension was unfounded as it was a good lunch. Food was tasty & service was good. Will probably try it a third time. Hopefully it will be even better.
French,Saveur,Affordable and satisfying,40,14 October 2015,Went to have a nice dinner but there is no seat available at the moment. Reserve a table and within 10 mins received a sms notification that a table is ready. Food is nice and quite affordable. Will be back again soon
French,Saveur,Terrible,10,20 September 2015,The most terrible mushroom soup I ever had. It was worse than the can. It was like water. The standards dropped drastically.
French,Saveur,Inexpensive Italian yummy foods,40,11 September 2015,"I had make a reservation prior to dinner since is a Friday evening. The restaurant has a cool and young feel. I love the food and the portion is just nice for a small eater like me. I ordered the MUST TRY dish on the menu ""Duck Panzerotti"" ($14.90). The duck meat was wrap in moon shape pasta that looks like dumpling. On top of the pasta, was some sweet potato crisp. I love the salty taste dumpling but the sweet potato crisp was a bit too hard. My friend ordered the Crab Risotto ($12.90). I normally don't like t eat risotto but this was certainly good. The texture was just nice, not too creamy and very yummy. I would come back and try others dishes another day. But the service staffs was not very attentive."
French,Saveur,Canteen food for restaurant pricing...,20,22 June 2015,"I think there are only few restaurants in the world which I gave this title, but actually it reflects the true concept. Someone doing canteen food and sell it for restaurant pricing. Will not recommend or re-visit this place again ever."
French,Saveur,Sampling fine dining with low price,40,9 April 2015,Went there for a Sunday brunch with friends. I find that the menu price is very affordable but what surprises me more is that the palate leans towards French-Italian fine dining style. Service was average but that's because it was very busy. I would certainly come back again to try more from its menu.
French,Saveur,Petite portions,30,16 January 2015,Not bad a place if you are after petite portions at the prices offered at a no frills place for a variety of gourmet food. Service is quick and polite. You can see the action in the open kitchen. Water is served at 30 cents. The 4 minced pork ravioli portion is yummy. Crab risotto was bland. Not a place to hang around after your meal if you want to have a quiet cosy chat. 
French,Saveur,"Good food, reasonably priced.",40,20 December 2014,"Started by young chefs a few years out of culinary school, you can feel the energy of the place. The last time I was here, I had the beef which was good. This time, I tried the pork cheek with gnocchi, which is also good. Portions are not big but prices are reasonable. Worth going back again."
French,Saveur,Decent food for the price,30,13 December 2014,"They do dish up decent food for the price, especially in terms of presentation. The usual trade-off for the philosophy of good food at low prices is either quantity or quality. Concetto does well by its portions; however the quality is a little lacking for me.I tried the Grilled Octopus Caesar Salad, Buffalo Mozzarella, Beef Oyster Blade, and Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was amazing; everything else were subpar. I'm not expecting the world for their prices, but I do expect to have what I read on the menu. Concetto uses big words in their menu to mimic fine dining, but fail to deliver in the quality of their food.Good food does not need fancy ingredients. And with their Red Snapper I had a wonderful dish that used simple, fresh ingredients, combined with good cooking techniques. Stop playing with fancy names and instead use their culinary expertise to deliver delicious fine dining worthy food. I think that would make them really shine.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Concetto-by-Saveur/cmbz/F8F7B713-8333-4F47-A217-DF8074A26450"
French,Saveur,Don't waste your time at this terrible restaurant,10,3 November 2014,"The kitchen staff started taking off their aprons, which triggered us to follow up on our mains. We then saw them put on their aprons again and started cooking! When we asked the waiter if they had forgotten about our order and what turned us off is that he blatantly lied that the kitchen staff was very busy. Ya right. The food was a complete disappointment - the aglio tasted was soaked in oil and tasted salty, like everyone other dish that we ordered. The duck confit looked like a piece of overnight duck thrown into the microwave. This restaurant is a complete disaster and I totally regretted my visit into this nightmare restaurant wannabe. A far cry from Saveur, and a total disgrace. "
French,Saveur,Horrible Food and service!,10,8 October 2014,"Went to Concetto by Saveur thinking the standard is as good as its sister restaurant in Purvis street but I was totally WRONG! I had the seafood soup which was the only dish I think is quite good. For starter I had the saveur's signature pasta but compared to the restaurant at Purvis street this one was totally dry and tasteless! Next the Kurobuta pork cheek for my main course had this intense ""pork smell"" and it was so strong that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The duck confit which was ordered by my friend was also mediocre. The service was also below average I sat there for 15 mins waiting for friends to come and yet no service staff bother to ask if I needed a drink! Overall food and service suck!"
French,Saveur,Food was so-so,30,2 October 2014,"I headed to Concetto for dinner on a weekday night. Although I didn't have a reservation, a group of 2 can be seated pretty quickly. I tried the Tuna salad and the Duck Tortellini. This is my second time at Concetto but I still think that the food is only so-so and nothing to shout about. I think they're better with French food."
French,Saveur,Value For Money!,40,23 September 2014,Good location for great food at very affordable prices. Don't judge it by the exterior.I had the spring chicken dish with cognac cream sauce which was wonderful. It is amazingly easy to screw up chicken but my dish was succulent and tasty. Also paired it with a glass of acceptable white wine for $6 which was quite value for money. The food also came SWIFTLY which was a plus point!Seating was a little tight but was not too bad. Overall a good place for dinner! Would return when in town
French,Saveur,Good food at central location,40,2 September 2014,"Stumbled on this place for lunch on Saturday noon. Pleasant environment, food wise, most dishes were great. I had the squid ink risotto which was really good. The squid salad also very good. WIll give the prawn fettucine a miss next time as it turned out to be too similar to a local dish called ""mee pok"". Prices were reasonable and there's a promo for drinks when you get a main dish. Service was just ok. Will go there again only because the food is good."
French,Saveur,Risotto just the way I like it,40,5 August 2014,"I've come to Concetto twice for their mushroom risotto and have yet to find a risotto elsewhere that's to my liking as much as this place. At other restaurants, risotto if not done well can turn out soggy and bland but Concetto's version is perfectly al dente (is that the right term?) and wonderfully flavorful. Portions are not full-on American sized but I find that this way it leaves room to enjoy a starter and/or dessert. The deconstructed tiramisu is pretty awesome as well - although it did take us a few moments to adjust to the idea of not having a bowl or glass.Concetto is very popular, so it would be better if you made your reservation ahead of time so that you don't have to wait. Again, due to the popularity, you will feel rather 'hounded' - not by the waitstaff who are lovely and understanding, but by the many pairs of watching eyes of those waiting to be seated."
French,Saveur,Freshly made pasta,30,4 August 2014,"We happened to pass by and decided to pop in. Perhaps they were trying for a zen like place, with concrete benches and minimalist decor. The crowd was mostly in their 20s.Foodwise, we liked what we ordered. We started with the grilled octopus, with fennel leaves and lemon aioli. It was fresh and light. We also had the prawn aglio and the duck tortellini. The prawn pasta was good, with the right amount of spiciness and was not too oily. The tortellini was nice and not too firm, though I did think that some of the duck tasted a little strong and gamey. Overall, the dish was good.Portions are smallish, but prices were also reasonable. Service was friendly and quick.They also have a French bistro over at Far East, so do try that out too."
French,Saveur,It's heavenly!,50,13 July 2014,"It looks good, smells lovely and tastes heavenly! We popped in for lunch on a whim, when we had originally set out for ramen. However the tailback for the carpark at Bugis+ was atrocious so we zipped over to the Cathay instead.What a treat! The tuna pan seared was fabulous with its salad and sauces, as was the grilled octopus and bed of shredded fennel.The piece de resistance was without doubt the Wagyu Tender; done medium rare it melts in your mouth accompanied by the dulcit tones of the foie gras. The other main we had was the beef oyster blade. Very tender and beautifully seasoned and plated, it was of a standard that wouldn't be out of place in any of the other fine dining French establishments in town.Treat yourself, it's amazing! "
French,Saveur,What a treat!,40,26 June 2014,I have been to this place 2nd time around and I may say the food is delicious plate by plate it comes to beautifully presented and equally good tasting.affordable treat!
French,Saveur,Decent food at reasonable price,30,10 June 2014,"The menu is short and sweet.. there's a page of Pasta information, which is nice.. but what I don't understand why there is a choice of fresh and box pasta? Shouldn't you use fresh pasta all the time? if you're using box pasta, I think all of us can also make our own pasta dish at home. The dishes we ordered were bolognese and prawn aglio olio, both with fresh pasta. The bolognese was okay, I have had better, but the prawn aglio olio was delicious! I think it's an okay place if you're craving for some decent pasta.As for service, there's this one waitress who didn't smile at all.. There rest of them were quite friendly.. I would come back again to try other food there.."
French,Saveur,Unimpressive!!!,10,31 May 2014,"As much as we appreciate new trends in recipes and food presentation, we cannot lose track of the traditional ones.Some recipes just cannot be changed in the name of creativity.The spaghetti carbonara we had was atrociously un-Italian.What were they thinking?A version of Italian ""laksa""???Even the Bolignese tasted like a microwaveable TV dinner.Fresh ingredients please and keep it simple.Im sure freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano would be nice instead of pre- packed Kraft.And please inform your staff of the existence of pepperoncino a.k.a chilli flakes.This is plainly a fancy restaurant with sub-,standard food."
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner for 17 people,50,27 May 2014,"Amazing - even with a huge table , everything was great! The food the wine and the service! And so so reasonable priced! Thank you so much - do your self a favour and go!!!"
French,Saveur,fancy impression and it stops there,30,25 May 2014,"It looks modern and minimalist. It gives you the impression that this restaurant is laid back but fancy at the same time. But unfortunately, it stops there.You will be welcomed by a hi-tech seating reservation outside. It's a tablet wherein you have to leave your name and contact and it's suppose to give you a call when your table is ready. We decided to just stay nearby (a few steps outside the resto) but 20mins have passed and we're still waiting. We see people just walk-in and they got their seats immediately. We decided to talk to the guy manning the counter and he's at a lost on what to say and just told us to wait for 10 more mins. We're getting impatient but most of the restos in Cathay are packed so we decided to stay. Eventually, the call came and we we're seated.The menu is small and concise which is a good thing. You will not be overwhelmed with choices. The food is great. The portions/serving are neither here nor there. The service staff are a complete let down.Am I going back to this place? I really cannot decide but I'm inclined not to."
French,Saveur,"Small portions, reasonably priced",40,21 April 2014,"The six of us tried several starters (Earth) and several mains (both Land and Seas).All of us agreed the Grilled Octopus was good, while opinions were more divided on the Caesar and Tuna.The Creamy Pork was tender and tasty, although the pasta could be better. The Beef Oyster Blade was juicy and tender, and the Salmon nicely done. We were less enthusiastic about the risotto but the Funghi and Crab were both quite good.The portions are rather small, so it's a good idea to share a few starters, but prices are very reasonable and service is quite good.The restaurant gets crowded so reservations would be a good idea."
French,Saveur,Updating my previous review,40,7 April 2014,In my last review I mentioned that the service I received at Concetto in the early days of their opening was not very attentive. I still think that the food is fabulous and have yet to leave room for the great looking Tiramisu. However since I wrote my review I have learned that the owners intentionally hire front of the house staff who are new to the hospitality industry and provide them on the job training/experience. I think this is such a worthwhile effort that I wanted people to know and so I wrote this update.
French,Saveur,Good food with reasonable price,40,1 April 2014,"I was there with a group of friends on a Thursday night. Reservation is a must if you do not want to waste time waiting for a table. The restaurant was full on that day.As the portion was not big, each of us ordered a main course and some sides to share.We tried the grilled octopus, crab risotto, creamy pork, duck tortellini and tiramisu (the pistachio panna cotta was already sold out at 7pm!!). We enjoyed and liked all of them.Service was prompt and good. If you like simple restaurant with good food, this is the place."
French,Saveur,A nice simple menu with delicious options,30,3 March 2014,Concetto opened up in the former Billy Bomber location at The Cathay. Went there last night for the first time and was pleased with our dinner. I was expecting the wait-staff to come by after serving the food to inquiry about our meals but they did not so that was disappointing. That will come once the front of house staff learns to pay attention to customers. My advice to anyone planning to eat there is to save room for dessert. We didn't and I regret that as the Tiramisu looked fabulous.
French,Saveur,Great cooking with decent prices near orchard!,50,20 February 2014,"I was in Singapore recently for work and was asked to try out concetto. While it may look like the generic and very typical orchard fare, the food was far from it. The chefs hail from some of the best restaurants in the city like guy savoy, jaan and db. My brother and I tried the crab risotto, pork ravioli, mushroom risotto, and pistachio panna cotta. All for about sgd 58. The food was honest and just good cooking. A breath of fresh air."
French,L_Angelus,Memorable romantic restaurant with unexpected delightful cuisine and wine,40,11 October 2018,"I have since rebooked for our next trip to Singapore- it really feels like an authentic regional restaurant in France- totally unexpected. Excellent produce used in great dishes, with great service."
French,L_Angelus,"Delicious food with a great service, I felt like a princess!",50,13 July 2018,"A French restaurant in Singapore with this quality is something I’ve never seen before! It was an authentic french kitchen, like in the old days, amazing. The service was also really great! Compliments to the whole team, I enjoyed my evening! Thanks!"
French,L_Angelus,Eclectic French Cuisine ,50,28 August 2018,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend. The wine selection was phenomenal. The service was impeccable. The food Was delicious. Overall, when in Singapore, I would experience it again."
French,L_Angelus,One of my favorite French restaurants!,40,19 August 2018,"I have been a couple of times to this restaurant and I was happy with their food every time. Food was tasty and quite generous portion, specially cheese. There was a good selection of wine and reasonable price. Staff were polite and attentive. It was quite relaxed ambience too, one of my favorite French restaurants in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Never disappoints!,50,16 August 2018,"We go for special occasions, this was our silver wedding anniversary. We were offered complimentary champagne on arrival which was very thoughtful. We both had onion soup which was absolutely stunning. My wife had seabass and I had ribeye with gratin dauphinois and pepper sauce. We both had crepes suzette which were just gorgeous, every bite was so delicious. We finished with calcados and Amaretto.. A perfect evening with great service and warm ambiance. We'll be back many more times "
French,L_Angelus,Quality French restaurant ,40,2 August 2018,"If you are looking for good French food without burning a hole in the pocket, look no further. Located in the lively Club Street area, the restaurant is reminiscent of a typical quaint Paris restaurant. The quality of food was good as was the service."
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing for lunch,20,3 July 2018,Shockingly slow service for the set menu. Inexplicable. The food was half decent provided you could wait an hour for it to arrive. Many better places....
French,L_Angelus,Good French bistro dinner,50,30 June 2018,"Came here for my wife's birthday dinner, though we didn't tell the restaurant since she likes it low-key.We had- Mixed green salad with roquefort blue cheese and bacon- Pan-Fried Dover Sole, Butter Lemon Sauce, Steamed Potatoes- Cassoulet (Meats And Sausages, Served With Duck Confit And Pork Belly)- Hot Chocolate CakeMixed salad is good quality, though nothing spectacular. Nice Roquefort.The cassoulet is always my favourite, and it's enough to feed 2 persons (that's me). If you like baked beans, this would be for you. Doubly so if you like meats, as it as duck confit, pork belly and loads of sausages. 80% of the time it's done well, though on another occasion I felt that the meats were a bit tough.The dover sole was very good, though it never comes cheap (in any restaurant in Singapore). With the butter sauce it was fantastic.Chocolate cake nice enough, though I prefer the ""lava"" type where it oozes out instead of just being liquidy.All in all a very good meal again (though it would have been 4 stars during my second visit, per my earlier comment about the tougher meat in the cassoulet)."
French,L_Angelus,OK experience,30,24 June 2018,"Chose this place due to it's French atmosphere, which I find quite original. The rest was average, crowd started to build up after 8.30pm."
French,L_Angelus,Friday nights ! ,50,19 May 2018,"Not very often do you get Value & Authentic French food .. this place is a must try. From the wines to the food, & Desserts to the warm and happy hosts, it’s a place you will go back time and again!"
French,L_Angelus,White Asparagus ,50,24 April 2018,"Walked in for a business lunch, we got a good sized table. It had the upscale ambience that was conducive to good conversation. Had the snapper which was terrific. my friend was vegetarian and got a special menu which was a good suprise at a proper French restaurant. White asparagus was a delight.Great red wine list including some verticals, though being lunch we did not imbibe. Will be back"
French,L_Angelus,Charming French restaurant on Club Street!,50,31 March 2018,"What started off as a meeting place for a group of 4 couples, ended up being a fantastic evening in this charming restaurant. The entrance is quite charming but placid and doesn't quite prepare you for the interiors. As we entered, we were absolutely delighted with the warm interiors! The bar is quite close to the entrance which is presumably meant for patrons waiting to be seated, but we did see casual walk-ins as the evening progressed. We found their French wine collection to be very extensive! The posters on the walls also made the whole restaurant very warm and cosy.I think the complimentary warm bread rolls went down perfectly with the wine along with the butter that was served with it. The goat cheese salad deserves a special mention among the entree selections. In the mains, we shared the pan seared sea bass, pan fried Dover sole (both excellent!), marinated lamb racks (done to perfection as requested by one in our group), and the roasted chicken in a cream sauce was superb. One of our friends was vegetarian and they rustled up delightful plate of vegetables (see foto below).While we ordered both the creme brûlée and the Warm chocolate cake, it was really the chocolate one which was the winner! It was truly fabulous as they claim it to be."
French,L_Angelus,Best French meal in Singapore,50,31 March 2018,"Went for dinner to L”Angelus and came away in love with the ambiance, service, wine and lip smacking delicious food . When you enter through the doors you feel transported to a Parisian Cafe in Paris. The decor is very warm and inviting and David who runs the place immediately makes you feel at home. I had the pate as my starter, Dover sole as my main course and their warm chocolate lava cake ( the first one in Singapore apparently) all were beyond delicious. Even the butter they serve is awesome. I would def visit as there is a reason this restaurant which is the first French restaurant in Singapore is still in business and doing so well. "
French,L_Angelus,Fabulous little French restaurant,40,14 January 2018,We had dinner here on 2 of our 4 nights in Singapore. Excellent menu with just enough variety to the fixed menu (5 options for each serving) at an excellent $68 each. Entree options were excellent with a special mention to the goat cheese salad. Yummy.Tuna steaks with sesame seed coating were our favourite main though the second night they were a bit cool.Dessert was fabulous and the bread as it should be in a French restaurant was superb.All up a lovely restaurant and well worth a visit.
French,L_Angelus,Nice evening,50,6 November 2017,"As we walked along Club street looking for a place to have dinner - we ended up at the porch at L'Angelus - eating a delicious french meal - instead of a nice Chinese dinner - as we had planned to do. They served us a delicious sole meuniere - (not even on the menu...) - - and the wine list was impressive.The guests at the neighbouring table were locals - and admitted they ate at the L'Angelus quite often - as one of their favourite restaurants in Singapore. We understand why...( service very friendly - and a very ""french"" interior - if that matters..)"
French,L_Angelus,"competitively priced lunch menu, food OK-lah",30,7 September 2017,"+ SGD 39 for a three course set lunch incl coffe in the CBD is a good, competitive offer. + restaurant is decorated bistro-style in a renovated shop house.+ service is friendly and attentive- cold cut starter plate: good variety, but why do I need to visit a restaurant to just get sliced meat without any salad, or pate or something special?- steak: very strange texture, felt a bit like soaked in meat softener, somehow real beef texture missing- potatoes: not cooked enough- crème brule: felt like being ""sitting"" in the fridge for a very long time- only two tables busy ...would I go again? NOPE, simply too much choice around the corner"
French,L_Angelus,Classic French Cuisiine,50,6 September 2017,"An institution of Singapore
We went for the steak tartare and were not disappointed
The restaurant was quiet but is was Tuesday night
Well worth a visit when in Singapore"
French,L_Angelus,Walk in dinner,20,21 August 2017,"First of all, the food was good but the service from the female petite manager was really below average. This is my first time having a meal in a local restaurant that i felt i was actually in a foreigner country. Is kind of disappointing that it happened in our own country and is not surprised that the manager is actually a Singapore citizen herself. She has an attitude problem and the best part is towards her own people."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent lunch menu !,50,18 August 2017,"Went back to this little French place in Chinatown . They have now a lunch set quite nice for the price .36$. Got a cold cut platter , a nice steak, a creme brûlée and coffee . What else can you expect ? Superb . Great service too . "
French,L_Angelus,Good set menu,40,15 July 2017,"Place to go if you are very hungry
Go for the set menu at dinner time, terrine was perfect
Good wine list and service
You can eat outside or inside"
French,L_Angelus,Impressive,50,18 June 2017,"This restaurant is one with a long history on Club Street. Deservedly so. Good service. Flawless home made pate. An interesting amuse bouche, tasty! And well cooked steaks to order, both cuts explained by the waitress. Service was attentive as we'd come to expect from a previous visit or two. We started on the terrace this time to enjoy the sights of the street. Before mains we asked to move inside because a bar nearby decided to go heavy metal at 7.30pm. Despite the restaurant being near full, this was handled seamlessly. Glad we got to experience the ambience inside. Lovely. A well run, well respected restaurant. "
French,L_Angelus,The Only French Restaurant in Singapore for us!,50,3 June 2017,"My daughter grew up in Switzerland near the French border and to her, there is nothing better than authentic French food. So to celebrate her graduation last night, out of all the restaurants in Singapore, L'Angelus was her choice. Never disappointing, simply great French food in a lovely fine dining atmosphere. And they now have a $68 three course menu that has a great selection. If we hadn't gone with our favorite menu items in mind we would have been tempted but we stayed with our favorites: duck liver pate, duck liver grilled and the Chicken Fricassee in a morel and truffle sauce (the recipe's on their website) which is to die for. For dessert, my daughter had her favorite hot chocolate cake with their luscious vanilla ice cream. One more thing, I'm on a low-carb diet (no sugar) and found the menu filled with possible options. But just to make sure, my waitress went to the kitchen and came back with a list of the best of all choices. An unbelievably gourmet meal which also didn't derail me off my diet? At L'Angelus, what's not to like?"
French,L_Angelus,Top French style brasserie/restaurant,50,25 April 2017,"We had dinner with 5 people. The food was delicious. Could not fault anything. The foie gras was fantastic. Reasonable prices for the wines considering the import duties charged in Singapore. Only remark is that our waiter needs some more training.The Aperol Spitzer is good, very good. Highly recommend it"
French,L_Angelus,Happy Experience,50,14 April 2017,"Stopped by late one evening without a reservation and, to our surprise, was given a table and served great food. We both had the set dinner in this classic French restaurant. The onion soup was just right - a bit of cheese and crouton in a very nice and very-full-of-onions broth. The tuna tataki with sesame was perfectly done and my wife's cassoulet was just delicious with enough to take some home with us. They offer a wide selection of wines and the wait staff understand how to recommend them. The creme brûlée was perfect as was the service through the meal. It's a bit pricy but that's common for Singapore. If you like classic French food we'd highly recommend L'ANGELUS."
French,L_Angelus,Absolutely Phenomenal Restaurant.,50,24 March 2017,"The food in L'Angelus is absolutely phenomenal. Great restaurant with really good flower decoration from outside view. The service was excellent and the Chinese lady who is serving is the friendliest and most professional i ever seen in any Singaporean restaurant. I ordered as appetizer the Roasted Chavignol Goat Cheese and Salad on Walnut Bread Toasts and it was 'WOW'.As mains , i ordered Marinated Lamb Racks , Ratatouille and Mashed Purple Potatoes and Lamb it melts in the mouth. Really a great chef.So far , this is the best french restaurant i ever been in my life.Dinner 23.3.2017"
French,L_Angelus,Nice and quiet environement in a French traditional deco.,40,17 March 2017,"Very good food for value. Traditional French plates.
The food menu is not taking you too long to read and choose so it is appreciable especially when what ever you take, you will be satisfy by the food."
French,L_Angelus,Solid french food,40,24 February 2017,"Good french place on Club street, it is an institution, has been here for ages. I liked the meat selection. Great wine also, though they know how to charge."
French,L_Angelus,Fantastic French restaurant served excellent steak,50,16 February 2017,"I was there with my wife to celebrate Valentine's Day. The place is wonderful, they pay attention to the detail from decoration in the restaurant and washroom, to the tableware on the table. The waiter and waitress are very friendly and served us very well. We ordered French onion soup, escargot, ribeye steak and Profiterolles glacées au chocolat. The escargot served in individual clay pot with a piece of toasted bread on top and that's my first time eating it this way and it's lovely and tastefully. We shared the French onion soup which is just right for both of us. The Rib eye steak served with layered potato gratin and they tasted wonderful. The serving is big and we were so full after the main course but we don't wish to miss the dessert. They displaced the Profiterolles glacées au chocolat nicely on the plate and we were in heaven. It tasted so good that we want another plate, may be next time because we were so full. We had a wonderful evening and we definitely will visit again. "
French,L_Angelus,20th birthday,20,27 November 2016,"We went to l’Angelus to celebrate our son’s 20th birthday.I mentioned to a colleague of mine that we would be going there on November 26. He told me that he had been disappointed the last time he went there for dinner and he would be interested in getting my feedback.The starters were ok, 2 x escargots, 1 salad and 1 duck foie gras. Mind you, it is not very complicated. A good oven for the escargots and a good knife for the salad and for the foie gras.As a main course we ordered Chateaubriand, Bar and a Wagyu steak. The meat of the Chateaubriand was ok. We had to wait a few minutes for the gratin dauphinois. Needless to say that the meat was getting cold while waiting. When the gratin arrived, it came as a rectangular kind of a brick, coming straight from the deep freezer. Unfortunately, it did not stay long enough in the micro wave as the middle of it was still very cold.My daughter went for the beef. Again, a disappointment, the meat was chewy but the French fries were good. At least they were not cold and were served together with the meat.My wife took the bar. It could have been any fish as the taste was covered by the sauce. Not impressive at all.We did not take any dessert.One thing that was very disappointing was the service. No smiling faces. The service need to improve a lot, not friendly and not efficient. There were only 4 tables with customers.We had been there many times but last night was our last one."
French,L_Angelus,Business lunch ,30,12 November 2016,"Friday lunch and if this is always on the agenda.
Good French menu and awesome wine list at reasonable prices.
We both ordered steak frites with rib eye. It was good not great for once something was missing."
French,L_Angelus,Fantastic food,40,6 November 2016,Had dinner here with a mix of colleagues and friends while on business trip. Food was very good as well as the wine. Service was good and friendly. The dishes were very large and may be reduced in size. We were not able to have dessert because of the size of starter and main.
French,L_Angelus,Great food that is almost worth the wait,30,5 November 2016,"L'Angelus rightly has a great reputation for its excellent French food and is located in the lively Club Street. But our evening was undermined by snail-paced service. We started with the incredible mushroom soup, the fois gras and terrine, all served in a reasonable time. Then we had to wait well over an hour for our main courses. When they arrived, they were excellent: duck, beef and lamb. We complained about the wait and management assured us that this was unusual and because they were short-staffed, and offered us a complimentary drink. One of our party said that they had experienced something similar before, so I would definitely recommend the food but only if you have superhuman patience."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent - highly recommend,50,25 October 2016,"Came to this fantastic restaurant for a friends birthday party, the food was sensational, the service and ambiance was excellent, everyone had a great time, highly recommend this restaurant when in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent quality but expensive!,40,24 October 2016,"We have visited L'Angelus during Singapore residence and visits over several years and have always been pleased with the ambience and quality. Noted on this occasion, on a busy Friday night night in Club Street, that it was very quiet and was surprised how high the prices were for even the house wine - significantly above other local establishments. Quality was still good and we enjoyed our meal."
French,L_Angelus,Just ok,30,11 September 2016,"Ok place, seating outside, noisy with uk football from the bar next door, friendly service, food average really for such a long time established place. Much prefer Les Bouchons just next door. Same owner, just better."
French,L_Angelus,Very good and authentic French ,50,9 September 2016,"I discovered this French bistro invited for business lunch . I was pleasantly surprised . The food is not only excellent but also very well done . Guess the chef must be French or at least trained in France ! Some interesting touch of originality here and there ( a nice variation on "" bavette"" with a kind of coriander lemon condiment ) but great classics like cassoulet or roasted lamb with an exceptional ratatouille ( I love ratatouille, this one was great ). Dessert are well done and elegant on the plate . Another thing I liked was the wine list , good choice with some rare bottles, mainly Bordeaux old vintages , very decent in price . Speaking of price , they have a 68$ menu , the one I had , quite decent for Singapore if you check the quality . Bravo !"
French,L_Angelus,Authentic French style bistro,40,6 September 2016,"Have been dining here regularly for over 5 years. Nice "" French"" décor and atmosphere. Food and menu has improved recently. The Veal chop is huge, and very tasty. Remains traditionally French, as is the wine list. The wine list is on the expensive side. Closer to fine dining prices in a bistro environment. The restaurant manager is friendly and attentive, particularly to "" regular"" clients."
French,L_Angelus,Beautiful evening in a real French! Not so expensive,50,2 September 2016,"Went to this restaurant following advice from hotel concierge . He told me it was one of the oldest French in town, a bit on the expensive side . But I was pleasantly surprised as they have a fantastic menu for a reasonable price ( around 68 $ if I am not wrong). They are celebrating 18 years in Singapore . Well, I had a very good chicken liver terrine , as good as in some high end bistro in Paris and my friend tried the snails who were to die for ! My main was a very good lamb, juicy tender rack perfectly cooked with a very very good ratatouille . My friend had the duck, a farm one, very tasty. Excellent dessert ( I had their hot chocolate cake, it's a very good one !). They gave good wines too and I understood from the manager lady they import most of them so pricing is very decent for Singapore . We got a bottle of a wine from south of France , Les Brunes , a kind of boutique wine that was superb and only 98$. Good value for money all in one . Honestly, I felt like in Paris in a very good bistro . Service is ok. Great place, good value. I recommend ."
French,L_Angelus,Expensive for average food,30,16 July 2016,"Yet another French style 'bistro'. The interior is nice and ""chic"" and typically French. They have quite and extensive menu and wine list. The food was good (but very expensive) and well presented. Service is average. Overall I would say its a decent restaurant but over-priced. It seems to be the norm in Singapore that a lot of restaurants that provide average food and service feel the need to over charge in order to somehow give the impression that they better than what they are. "
French,L_Angelus,Still good after all these years..,40,19 June 2016,I have been dining at this joint for over a decade and for some reason I still find it appealing though the price is on the high side but that's fine. So much for the recent feedbacks posted...one word cynical but then again to each his/her own.My all time favourites..foie gras...escargots...duck confit and their fish dishes. Will definitely be back always...
French,L_Angelus,Good Food & Good Service!,40,23 May 2016,"Been a few times and its just as good as the first time I visited. Nice size portions, tasty food, good service, & nice ambiance. Perfect place for a great meal! ! Oysters are always fresh & escargots are divine! Of all the french restaurants I have been to in Singapore, I will say this is my favorite!"
French,L_Angelus,"Good food, well done",40,31 March 2016,"Set up brasserie style, it's a good solid menu of traditional french favorites. Prices are a little steep, but the quality is evident from the moment you arrive. Foie Gras perfectly done, an amazing veal chop and a good solid wine list to choose from. Great cheese selection as well. Happy to recommend. "
French,L_Angelus,Truly good French restaurant,40,29 March 2016,"A Singaporean friend assured us this was the best French restaurant in Singapore and after living in France for 30 years I must agree. The foie gras either as pate or pan seared is exceptional, the mains were all good and the molten chocolate cake with ice cream a treat. Particular kudos for the strawberry ice cream dessert. Lovely decor, good service. "
French,L_Angelus,"Awesome food, unpretentious plating",40,16 February 2016,"Quality food comes in generous portions and unpretentious plating. The seared scallop with squid and pumkin soup were excellent; so was the delightful beef steak. The hot chocolate cake was to die for, while the plate of 10 assorted cheeses was delightful."
French,L_Angelus,Unsatisfying,30,13 February 2016,"For a French restaurant, nothing could be more insulting than to be told your experience was unsatisfying, but that's exactly how we finished this dinner feeling. Had to leave for airport at 9:30 so wanted a great ""last night"" meal and cancelled Morton's to go here instead. Wrong move. I'm an Francophile so know my French cuisine very well and whilst the menu is French classics in theory, it's sadly not in practice. As another reviewer noted ""not the French flavor"".Got there around 6:45 and instead of sitting us at a table and offering a Kir, sent us away with ""we don't open until 7:00pm"" so we found a bar across the road and duly waited. Bread was great, good start. Pan fried fois gras good, but the product speaks for itself. Onion soup reasonable, not the best, but not the worst, and as my husband makes a great one with home made veal stock, it's unfair to compare. Main course, tartare and onglet (blue) with french fries, that were not really French fries. Too thick. Tartare was OK, a standard tartare and expectations were met, but no ""wow"" factor. The onglet was off - it tasted and smelt odd. You begin to doubt yourself initially because after all, this is a good restaurant n'est pas? It was red, and looked OK, but there was this distinctive odor and taste. I gave my husband a mouthful, he said straight away, ""no, that's not right"". It was left. When they asked what was wrong I asked them to ask the Chef what he thought about the steak. They returned and said ""that's what a blue steak tastes like"". I've been eating my steak blue all my life, even before I lived in France, so I know what it should taste like. I love my food and eat absolutely everything, and could count on one hand food that I rejected. This was one of them.I wasn't offered the choice to order something else at the time, but noted it was not charged on the bill, which was appropriate. We had lava cake and creme caramel, both average. I was told this was run by a Frenchman, but he was nowhere to be seen front of house or in the kitchen on a Friday night. Wait staff were attentive, but Chinese chefs cooking French cuisine is akin to French chefs cooking chinese food. It simply won't taste authentic. Wine list is expensive, a carafe of wine whilst good is $60+"
French,L_Angelus,"Really disappointing, not worth the value...",20,17 January 2016,"Really disappointing by our dining experience at l Angelus. Poor food, not the French flavour. The Saint Jacques and calamar as a main was a pure joke, not well cooked, and ridiculously small. 50SGD for this dish is a real joke. No problem to pay more in Singapore but not for this. The creme brulee was just decent. The wine was nice... Will definitely not come again..."
French,L_Angelus,Authentic French Brasserie,50,7 December 2015,"Simply excellent food, Foie gras terrine and beef steak are a must try. Great wine list too. The service is impeccable, not intrusive and very professional.Located in Club Street, a very lively street at night. Highly recommend for people seeking for other flavours when in Singapore"
French,L_Angelus,Real French Brasserie,40,12 November 2015,"From trying many french restaurants throughout Singapore, there are many places that try to give a french flavor to their atmosphere and menu, but L'Angelus is truly the best for a real brasserie experience -- great foie gras (in several styles), an excellent selection of both entrees and mains, plus a variety of the traditional desserts (with nice new touches). All in all a good experience for a traditional french meal at a high quality but not fine-dining level."
French,L_Angelus,A little taste of France,40,10 November 2015,"Out and about with mates on Club Street, we all fancied a taste of France for dinner. With no booking, we were seated easily. Service is a little stand off-ish. The staff appear to lack confidence, though were very congenial. A little tinkering, and this could make the difference of this restaurant going from good to great. In terms of the food, it was really very good. We shared pate and escargot to start. A table of 5 and only 3 pieces of bread and 9 escargot. A little proactivity here could make a huge difference. At the time of ordering, if we were offered 10 escargot for additional cost, we would have opted in. We had to ask for additional bread, also. Despite this, I could not fault the food itself. Delicious. Steak was a popular choice at our table and each were cooked to medium-rare perfection. Of particular note, the Tartare was terrific. Assembled and prepared at the table, it was pure food theatre. Delightful.A good wine cellar in the house, we were pleased with the wines. "
French,L_Angelus,Thank god for this little gem,40,10 November 2015,"It used to bother me that L'angelus hardly ever updated their menu; however, over the years I've come to appreciate that sometimes you just want a perfect elegant little bistro like L'Angelus that hardly ever changes. The foie gras is perfect, the confit of duck delicious and the wine list is very accessible. My only complaint is that the fries that come with the confit are a little soggy. Nevertheless, when I want classic relaxing French in a sophisticated setting, this place is always on my short list. "
French,L_Angelus,Exquisite and tasty French meal ,50,20 September 2015,"Went with friends on two separate occasions, love foie gras so thought to give this French restaurant a try despite previous reviews. Talking to the staff, they had very recently undergone a change in the kitchen. Incoming Chef Reynaldo recommended the presse foie gras to begin with, the balance of sweetness and the savouriness was perfect. For our main, 2 of us had the Chateaubriande steak (portion was filling for 2) which was served with the very tasty potato gratin is a must try, codfish with cream sauce, sea bass was very fresh and tasty. For desert, we had the dark chocolate lava cake and poached pear. Dark chocolate is good, poached pear had a creamy center which is a pleasant surprise. Overall, you will not be disappointed. Ask the friendly staff and manager jasmine for recommendations and they are always willing to help.Regarding the the lack of pictures, we finished the dishes so quickly cause they were so tasty. When we remembered, only dessert was left. Will definitely be back. "
French,L_Angelus,One of these very good traditional French restaurants,50,14 September 2015,"I haven't been here for years. And what a pleasure to be back. Never mind the restaurant did not upgrade its interior, as that is part of the charm.Excellent service! Seating is comfortable with even a possibility to eat on the veranda or outside on the street (when the road is closed off)Very good choice from a menu which stretches the entire variety of the traditional French kitchen. Portions are generous, which forced me to let go the very good looking choice of cheese."
French,L_Angelus,Real French taste ,40,11 September 2015,I was not joining the business dinner very happily : a French restaurant in Singapore when I dreamed of street food..... But I must recognise it is real and tastes real. Good place to eat real bistro food if you wish so .
French,L_Angelus,"Cosy, elegant dining experience with top notch food",50,19 August 2015,"Went there for dinner after being recommended by my good friend who knows that i adore french food.Was recommended by the chef, Reynaldo, his signature foie gras salad, along with seabass and wagyu steak.The salad was very well prepared and well balanced and the mains were delicately prepared. Perhaps this represents being able to ""taste passion"".Could tell that the food were prepared with passion and skill.Paired it with a red wine recommended by the manager and it complemented the food very well.Recommend this place for a nice dinner with your date or with friends for a quality dinner along with a comfortable and classy atmosphere.Oh one more thing to add, the creme brulee was fantastic as well!"
French,L_Angelus,Expensive La ..! Disappointing ...,30,30 July 2015,"Heard a lot about that restaurant, so was looking forward to it. Let's set the service aside : the service was good. Friendly waiters and waitresses. The decor was good as well ..nice posters on the wall, high ceilings and good A/C. But the food and the prices were a major let down. 115 Sing dollars for the meal was poor value for escargots / snails and Tartare plus mediocre chateauneuf 2012 .. I was chocked by the wine list and prices...a Cote du Rhone Basic Guigal at 88 Sing is excessive. Simple average burgundies above 110 Sing ..are simply bad value. The snails were swimming in butter sauce - strange recipe - not what you get in France. Average Steak Tartare . All of It ..disappointing."
French,L_Angelus,Living on its reputation 2!,30,30 July 2015,"Yeap, i do agree with fraser115.I used to like the place but after my last visit, i say: never again!I think the same girl manager served us and yes, she does not accept any criticism!And the best is she called the boss....he is worse than her...no comments!"
French,L_Angelus,nice & cosy set-up,30,22 July 2015,"food is ok, we ordered chateaubriand doneness to ' A point ' as requested by my sister. good!
good selection of wine. Cosy ambience, we like it, unfortunately, service staff are not great."
French,L_Angelus,Fab French in the Tropics,40,6 June 2015,"A light lunch with a friend on a quiet Monday.What better place in Singapore than on Club Street as it starts to wake from the night before, at that perennial bistro, L'Angelus.The décor is traditionally Parisian bistro.The music is Piaf or some other husky throated Gallic warbler!The service is prompt.The food is delicious - a beautifully cooked salmon in a bag with a glass of Provencal RoseExcellent bistro to wind away a few hours or one short one over great, freshly cooked food!"
French,L_Angelus,Living on its reputation!,20,23 March 2015,"No restaurant can afford to rest on its laurels and unfortunately, that is precisely what this one is doing. The restaurant occupies a position in the centre of Club Street that after 7pm at the weekend becomes one of the hippest areas of the city. When we entered this quaint French Bistro style restaurant we left our entire feel good factor on the pavement of Club Street as the restaurant was completely lacking in atmosphere. There was very little energy among the staff and it felt boring. The standard of cooking was mixed; the starters were good however both the Duck Confit and the Sausage Cassoulet were overcooked. I expected a melt-in-the-mouth duck confit with succulent meat encased in a crispy skin instead; I received overcooked dry and chewy duck - dreadful! After waiting fifteen minutes for our plates to be removed, the waitress came to top up our wine glasses and we had to ask for our table to be cleared. We said the food was overcooked but the waitress, whom we discovered was the manager, would not accept any criticism. We asked for the bill and when paying we were saying we were disappointed with both the food and the service. However, the worst service was yet to come as I had to ask the waitress (manager!) to stop clearing the table next to us when my husband was paying the bill and she was still talking to him - absolutely appalling service! The staff appears to have forgotten that they are actually there to serve the customer. Club Street has so much more to offer than this."
French,L_Angelus,Authentic experience of a French Bistro,40,8 March 2015,"OK, so the staff may be a little formal, but they all speak French and a healthy number of their patrons were French speaking when my wife and I visited. So, give your French a try! Atmosphere was very authentic, but a bit more swish than a typical Parisian bistro and far more room. We had a bit of a hiccup with my wife's entree, when 45 minutes after ordering we were told that it was off the menu. However, the remainder of the meal went very smoothly and they did the right thing (my wife's replacement entree turned out to be complimentary). I had the warm goats cheese for entree, whilst my wife had a pate: both really excellent. My main meal was duck with figs: outstanding. My wife had entrecôte steak: cooked 'a point' as ordered, but quality of beef a little lacking. Superb wine list, with prices upwards of $88 (plus the irritating""++""). Definitely worth another visit."
French,L_Angelus,A truly French experience in Singapore!,40,4 March 2015,"We had a brilliant meal here at the beginning of February. We found the setting and atmosphere of the place to be sufficiently French to make us forget we were not in Paris. The food and wines were of a very high quality. The service was also very French, i.e. somewhat stiff and formal (what a shame they're too proud to learn from the Italians!).If you are in Singapore and are looking for a proper ""French"" restaurant, then look no further than l'Angelus. It is extremely good – but be careful, the bill may be larger than you were expecting."
French,L_Angelus,Little charming French bistro in the heart of Chinatown's Club street area,40,1 January 2015,"Great little place with extensive French wines by the bottle or glass at reasonable prices. Charming rustic decor a la Francaise and simple but delicious menu offering items such as Croque Monsieur, goats cheese tart, Croque Carillon (goats chees and bacon), lovely assortment of cheeses - small or larger plate -, crusty French breads, generous salads with mustard vinaigrette etc. etc to name but a few. There's also a very good rillette and foie gras in offer.French magazines are readily available - they are mostly recent too!Downstairs lounge area is also available for larger groups with a pool table for those interested. One of my favorite spots in this area - just wish the French owner wouldn't look so serious and perhaps give his customers a smile now and then ;-)"
French,L_Angelus,Excellent...,50,28 December 2014,"Been many times but not for a few years and it did not disappoint. Walked in and it was very familiar surroundings and I immediately felt relaxed and ready for some classic French fare. Started with foie gras simply prepared but with decadence. Next was a bavette steak full of flavour, topped with shallots and accompanied with very crispy straw fries, yumm. To finish the theatrical crepe suzzette done table side. Wine is typical singapore prices but the range and quality are always there in the L'Angelus group. A great meal, well prepared with great service. Worth a try. "
French,L_Angelus,Great quality food but lousy service,30,26 November 2014,"Had a wonderful meal at this restaurant however the service was absolutely lousy, and we were often waiting to be served.The waitress never smiled once, simply put the customer last and made no effort to build up a rapport so we did'nt feel welcomed whatsoever. It was clear that she did'nt want to be working there.I found the food to be over-priced however I'm not upto date with the prices within Singapore so be aware of that.There are certainly better restaurants on Club St with staff who actually want you in their restaurant, go elsewhere instead !"
French,L_Angelus,I do not understand some commentaries,50,21 November 2014,I had a wonderfull evening excellent red wine with perfect temperature. Escargots and cote de veau perfect. Service. Very good. I can really recommend this place.
French,L_Angelus,Perfect comfort food for small groups,40,25 September 2014,"I read some of the negative reviews and feel compelled to offer a different view. If one is looking for a perfect romantic dinner for two, perhaps this is not the place. However, if you are looking for and old fashioned brasserie with standard french comfort food that can accommodate a group of say 6,8, or 10, then L'Angelus is the perfect alternative. I was there last week with a group of 10 and there were no complaints. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges and the menu hasn't changed in years, but two or three times a year it's the perfect alternative to all the newcomers. I love the place and save it for such occasions. "
French,L_Angelus,"Charming, Cozy and Welcoming",50,29 August 2014,"The first time I went here was when my friends arranged my birthday dinner here, it was kind of a surprise, and a very pleasant one. From then ive been here quite often, and it’s a perfect place if your would just want to relax, enjoy your meal have a nice conversation. If your alone, just hop on the bar stool, and the staff is kind enough to give you company, also introduce you to regulars around. The ambiance at L'Angelus is perfect for a large group to talk without having to scream over the table and its even better for a quite romantic dinner for two. The food is delicious, I love their desserts…. (There have been time Ive stopped by just for it)The staff is kind and friendly and they make you feel comfortable, from helping you with suggestions, to short conversations while you’re waiting. I'm definitely coming back more often :)"
French,L_Angelus,"Appalled, totally appalled",10,26 August 2014,"While I tried very hard to maintain my virtue, every single aspect of this restaurant was appalling and I could not help but to find myself in negative territory.As this was the first time I had returned to this restaurant in 6 years, perhaps it was naive of me to expect the standard was still upholding.The quality of food, presentation, staff's attention, menu, service standard, everything was absolutely disgusting. I requested my steak to be medium to well-done, and it came out raw in the middle with dripping blood.Plus the meat tasted weird. It wasn't a high quality meat.My shoe string fries looked like a jumbled up wire that didn't resemble anything of a potato, but soaked in greasy oil.The onion soup was disgusting. The french toast on top was already soggy and there was no flavor.The price of lunch wasn't whopping, but if we'd pay $80 a head for LUNCH, we'd at least expect our steak to be done properly as per request.Overall, there were staff hanging around, not particulary doing anything but gawking and glaring at my female client who was Asian in an extremely inappropriate, indecent manner.Entirely embarrassed that I even considered this restaurant to be the venue for my important lunch meeting. Never ever again, will I ever visit this restaurant."
French,L_Angelus,Better service then rumored,50,7 August 2014,"We were invited to this restaurant by a collegue who lives here. Wether you choose this restaurant or another, this area is vibrant and lively. In the weekends they close off the streets from car traffic and the restaurants expand their premises to include the street as well. A beautiful area neighborhood with two story buildings called shop houses. Our friend said early that the food is among the best but the service can be up and down. On our visit - it was impeccable. When looking for a champagne we were offered to try a glass before ordering a bottle. We ha the sea bass tartar and escargot as starters and the veal for main. It all tasted superb. And for wine aficionados they had a very nice collection to try from. Bottom line - I have read the other reviews but our experience was top notch."
French,L_Angelus,"bad service, food decent.",20,21 July 2014,"Went there last Sat for dinner. Had a really bad start with a waitress and owner. there was a bug on the menu, and we casually mentioned it to waitress. Her response was ""it's just a little bug"". For a restaurant, dont think that's acceptable. Owner came by, and was unapologetic. Said something like ""do you think that's an issue?"". Also, asked for an extra chair for some bags. Was turned down curtly by same waitress and without much attempt or sincerity. (the other waiters were great though)Finally, asked to change a waitress. Food was ok, but honestly will not recommend nor return. Perhaps it's because we're a table of locals, but we were definitely not accorded fair respect."
French,L_Angelus,Great food,40,1 June 2014,"I have visited L'Angelus a number of times for dinner and even went there to celebrate dinner after my marriage registry.Every time the food is great, from the fish to the succulent steak and wonderful sides. Value-wise it's about what you would expect from a quality steak place on Club Street.The atmosphere is always lively too and the decor is pretty cool with old school posters covering the walls. It's a busy place and would recommend reserving a table.Highly recommended."
French,L_Angelus,An oldy but a goody,40,15 May 2014,"I hadn't been to L'Angelus in years I have to say but having been back I have since been back again.L'Angelus does simple things well and in an entirely unfussy way whilst making you feel that everything is in it's proper place.Portions are more than ample, the wine list is adequate if not entirely thorough and service is brisk but efficient and knowledgable. There are more modern alternatives but for straightforward French fare, L'Angelus ticks the boxes."
French,L_Angelus,Worst Service Ever,10,11 May 2014,"Worst service I've ever had in my life. Took us 2.5 hours to have dinner. Had to ask for drinks 3 times and go inside to bring out ourselves in the end.Owner was rude when asking we complained, saying write a letter to the ministry of manpower about the bad service.Food was average at best.Wouldn't go back if you paid me."
French,L_Angelus,What a joke...,10,26 April 2014,"We are French, leaving in Spore since 5 years. We've tried many French restaurants, L' Angelus has been the most disappointing ever. Given the prices, compare to Le Gavroche or Le Bistrot du Sommelier, our expectations were quite high.Service really bad, attitude was good but due to lack of people we had to keep asking for water, napkin, had to go ask directly at the counter inside if we could get some ice water etc.Fish tartare was ok, then we had cassoulet and duck confit (south west French dishes), come on guys!! charging 40+ for what we had, are you joking? The confit was poor, oily, meat was dry, the cassoulet was blend. Honestly? You must change your chef. Last but not least they did a mistake on the bill, we got the bill from another table... Much higher... Glad we've checked. So sorry to write such a bad review. To end on a positive note I must say the house wine was good. "
French,L_Angelus,Fine French Food in the tropics,40,11 April 2014,"This restaurant was an unexpected treat, an authentic feeling French restaurant in the heart of Singapore. We dined mid-week and were shown to a table straight away without having made a reservation.The menu was traditional and covered a lot of ground, with plenty of options in both the starters and main courses.We both ordered duck, a confit and roasted breast, which in both cases was beautifully prepared. The food was fabulous but remember to order a side dish if you want vegetables. The cheese course was a stand out, beautifully ripe and served at the right temperature with plenty of bread. For us the main and cheese plate was more than satisfying, although the desserts sounded wonderful too.The prices are high but this is Singapore so to be expected and you do get a good meal and service.We were even treated to an extra glass of wine at the end of our meal by the delightful French manager.One gripe, and it is a general one rather than specific to this restaurant: why can't the prices on the menu include the taxes and charges? We have to pay them anyway and having the total cost would be more honest."
French,L_Angelus,A delightful French restaurant,40,10 April 2014,Dining in Singapore can often be a bland formulaic driven experience with restaurateurs driven by a desire to “produce” a cuisine and experience with matching designer driven décor and furniture. Not here. The food and wine shows a real level of care and is drawn from more than one French department. The manager was an informed and helpful sommelier with considered and constructive advice including good selections that matched our chosen desserts perfectly. He also checked on the service and food we received several times. I will return.
French,L_Angelus,Sadly It's gone downhill since we were last here,30,31 March 2014,We used to enjoy coming here when we lived in Singapore and so wanted to introduce a friend. We were slightly disappointed with the service. Apparently they are trying to find more staff but it does spoil the meal slightly as the point of going to a restaurant is partly they you want to be served ! They had only one bottle of the champagne we ordered and also only one bottle of the red wine we chose. Dinner was steaks as this is what we remembered them doing well and they were good. As we had expected. Desserts on the other hand were a big disappointment. We ordered crapes Suzette and were optimistic when we saw they would be prepared at the table... The crepes themselves were already cooked. They were just put in the pan and sauce was added.... They were heavy and doughy not light and crispy and all the sauce did was to turn them into a soggy doughy mess. Had I been told that these were shop bought pre made pancakes I certainly would not be surprised.
French,L_Angelus,Double check your bill!,20,15 March 2014,I used to love this place. Until this time when I checked my bill and realized they completely overcharged us for the wrong bottle and the wrong number of bottles of wine. The service was already appalling to start with and then when we pointed out the mistake we were treated even more rudely! Make sure you check your bills!!!!! They tried to overcharge us by sgd 100s of dollars!!
French,L_Angelus,"Perfect Host, excellent food",50,3 March 2014,"Best dining experience in Singapore for years, food was excellent and service was ideal, host Guillaume made this one if the most enjoyable dining experiences in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Forgettable experience,20,8 February 2014,"I was at the restaurant with a friend for dinner. Food is decent. Forget about service. My expectations from such a high price setting restaurant comes with some service expectations. I was reasonably disappointed. My dining experience is served by a rude staff and other more decent service team. It dampens my dining experience totally. They have an uncanny ability to make one feel that it is through the sheer grace of the service team, one gets to have a french dining cuisine. Since I beg to differ, I will never come back again."
French,L_Angelus,Small French Restaurant in Club Street,40,30 January 2014,"L'Angelus... If you want french cuisine, just ""normal"" dishes, nothing super fancy, but really honest, then L'Angelus is the place to go. Excellent foie gras or escargots! Very good beef with a gratin dauphinois one couldn't do better at home. Nice location in Club Street, very cosy. I would go there anytime again! And i've been there on nearly all my visits to Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Customer service????,10,24 January 2014,My first review ever ... Shocking rude staff that could care less about happy customers. Decent food but I won't be coming back.
French,L_Angelus,Consistently good,40,11 January 2014,"This year marks 10 years in Singapore and I have been here many times. Last night a group of us turned up on spec and scored a table outside, sans reservation. Result, as it meant some people-watching was enabled and now Club St is busy as anything this was all good.We had nibbled snacks at the various bars that lay littered in our trail to the restaurant so starters were declined and we went straight to mains. 3 confit de canard and 1 bavette frites were swiftly ordered and we sat back with a bottle of reasonably priced St Emilion to watch people until the food arrived.I am a big fan of confit de canard and I think L'Angelus may do the best outside France in my opinion. Succulent and tender, with crisp skin, it is an art form. The game chips with are pungent with garlic and superbly salty, just right to offset the rich duck. Our steak-eating friend was deeply impressed with his steak, so that was good too, as he paid with the company Amex. Huzzah!Another bottle of red, this time the wine of the month, which was also reasonably priced, and we waddled away pleasantly replete."
French,L_Angelus,authentic french with fairly priced winelist,30,3 December 2013,"Good to see a restaurant that maintains the authentic French cusine instead of making the ""personal"" touch that is often seen in Singapore. Presentation of the food could improve and the service should need a bit of high-end restaurant training (they need to know what they are serving and the method of preparation when asked) but the taste was superb and the winelist impressive and faily priced. The location makes it a great place to start an evening out with french as it its right in the bar and club neighborhood."
French,L_Angelus,Pas Symapthetique.,30,1 December 2013,"It was my first time in L'Angelus for a couple of years,and it was disappointing.My previous memories of the restaurant had been happy ones but I thought the quality of the food had declined from what I remember.The evening began well-the decor is attractive,the greeting welcoming and the service attentive.The free taster of a fish mayonnaise was good.Our starters of pasta and of pate were bland,lacking in interest but not unpleasant.My main course of lamb was similarly bland and my companion's of duck confit was dry and uninteresting.The dessert we shared,a rum baba,was not to our liking at all,though maybe that was just our taste buds.The house wines we tried,a Cote du Rhone and a Bordeaux,were satisfactory.I think perhaps a problem with L'Angelus is that the menu is too large.The best restaurants in France have a small menu:I have even been in restaurants where there is no choice,you just get served what is available today,what has been bought fresh in the market that day.A menu this large pre-supposes that dishes are pre-prepared to a great degree,and thus lacking in freshness and usually originality."
French,L_Angelus,More of casual dining experience,30,18 November 2013,"It was my 1st time visiting L'Angelus, not quite high expectations but given the reviews i've read, was expecting something better.Deco is simple and it was fulled house on friday night so it was pretty noisy and the tables were pretty close to each other which has no privacy at all.Appetizer - started off with Escargots, this is kind of unique as it had a layer of crunchy bread with garlic butter on top of the escargots. It was nice but my friend and i felt it was too salty.Main - i had ribeye medium rare and the condiment was potato gratin, these 2 dishes were rather mediocre. My friend had lamb and she said nothing fantasticDesserts - Chocolate Lava cake, this was 1 of the best that i had. Have to give credits to the chef, the cake cast was thin and soft, taste and aroma of chocolate just made everything perfect. However, the crepes suzette was disappointment. It was dry and the pancakes were kind of thick, the presentation wasnt appetizing too.Overall - Would only go back for the chocolate lava cake. If your a couple looking for quiet, romantic place then this is not advisable."
French,L_Angelus,stilly my favourite restaurant in Club steeet...The best Steack on town,50,20 September 2013,go for the Chateaubriand steack to share for two persons...absolument Great! Very good and reasonably priced French wines... superb service with a manager trained as a sommelier. ..C'eat bon
French,L_Angelus,"I was disappointed, too",30,18 September 2013,"Like Matthew H., I, too, was disappointed. I didn’t have any expectations as the restaurant was selected by a client and I didn’t bother to look at reviews prior to going there. The ambiance is fine, though it was a little dark if that bothers anyone. I’m not sure I’d characterize the wait staff as indifferent but they certainly were not very attentive. Fortunately, we were sitting near the end of the bar and our waiter was regularly at the bar, so we were able to call him over when necessary. We ordered the duck foie gras for four (SGD $158) as a starter. It was excellent, though not as much as I’d expected for the price (two livers sliced at the table). I had the grilled tuna and the waiter asked if I wanted it pink. I answered in the affirmative but thought it a strange question given that in the U.S. one only gives cooking instructions if one doesn’t want it almost raw in the middle. If there was any pink when it arrived the room was too dim for me to see it. It was cooked well done and very, very chewy. For dessert I had the fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was small and impossible to tell if the strawberries really were fresh or frozen. Out of fairness, one of my companions had the veal and pronounced it excellent. Another companion had the roasted spring chicken and seemed equally impressed.I should also note that this restaurant isn't ranked as high on some other review sites."
French,L_Angelus,Good French Cuisine,50,15 July 2013,"My French colleague took us here, and the food did not disappoint. The service was great and we couldn't fault it, with great ambience and an interesting menu. The Terrine de Foi Gras was superb, and I had Magret de Canard (Roasted French duck breast) which was excellent. Good wine list also and one of my colleagues had Scottish salmon cooked in paper wrapping which looked superb. As my French colleague said, the chef is French and it shows!"
French,L_Angelus,Superb,50,23 May 2013,"My hubby invited me to dinner for our 3rd wedding anniversary. L'Angelus came highly recommended by our Swiss/French friends as having an authentic French menu. Besides the high quality of French cuisine, we were especially impressed by the immaculate service that Thierry (Directeur De Salle) provided. He received at the entrance upon our arrival and immediately ushered us to the best table in the house, private yet unsecluded. Throughout the entire dinner, he always ensured that we had everything we needed and there was literally no waiting time for arrive or food.Heading a 2-men service team in a full house, it was truly no easy feat to keep the diners happy and satisfied in which Thierry succeeded very well.It was truly a magnifique dining experience for our romantic anniversary dinner. We will definitely be back again!"
French,L_Angelus,Good food and great ambiance,40,19 May 2013,"Me and my girlfriend ate here. We were a bit in intimidated when we walk in but the staff member made us felt welcome. Menu is good. Food appetizing, delicious and very clean"
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing,30,5 May 2013,"My expectations were high based on previous reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed.Firstly I didn't find the staff particularly welcoming. We were the first to arrive for dinner at 19:30, it was hard to get a smile. Secondly, the staff were discrete but slow and we had to ask to place our order and it felt like an eternity before our plates were removed.The menu is quite extensive but they didn't have what I wanted, crayfish. I settles for a grilled fish, which turned out to be nothing special and expensive at over 50$. My girlfriend had a bavette which she found extremely oily and hardly touched.The restaurant itself is pleasant and offers a quality environment. My experience was disappointing to say the least. I won't go back. "
French,L_Angelus,Best french food in Singapore,50,31 March 2013,"Amazing restaurant, service was fantastic, all the waiters were very knowledgeable about the food and wine served in the restaurant. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, well presented, top quality produce. Simply the best dining experience I have had in Singapore. My husband and father shared La cote de boeuf angus, it was perfectly seasoned, top quality beef - mouth watering. I ordered the roast duck, again perfectly cooked served with a delicious rich (in colour and taste) fig sauce. La pièce de résistance was the famous hot chocolate cake - Magnificat!!Go and treat yourself to a top class foodie experience. Hats off to the chef."
French,L_Angelus,Best French food I had in last 15 years.,50,22 February 2013,"Amazing excellent French food.
My only very good experience in a Simgapore restaurant.
Must eat are the Escargot to be followed by Veal chop. Best items on the menu."
French,L_Angelus,Simply an excellent place to wine and dine,50,30 January 2013,"I have been a proud regular for many years and never had any cause for complaint.Some diners complain that the menu hardly changes and that, I think, is due to Gabi (owner and bon vivant) understanding what works and leaving a success as it is.I do not think there are many, if any places, in Singapore to rival the ambiance here leaving it booth perfect for romancers as it is for business lunches.I cannot rate L'Angelus high enough.Absolutely love it"
French,L_Angelus,Delicious French Food,50,25 January 2013,"Was there for a company dinner, food was fantastic as was the wine.
Prices were reasonable and the service OK.
Location-wise, also good as there are plenty of post-dinner places to enjoy the night air."
French,L_Angelus,ze french restaurant !,50,10 December 2012,"As a french, I lived in Paris for 15 years and I have been very delighted to find out L'Angelus in Singapore. I immediatly felt at home ! After having tried many fake french restaurants (poor set, industrial food), finally, here is the good one. Home made cuisine (tasty and delicate) very good wines at a reasonable price, ""service a la francaise"" and french patrons ! For business, with friends, with your wife... or your ''maitresse"", c'est l'endroit où il faut aller !"
French,L_Angelus,Happy Suprise,40,14 August 2012,"Went there last Thursday at National Day, ok was bit empty but didn't bother us. The service and Food was excellent, I was bit worried because sometimes these Restaurants in Club Street are Full of Guest anyway and I guess most Guest are just there to enjoy the Atmosphere, so some Restaurants might get bit sloppy with Service and the Quality of the Food, however L'Angelus was seem to made an exception, only little manko my Dover Sole could have been a little more Cross but that's all to complain about, nice Atmospahre like a French Bistro in Paris."
French,L_Angelus,Looking for an authentic French restaurant in Singapore? Simply the best!,50,11 August 2012,"Everything is perfect from the decor to the food to the ambiance... Take a special look at the walls covered of photos of French actors and famous French plays! As for the food, it's how it's supposed to be done! Even in France, it's difficult to find a better place for traditional French cuisine! "
French,L_Angelus,Bon Appitite,40,2 July 2012,"Went to L'Angelus for the first time on Saturday evening. Over all experience was good and food was excellent. Some minor issues with ambiance to note:It was Saturday evening around 9PM. A couple walked in wearing flip flops, beach short and tank tops. I was surprised the restaurant did not tell them they were not dressed appropriately. I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant and spend over 400.00 ( for 3) sitting next to people who look like they should be in a hawker centre. The restaurant should consider the feelings of the other guests. Some are there for special occasions and this just put a damper on it. Also, the wait staff and maître d left the restaurant before we were finished and after we had paid. (11pm) We were only finishing up our coffee. Felt a bit slighted to see the maitre d across the street at a martini bar after we left L'Angelus. It would have been nice to be thanked for our business and made to feel like our evening was complete.Iif you are looking to impress an important client or someone special - this may not be the place to take them. My humble opinion."
French,L_Angelus,Great French bistrot evening,40,12 June 2012,"This would be one of my favourites in Singapore: friendly, straightforward and delicious French fare. The prices are on the expensive side, but this is Singapore and French food tends to be pricey.We had the streak tartare -freshly prepared in front of your table, the onion soup and the grilled foie gras.The bistrot has a basic but workable wine list: we went for a couple of glasses of Côtes du Rhone and some sparkling water.All selections were delicious and well presented, and the staff was courteous and professional. We did not have dessert, as the mains were quite filling.Expect to pay about SGD120 per person with light wine consumption.In all, a very pleasant evening. We are coming back to L'Angelus."
French,L_Angelus,Great French Bistro Style Food,50,8 June 2012,"If you are looking for good quality and pretty authentic bistro style French food this is one of the places in Singapore to have it. Definitely go the Escargot for starter, assuming you like this type of thing, all the mains are great with good options for all tastes. My favorite is the duck and always check for what's on specials for the day. Wine list is good with a fair selection and a good range of pricing for Singapore.As with most good French restaurants be weary as the portions, both starters and mains are generous and generally very rich, have rarely gotten through three proper courses so if you are not a big eater decide early whether you are going for desert, if you like it there are great choices and the Creme Brûlée is almost a must."
French,L_Angelus,Nice Bistro food,40,18 April 2012,"Great food for a lunch stop, price was high but reasonable for Singapore and the food worth it. Has a nice athmosphere and good service"
French,L_Angelus,Lunchtime Bistro Food At Fine Dining Prices,40,17 March 2012,"Generally nice food, but very expensive for basic bistro cuisine. $46++ for Cassoulet, which is basically a bowl of baked beans with some lumps of meat, is a bit of a cheek. Nice ambience & good service, but I left feeling slightly ripped off in terms of value."
French,L_Angelus,"The wrong place for a French ""Art of Life"" experience",10,10 February 2012,"A very basic interior design. We could have expected better French touch to beautify this nice shophouse in the heart of a historical street of Singapore. Very dim light, dark enough to hardly decipher the menu. Fortunately, the service was fine and courteous. The main issue was the food. The menu is very poor, proposing the same skinny shortlist of stereotype French food that several so called French Restaurants in Singapore serve at exorbitant price, under the pretext that French food is very special. Hundreds of other delicious French recipes are left aside, presumably because they are longer to prepare than heating the content of a mason jar in a microwave. The duck confit that we ordered was by far overcooked and stringy. The home made chips were dripping with oil, dark and hardened by overcooking. The bread of the onion soup was impossible to chew due to a cheese layer harder than a sole. We were not taken by the pricey wine. Only the chicken was nice. But it can’t justify the astronomic bill we had to foot. Not to mentioned that our successive remarks to the waiter on the cooking issues didn’t have any impact on him or on the management. We felt totally cheated and scandalized. French cooking can offer such inventive and diverse tastes at reasonable price. It is sad that some unscrupulous entrepreneur make their business on local attraction and ignorance for French cuisine. Don’t waste your time and money. There are some other reliable French restaurants in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,"Delicious desserts, reasonable price",40,30 January 2012,"When I eat at L’Angelus, it reminds me the Brasserie atmospheres we have in France. The place is lovely and nicely decorated with old French advertisings. The service staffs know about French cuisine, they easily give advices on the menu without pushing orders. They are thoughtful, taking back your empty dishes once you finish.Last time I went there, I had a Lyon Sausage as starter. This is quite exceptional to find such a classical French dish in Singapore and it was delicious. This kind of sausage contains pistachio; it was served with roasted potatoes. For the main, I had a perfectly medium rare cooked lamb with gratin Dauphinois. My Singaporean friend tried to prevent me for eating the lamb: he was scared I have a food poisoning because he thought the meat was undercooked! I have noticed that most people like very well done meat here but a good meat must be tender and tasty, therefore rare. Overcook a meat makes it dry and takes all the flavours off. Some French people even like their meat so rare we can still see blood at the core!! Anyway, the Chef at l’Angelus knows how to cook a good piece of meat, the lamb was perfect!The dessert was maybe my favourite. No one should leave the Angelus without trying the thin apple pie a la Normande served with a cinnamon ice-cream! The chocolate lava cake my friend too was quite common compared to the desert I choose. We spent about $100 to $120 each what is quite correct for the quality of the food served. The prices for the bottle of wine are reasonable as well.To check more restaurants, visit my blog: http://www.frenchrestaurantinsingapore.blogspot.com/"
French,L_Angelus,expensive but doesn't have to be,40,29 January 2012,"When you step into L'Angelus, you certainly step into a little bit of France. This is an expensive restaurant but a great little one. Mains are around $40-50 and the starters around $20. I've lived and cheffed in France and the snails were the best I've come across especially when you put their greasy bread topping to one side. We each had the steak tartare, mixed by the front of house staff behind us and accompanied by fries. I have to say though, I love my food but this was too big a portion and just the right size for two to share. The same can be said for the creme brulee. When we go back I think we'll go all lady and the trampy and share each course. I think L'Angelus would be better served by cutting the portion sizes which would let them cut the prices. Until then... just share your meals! We had superb service despite the restaurant being full."
French,L_Angelus,Terrible service,10,28 January 2012,The food is pretty good but not for the price. The service is awful!
French,L_Angelus,Great french food,50,23 November 2011,"The Chateaubriand carved at the table and potatoes dauphinoise that came with it were amazing! As were the blinis with caviar. The service was very good, wine was always topped up and even though we arrived quite late were not rushed at all. The wine list is good and really there is nothing to complain about. The place has a laid back homey feel feel to it so it is comfortable even if you are not dressed to nines. I went with a visiting friend and she is still a month later emailing about how great it was! I think its good for dates, with friends and groups and because the food is so good, also for business dinners."
French,L_Angelus,Unbelievable,50,21 October 2011,"Verdict: This place takes the top spot for the best food experience I’ve ever encountered. My main meal was fantastic and the dessert topped things off. Fortunately, I got to eat a reasonable portion of my cousin’s creme brullee which was absolutely amazing. He too thoroughly enjoyed his mains, wine, and dessert. Look past the price tag, this place is a must try. At least come in for the creme brullee. Please!Price: ExpensiveTaste: DeliciousValue: ExcellentRecommendation: Highly Recommend"
French,L_Angelus,Best French Restaurant in Singapore bar none!,50,29 September 2011,"The steak tartare is made fresh at your table! Tastes like heaven! If you want quality, generous French food with a very affordable wine list you have to go here!
Merci & a bientot!"
French,L_Angelus,Delicious and authentic,50,18 September 2011,The Cassoulet and cheese platter were excellent! Would recommend
French,L_Angelus,Constant quality... and affordable!,50,12 September 2011,"Went there 3 times for complete meals and I have to say that I enjoyed the experience a lot. The food is exactly the same quality as during my childhood (I'm French), homey style and tasty. Foie gras, Salade nicoise (the true one, with green beans), Crême brûlée (not heavy on the stomach, not too much sweetened). All these classical are done quite well, and in a generous portions... The cheeses are just mature and tasty enough, and the wine selection very worth for the price. Yes, the service is sometimes relaxed (not a person constantly looking over your shoulders), but, in my opinion, much better if you wanna appreciate the authentic atmosphere and the good food. Not the mention the excellent bread that comes with your plate and the free appetizers (peanuts and olive). This is the place to go for tasting wine and cheese, less hyped but much more worth than Wine Connection for instance..."
French,L_Angelus,Gone downhill,20,21 August 2011,I have lived in Singapore for over 10 years and have frequented this place a lot on the basis it was reliable - although never fantastic. We went with some friends and the food and service can only be described as very ordinary. I think this place has had its time and although the rude staff used to be a bit of a novelty........its now got tiresome. I have been there a lot but i would never go again.
French,L_Angelus,You can't have both the food and the service bad. Must choose one!,10,17 August 2011,"Both the service and the food are well below par.Service: what's the point of putting tables outside if you're not going to to station a waiter outside? I had to walk in to ask for our bill!Food: I've had better beef cuts at hooters! Super premium prices for cheap beef cuts, overpriced everything. Meat under cooked. (asked for medium rare, got a cow that talked back to me)Overall, no reason to go back there with so many great choices in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,"Shoosh, don't let the word get out.",50,16 August 2011,"L'Angelus is a romantic French restaurant tucked away in Chinatown. It has a real Parisian flair with classic French dishes. Food is amazing, it almost makes me want to move to Singapore.Last time I was here we had pan-fried foie gras, goats cheese salad and escargot for entree and confit duck for main. The escargot was amazing but I wish I hadn't eaten on the plane as I would have loved to have the steak tartare also. Good wine selection also.L'Angelus is a place to go and enjoy with good friends or someone special."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent,50,17 April 2011,"Excellent food ant atmosphere.
The steak I ate was delicious."
French,L_Angelus,"Rude, rude, rude...",10,11 November 2009,"... if you are looking for authentic Parisian service, this is the place to go... the wait staff all seem to wish they were somewhere else, and the manager (French) has that certain je ne sais quoi which let's you know you are only there out of his kindness and not because you are a customer..."
